    <small>By David Watts</small></font></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The Internet has much to amuse us. In the paper this column
    has pointed out the simple pleasures of the <a
    href="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?">AltaVista translation
    engine</a> and a few good <a href="http://www.pythonline.com">Monty Python</a> sites.
    There are many more places to go for a good laugh.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">But before we look at them, it is important to remember that
    humour -- like beauty -- is in the eye (maybe that should also be ear) of the beholder. It
    depends on your mood. Monty Python's Flying Circus was all the rage on TV in the early
    70s.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The unfortunate side-effect was that the show spawned
    hundreds of spotty wannabes, who deluged every party and other social occasion with their
    John Cleese impersonations and declamations of the Dead Parrot sketch, or tuneless
    renderings of the Lumberjack Song.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">What was priceless when heard the first time, and treasured
    on the second, third or fourth repeats, became a bore. As the 70s subsided, these
    imitators grew less; seeming to swap their flares for the double-breasted suits of the
    greedy 80s.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">But thanks to the wonders of modern technology they are back.
    Hundreds, more probably thousands, of Python lovers are a mouse-click away on the Net.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Judging by the hundreds of sites I have peeked at in the past
    week, they are even sillier than their older siblings of the 70s. Or maybe they are the
    same people and the facility to sit for hours in front of a word-processor or HTML editor
    somehow provokes the Silly Walks or Spam, Spam genes. Because out there in cyberspace are
    more copies of the Dead Parrot, Nudge-Nudge, Cheese Shop, Life of Brian and Meaning of
    Life songs, pictures, audio clips and video footage than can possibly be imagined.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Any nearly every Python site is written in
    Cleese-Chapman-Palin-Idle-Jones style . . . dead silly. Some people are good at this; many
    are not. They are all imitators. And, if you are in the right mood, bless them.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Here are just a very few of the places you can find a good
    argument or marvel at upper class twittery: <a
    href="http://www.stone-dead.asn.au">*Stone Dead Productions*</a> is an
    Australian site with just about everything you ever needed to know, or knew already, about
    Python. It features plenty of good
    links to other sites as well as a window on the very silly <a
    href="news:alt.fan.monty-python">*alt.fan.monty-python*</a> newsgroup.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">And that's all I'm going to tell you about Python sites. If
    you don't find what you're looking for in the links from the above site, your brain is not
    working; or your ISP's network has given up.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Now for something completely different -- the Goons. If
    Python imitators got on your goat in the 70s, you should have been around in the 50s. The
    voices were of Eccles, Major Bloodnock, Moriarty, Bluebottle and Neddy Seagoon. Spike
    Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Seccombe transformed the world of comic entertainment
    with this first truly popular appeal to straight silliness.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Sadly, the Goons do not appear as well represented on the Web
    as Python. It comes as no surprise that Goon sites are far less graphic and far less
    colourful than Python ones. The show was on radio after all, so Web sites in its honour
    are primarily text-based to reflect the interest in Milligan's mad words.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, a trawl through many promised Goon links
    revealed lots that had vanished or simply would not respond. As Henry Crun would say:
    &quot;They can't get the wood, you know.&quot;</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">But have a look at the <a
    href="http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/Goons/">*Goon Show Archive*</a>, an Australian site with
    lots of scripts and sounds; and <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~eccles/">*Goon Show
    Episodes*</a>, another homegrown one, which will provoke plenty of tears of nostalgia and
    mirth. Or maybe not . . . it depends on your mood.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Rest assured there is a naughty surprise at one of these
    sites. If Sellers was your favourite Goon, do yourself a favour and check out both the <a
    href="http://www.rk.net/pinkpanther/ppmain.html">*Pink Panther Page*</a> and the <a
    href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~jms8142/">*Peter Sellers Page*</a>. You can download some
    priceless audio clips of his Inspector Clouseau days.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">And if you feel like a more general romp, have a look at <a
    href="http://whatsfunny.farfan.com/">*What's Funny on the Internet Today*</a> and the
    BBC's <a href="http://www.comedyzone.beeb.com/">*Comedy Zone*</a>. For those who want to
    pay money and subscribe to the once-free Slate, the Diaries of Bill Gates are a laugh a
    minute . . . not.</font></small></td>
