            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>Varsity Blues (M)<br>James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight<br>Directed by Brian Robbins<br>Review: David Watts<br>H H<br>ONE image that lingers from the teen film Varsity Blues is of the chief cheerleader trying to seduce the high school team's new star quarterback.<br>She does this by wearing three strategically placed dollops of whipped cream, and nothing else.<br>The quarterback, John Moxon (played by James Van Der Beek of TV's Dawson's Creek) does not fall for the charms displayed so amply by the drop-dead gorgeous blonde, Darcy (Ali Larter).<br>In fact it is hard to fall for anything in this stereotypical tale of small-town heroism built around a high school football team nearing the end of a season with a near-<br>perfect winning streak.<br>But teenagers seem to consider Varsity Blues as ?pretty cool?.<br>Perhaps it is the music - Green Day, for example - laid on in big chunks by the MTV producers.<br>Varsity Blues is the movie equivalent of junk food, but teens like that sort of thing, even if their parents urge them to try something more nutritious.<br>Critics writing off Varsity Blues for its sheer laziness and boofheaded cliches face a target audience who will not be interested.<br>The story takes place in West Canaan, Texas, which looks about as big as Katanning, has only one religion and that is football.<br>Coach Kilmer (Jon Voight) is a reptilian dictator who uses Hitlerian hand movements when he rallies the school before a big game.<br>The tension rises when laid-back quarter back Moxon (Van Der Beek) becomes leader of the team after an injury to their star player.<br>Moxon's irreverent approach comes into conflict with the coach's inflexible game plan.<br>But the cinematic cliches start to flow well before Moxon's team needs a touchdown to beat the opposition.<br>The film switches to slow-motion for the football scenes for four or five minutes to ensure every drop of sweat, every rib-<br>rattling tackle, every lump in the spectators' throats, every flowing run, and every roar from the sidelines is captured.<br>Can you guess what happens? Will Moxon's team win the little town's 23rd consecutive divisional title? Will Moxon eschew the scholarship to the ritzy university where he has his sights set on a world outside football?<br>Will coach Kilmer, who has departed in a sulk, make a last-second conversion and become the father figure everyone in town craves? Will Moxon's football-hating girlfriend Julie (Amy Smart) take her boy back to her heaving bosom?<br>What of the sexy sex education teacher Miss Davis (Tonie Perensky)? Will she again wiggle her tattooed buttocks in the faces of her boy students on a night out to the strip joint where she does interesting moonlighting work?<br>Varsity Blues does not go too deeply into any of these questions.<br>It is awful and an awful lot of teens will like it.<br></font></p>
