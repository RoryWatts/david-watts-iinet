            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It is a mixed blessing that I do not carry Visa or Mastercard. I would be broke if I did. But on the other hand, I could wallow in all the great books, CDs and software that are so easy to buy over the Net.<br>The treasure trove of bookstores online seems the hardest to resist, particularly as June heralds the start of the best reading weather, when you can tuck yourself up in front of a fire and escape to another world while the rain beats down and the wind howls.<br>Far from breeding illiteracy - a fear I have heard from concerned parents - computers in tandem with the Net appear to promote it.<br>Books have not magically found a new medium on which to be read. Far from it. The annoying thing about computers, particularly desktops, is that you cannot curl up in bed with them for a good read.<br>And far too many books online are presented in badly designed HTML that lets text flow from one side of a screen to the other, sometimes on poor backgrounds or in badly designed typefaces, that severely test the power of the eyeballs and the patience.<br>The only good medium for a book is paper, bound and covered, portable, durable and able to be borrowed or lent.<br>Newspapers and magazines have flocked to the Net as well. They adapt to the computer screen much more easily than books because of shorter articles and mostly better design.<br>But you still cannot take them on the bus or train or to the beach that easily, even if you have a lightweight laptop whose browser cache is full to the gills, or have the money and confidence to connect to your ISP from a digital mobile phone.<br>The best of both worlds, then, appears to be to use the Net to browse and buy.<br>Instead of going all the way to The Well bookshop in Subiaco, for instance - even if you live in Subiaco - you can browse and buy from its wonderful online store. You can even vote for the book which you think should win the Miles Franklin Award, due to be announced on Thursday.<br>Leading contender last Friday was The Sound of One Hand Clapping by Richard Flanagan.<br>Or you can shop online at the Australia-wide Dymocks, one of the country's biggest booksellers. Subscribers can receive regular newsletters about new releases.<br>The king of online shopping in the literary world is Amazon.com which is cited as the best example of traditional business embracing the Net and succeeding.<br>A contender to Amazon's crown as the world's biggest online bookseller is Barnes & Noble, owner of the world's biggest real-world bookstore in New York. Its site boasts 400,000 searchable titles and a 20 per cent discount on all paperbacks in stock.<br>Ozbooks is another rival to Amazon and has discounts of between 5 and 40 per cent, while Sydney's Gleebooks enters the online fray as Australian Bookseller of the Year in both 1995 and 1997.<br>Those few are just the tip of the Net's literary iceberg. You can find more at the Sydney Morning Herald's Icon Net Guide, or at my own site.<br>And if you really want to read books on screen try Bibliomania, the Classics Archive or an excellent WA-created resource at Susie's Online Books.<br>If you would like to see writers who are using the Web to test their publishing prowess, try AGoodBook.com, which touts itself as the world's smallest bookstore and offers new novels for under $10.<br></font></p>
