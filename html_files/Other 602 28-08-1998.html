            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE HAVE probably all seen one or known one, maybe even talked to one. Maybe some of us are one.<br>I am talking about characters, the people who often through no fault of their own enrich other's lives by refusing to abide by what the majority might consider the norm.<br>As a child growing up in country Queensland, I remember a fair share of them.<br>First there was Lift Your Feet, a poor dishevelled old man who tied his trousers with rope and wore the dirtiest heavy coat in all weathers. If he was a bed you could say he had never been made.<br>He used to shuffle around town with an old sugar bag over his shoulder. And he literally did shuffle because of an injury that kept his poor old legs planted firmly to the ground.<br>One day, so local legend went, he had enough of people crying out ?lift your feet? as he stumbled his weary way around town.<br>He slouched off to the police station to protest. As he entered the duty sergeant's area, he tripped over the doorway.<br>?Lift your feet,? yelled the sensitive Queensland flatfoot.<br>Then there was an old man (it takes years to become a character) known as Gentleman Jim. He dressed superbly in what appeared to be a white linen suit, replete with silk cravat, rakishly angled hat and a silver-handled cane.<br>One day while I was standing beside a potential sweetheart and summoning up the courage to speak to her, Gentleman Jim tiptoed past, struck me a light tap on the bottom and said: ?Go for it my boy, she's lovely.?<br>This naturally caused much blushing, mumbling and bursting of pimples, so that the lovely young girl slumped off, dejected by yet another amateur boyish courting effort . . . albeit by yet another amateur boy. Hopefully someone summoned up the courage to make a GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) of her.<br>But back to characters. I was forced into these reveries by a letter from reader Rod Gaynor who wants to know whether he is seeing things, or has sighted a genuine character.<br>Rod writes: ?. . . I have dubbed him The Hairy Rider. Anyone who drives down Charles Street at rush hour would have seen him.<br>?For the uninitiated, The Hairy Rider is a very hairy man who rides his dilapidated bicycle on Charles Street at rush hour. Nothing really remarkable about that. However, The Hairy Rider has a number of qualities that raise the interest of all of us safely encased in our motorised transport.<br>?FIRST, The Hairy Rider wears a pair of shoes, a pair of grey shorts, and a helmet - no matter what the prevailing conditions. Experienced commuters have witnessed him in the sizzling heat of summer and the freezing wet mornings of mid-winter. No matter what the weather. The Hairy Rider plods down Charles Street dressed only in a pair of shoes, grey shorts and a helmet.<br>?We fry for him in summer, we shiver for him in winter - he seems not to care.<br>?Secondly, The Hairy Rider is really, really, really hairy.<br>?Third, The Hairy Rider rides his dilapidated bicycle with a single-minded determination that brings feelings of guilt to us lesser mortals. He never changes his pace, his back is always ramrod straight, his expression never alters, he never seems to breathe hard.<br>?He just rides, hairy and shirtless, down Charles Street. We pass him and marvel. We stop at the lights. He passes us. We pass him again and marvel again. The process repeats until the Freeway on-ramp.<br>?Fourthly, we conjecture, probably correctly, that The Hairy Rider is also commuting to some unknown workplace. There comes the final question. What mode of employment considers a pair of shoes and a pair of grey shorts acceptable dress??<br>Can anyone out there help put Rod - and now me - out of his misery?<br>Last week I wrote that Lionel Long could be one of many Australian singers able to be called up to sing the national anthem at the Commonwealth Games. Unfortunately, the jovial balladeer passed away earlier this year. My apologies.<br></font></p>
