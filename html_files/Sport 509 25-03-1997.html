            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE SHOULDN'T talk about cricket should we? Australia's fragile performance against South Africa and WA's capitulation to Queensland are not happy topics.<br>Unless you are a South African or a Queenslander. As fate would have it I was born 160km from Brisbane, played college cricket with Bulls coach John Buchanan and made the Gabba hill my second home when I should have been studying.<br>So this column is very happy to talk Sheffield Shield until the cows - Bulls rather - come home.<br>Queensland has no right to be in the driver's seat for its second-only shield. The team started the season well but succumbed to a traditional slump that used to be blamed on touring the southern States, then on cyclonic weather.<br>It just made this final in a three-way tussle with Tasmania and NSW. And now here it is turning WA's vaunted batting line-up into an inept joke.<br>Thanks to Channel 9, cricket lovers have been watching the final live every day. Or should I say they have had the chance to watch it.<br>Actually, there are few faster ways to turn off a TV than to see the cricketing enemy flailing your attack and leaving a target of 465.<br>On Sunday, Nine showed the final from 1pm, which was precisely the most painful time for loyal Sandgropers as Trevor Barsby and Stuart Law turned the screws with resolute batting.<br>Barsby's farewell 111 was an innings of great character.<br>What many of the commentators forgot while watching this was that WA did not actually have to win the match to win the shield.<br>A draw would suffice for the top-of-table Warriors. Queensland, on the other hand, had to win.<br>But talking head after talking head, whether they were West Australian or Queenslander, kept saying what a hard target WA had to get.<br>On the whole, the commentary was OK despite that, and Greg Ritchie and Jeff Thomson were very even-handed with their comments; at times even joining the talking-up of WA which our own commentators seem prone to.<br>One moment where it was impossible to be even-handed was during a spell by Warrior Brad Hogg.<br>Keeper Adam Gilchrist kept shouting ?good ball? after each delivery. The commentary team agreed, tongues in cheeks, that it was good if you meant hitting the middle of the bat was the aim.<br>Effects microphones sometimes add to sport coverage, but one place they should be banned is anywhere near an umpire or referee.<br>The ABC's Super League coverage is still dominated by the non-stop nagging of the ref. And in the background of Sunday's match between Penrith and Cronulla could be heard the most dreadful American music and an announcer growling ?Panther power? to encourage the disappointing crowd.<br>Similar sounds could be heard on Nine's ridiculously late telecast of Perth Reds wonderful thrashing of Canterbury from Perth Oval. Can't these little Super League crowds think for themselves?<br>The 74,000 at the MCG at Friday night's AFL Ansett Cup final certainly did. The mumbling from so many was proof that Geelong might be a good team, but not in finals footy.<br>David Watts can be contacted via e-mail: watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
