            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ON WEDNESDAY I decided to search for the meaning of life. This is known in classical terms as a big ask. It had to be done.<br>Why? Last Saturday Essendon demolished my Eagles, dismembering their premiership hopes in a hoop-la of red and black ecstasy. I took it like a man: got drunk, sulked, kicked next-door's cat and blamed everyone else.<br>By Tuesday I realised something had to be done to try to fill this aching void ... hence a search for the meaning of life was just the tonic.<br>Also the dog had been cowering under the bed for three days having rarely seen me in a ?oh no the Eagles have lost? mood ... and he'd seen me with the cat.<br>First stop in the quest for meaning was the Internet. I have a computer beside my bed and it wasn't far to lurch.<br>There was evidence that this path has been sought before, and not with great success either. A place called the Why Ask Why page contained a list of questions, which because of their sparkling brilliance, could not be avoided before really embarking on the journey to enlightenment.<br>Just because the Why Ask Why page is compiled by avid computer users does not mean it is invalid. Computer users are just like ordinary people.<br>In fact, the only way to tell them apart is that they have really big, red eyes from looking at the screen all day, big bottoms from sitting in front of said screen, and misshapen wrists from clicking a mouse continually.<br>Apart from that, there's nothing to distinguish them from Norm and Nolly Normal down the street. So their views of life's more intriguing questions are fair enough.<br>And here are some of the questions they pose:<br>?Why isn't phonetic spelt the way it sounds?<br>?Why do fat chance and slim chance mean the same thing?<br>?Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?<br>?If 7-11 stores are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors?<br>?Why isn't ?palindrome? spelled the same way backwards?<br>?Why is it that when you transport something by car, it's called a shipment, but when you transport something by ship, it's called cargo?<br>?You know that little indestructible black box that is used on planes, why can't they make the whole plane out of the same substance?<br>?Why is it so hard to remember how to spell ?mnemonic??<br>?Why is it called a TV ?set? when you get only one?<br>?Why does your nose run and your feet smell?<br>?Why is there a use-by date on sour cream?<br>?Shouldn't there be a shorter word for ?monosyllabic??<br>?Why is the word ?abbreviate? so long?<br>?Why did kamikaze pilots wear helmets?<br>?When they ship styrofoam, what do they pack it in?<br>?Why are they called ?stands? when they're made for sitting?<br>?Why is there only one monopolies commission?<br>?What did Geronimo say when he jumped out of a plane?<br>That is only a random selection. There were many more, and the way things go on the Net, there will be many, many more in a few weeks as people with red eyes, big bottoms and funny wrists add their quandaries. Once they get a sniff of the imponderables on the Why Ask Why page, they will drop their worthy documents on brain surgery, alien life forms and the best TV jingle (such things are discussed in cyberspace all the time) to ask their favourite question with no answer.<br>If there is an answer to ?what is the meaning of life? it lies as hidden as always while the question falls like a rock to the bottom of the queue.<br>I wonder why?
