            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The National Gallery, London<br>www.nationalgallery.org.uk<br>The National Gallery faces Trafalgar Square in London in the real world and is one of the greatest repositories of European art in the world. In cyberspace, the National Gallery also ranks as one of the greatest art galleries on the Web. People who have Microsoft's Art Gallery CD-ROM will be familiar with the collection of works that dates from the 12th century and includes Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Titian, Veronese, Rembrandt and nearly every other household name. The site allows users to browse the various collections - physically impossible to walk through properly in less than a couple of days in the real gallery - and click on major titles. An image of the painting, its history and historical notes about the artist are then presented on screen. The use of a very wide frame across the bottom of the screen to show paintings almost gives the feel of a real gallery. (DW)<br>The People's Century<br>www.pbs.org/wgbh/<br>peoplescentury<br>The People's Century was one of those must-watch shows on TV last year. However, if you missed it, this site presented by America's Public Broadcasting Service captures the drama of our century, setting out in easy-to-follow detail the main sections of the documentary series. Each chapter - the Age of Hope, the Killing Fields, People Power etc - has its own section. There is a teacher's guide and an excellent inter-active addition which allows users to add their own stories. (DW)<br>Cliche Finder<br>www.westegg.com/cliche<br>Sometimes a well-delivered cliche can make or break a particular situation and it pays to have a good store of cliches up your sleeve in case you are the one who needs to do the delivery. Thanks to the Cliche Finder, you can sift through more than 3000 little gems appropriate for any number of situations. The online search facility allows you to type in a word and any cliches containing that word are displayed quicker than you can say boo. Take, for example, the word pig - in no time at least 15 cliches, some not entirely fit for family viewing, are listed. ?Pleased as a pig in mud? could be used in all manner of situations. There is also a list of 10 random cliches in case you want to do some browsing and a link to other cliche sites. Now that's better than a slap in the face with a wet fish! (SS)<br>Scottish Tiddlywinks Association<br>www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/<br>~ben/tiddlywinks<br>You know the Web has spread to every important part of life when such a venerable organisation as the Scottish Tiddlywinks Association sets up its own site. And it is serious. Although the STwA admits to between only 10 and 20 members, it is dedicated to what it terms ?the modern game of tiddlywinks?. The actual game dates to Victorian times but was formalised only 40 years ago. Did you know that the real difference between tiddlywinks supported by STwA and the popular children's game - which just involves flicking tiddlywinks into a pot - is the addition of the squop. A squop is a shot in which a player sends one of her/his winks so that in its resting place, it is wholly or partially above one of the opponent's winks. Fascinating stuff . . . and without the Web we would never have known. (DW)<br>Lonely Planet<br>www.lonelyplanet.com<br>Lonely Planet travel guides have become the bibles for travellers looking for a bit more than the tourist experience. The Australian-based publisher's Web site is equally as useful, with destination reviews, interactive maps, travellers' tips and a billboard where people can post and answer queries from others. There is up-to-date travel news from around the world, including updates on no-go zones such as Indonesia. A selection of offerings from Lonely Planet's Journeys series - travel tales which make enjoyable reading - is also available. It is a well-designed, fast and functional site that, like the guide books, gets down to the nitty-gritty. If you're going somewhere, thinking about it or just want to learn about the big wide world, this site is for you. (SS)<br>Small Business Development Corporation of WA<br>www.sbdc.com.au<br>Advice and information are the highlights at the WA Small Business Development Corporation's site. Interested users can discover the hows and whys of starting a business, buying a business, developing an existing one or exploring the possibilities of expansion. A winner's circle focuses on achievement awards possible for small business owners. A special section is devoted to women in small business and there is a list of frequently asked questions.
