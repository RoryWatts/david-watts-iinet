            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet has been a virtual sea of anger and disbelief throughout the Easter break because the Federal Government last Wednesday left the back door open for timed data calls.<br>News of the passage of Telstra Bills allowing timed calls was eclipsed by the euthanasia debate. Many worried Net users were not aware of the move until Good Friday.<br>Since then newsgroups and discussion lists have run hot. Web sites have sprung up quickly, giving background information, e-mail addresses of Telstra and politicians, and petitions against timed calls.<br>The Telstra legislation concerns billing methods after part-privatisation on July 1. Untimed local voice and data calls are guaranteed for residential users as are untimed local voice calls for business. Strangely an amendment sponsored by the Democrats to give rural customers access to untimed local calls made it into the legislation.<br>But the legislation does not give the same guarantee for local business data calls which include the growing traffic on the Net.<br>A well-publicised scenario is that Internet service providers will be charged for receiving modem calls from their customers. The resulting increased costs will be passed back to customers or ISPs will bear them.<br>Many of Australia's 470 ISPs are very small businesses, so the likelihood is that they will not be able to bear the costs. The fear is that some will be forced to close and that residential Net users will pay more.<br>In the newsgroup aus.general last Friday, Paul McCutcheon of Omen Internet services told hundreds of posters how he thought ISPs might bill residential customers in future.<br>?Due to Omen Internet now being charged to receive your call, and being charged at a timed rate basis for that call, that cost is now being passed directly on to you,? Mr McCutcheon wrote.<br>?Telstra charges us (X) cents per minute to receive your call. The total number of minutes you have spent online to Omen Internet for this month is (Y) minutes. Therefore you have accrued: X¢ x Ymin = $(XY).<br>?The sum of $(XY) has now been added to your bill.?<br>Federal Communications Minister Senator Richard Alston fought off an Opposition amendment that would have guaranteed untimed business data calls. He would not allow non-data users to subsidise Net traffic.<br>But Telstra executives, who have used congestion as an argument for the introduction of timed calls for all users this year, have yet to produce any evidence to back up their claims.<br>Daniel Clark of MacroTec Australia, who set up an online petition against timed calls, told subscribers to the Stop Tel$tra mailing list.<br>?We believe that these developments place all ISPs and Internet users in a very vulnerable position in which Telstra can use predatory charging to take over the Internet business in Australia,? he said.<br>?Telstra's argument has always been that the Internet is causing undue congestion in the telephone network and that they must recoup the costs.<br>?All reports of this nature have been authoritatively debunked. Even the Government Senate Committee did not feel the evidence Telstra presented to it stood up to scrutiny.<br>URLs<br>AN ON-LINE petition against timed data calls had attracted more than 6600 signatures by yesterday morning.<br>The petition, set up by MacroTec Australia on Good Friday, was attracting an average of 100 signatures an hour at the weekend.<br>MacroTec said at a Web page accompanying the petition that the Telstra legislation would mean the death of an affordable Internet in Australia.?As the source of connectivity for hundreds of ISPs in Australia, this will allow Telstra to strangle Australia's ISP industry by raising their charges. In turn, these charges will be passed on to the consumer,? MacroTec said.?Companies will lose their clients and go out of business. Gradually, Telstra will take over Australia's ISP community, and the age of affordable Internet access will end.?<br>The Web has dozens of sites on the Telstra timed calls.
