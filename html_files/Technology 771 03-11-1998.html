            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT a difference a month makes in the world of software.<br>At the beginning of October the small Norwegian team responsible for the Opera Web browser was celebrating the c-net award for software of the year. But by the end, the developers were lamenting the failure of an experiment to produce the browser for non-Windows systems.<br>Opera made a stunning debut at the start of the year. Instead of offering a 10Mb download with accompanying chat, mail and HTML editing programs that needed lots of PC power, Opera came as a simple, light and fast alternative to the browser giants, Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>Weighing in at just over one megabyte, Opera captured the imagination of software reviewers for its speed, flexibility and ability to be used on old systems.<br>Users have taken longer than reviewers to fall in love with Opera for one simple reason - they have to pay about $50 for it after a 30-day free trial.<br>Opera Software wanted to improve the browser's compatibility with non-Windows systems, but it told Wired News last week that its ambitious project to produce Linux and Macintosh versions had failed to meet deadline and the original development team had been replaced.<br>Opera versions for the Amiga and OS/2 also would be late, the company said. Its priority still is to develop a Mac version.<br></font></p>
