            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I AM indebted to Noel Stephens of Bullcreek for putting me on the right track to finding the meaning of life. Readers may recall I took a wrong turn on the Internet recently and was confronted by dozens of questions without answers.<br>Such bafflers as ?Why is phonetic not spelt as it sounds?? certainly foiled a worthy quest. Colleague Rod Moran tried to help by reminding me of the one attributed to Groucho Marx: ?Why is a duck??<br>Thanks Rod, I don't think. All that one allowed me to do was to contemplate smart answers to naggers. You know, if you run into someone you'd rather not see and they say: ?Where's that $40 you owe me from 1991?? You could always answer ?Why is a duck,? provided of course that you were running in the general direction of away already.<br>But Noel Stephens wrote to me (via computer as good Net users do) and told me I was looking in quite the wrong place.<br>He directed my attention to the home page of the Meaning Of Life and Everything Society (MOLES), and I duly visited.<br>One of the first things I noticed was a convenient listing of places to go to discuss the meaning of life with like-minded people. On the list was the Sail and Anchor Hotel in Fremantle, where I once had a bucks' party at which the meaning of life presented itself about 10pm. Unfortunately none of the bucks really cared by then and kept drinking dog bolters or funny drinks like that.<br>But the MOLES page on the Net has several branches of knowledge to climb along to learn more about life. As they pick these fruits of wisdom they can reassemble their own thoughts and join the MOLES' very own subscription e-mail list which allows everyone connected to send their dollar's worth to everyone else.<br>Such an aggregation of knowledge possibly could be greater than the sum of its parts and crack the meaning. If not, the exercise of grey matter in such a healthy way must provide a few insights into lesser problems (perhaps they could find out why is a duck?).<br>One of the trains of thought that caught my eye was the one discussing author Douglas Adams' contention in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy that the answer to the meaning of life is 42. All we lack is the question ... But here in cyberspace - at http://www.ipacific.net.au/moles/ to be precise - you learn that:<br>?The first sighting of 42's significance was in the Bible (2 Kings 2:23-24) where Elisha went unto Bethel. He was mocked by children because of his bald head and, according to Kings, ?(He) cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and 40 and two children of them.?<br>?The Book of Revelation is alive with significant 42 meanings, including 1260 days (42 months) was the length of the prophetic mission of the two witnesses;<br>?From Revelation 11:2: ?But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for 42 months?;<br>?The holy book of Judaism, the Torah, is broken into columns, each of which always have exactly 42 lines of Hebrew;<br>?It took God six days to create the universe. He rested on the seventh day which is considered to be holy by many. 6 x 7 = guess what?<br>There followed pages of mathematical signs of 42's power but I was impressed already.<br>What to do with that much powerful information is the next question. I think it should be discussed at the Sail and Anchor, or somewhere equally salubrious.<br></font></p>
