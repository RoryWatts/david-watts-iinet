            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">REGULAR readers of this column will know that last month I attended the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones. It was a good bash, but with more Poms than pomp.<br>I received a good conduct medal for being one of the few vultures of the press to promise not to take topless photos of Sophie. Indeed, I kept my shirt on the whole time.<br>A direct result of the good conduct medal was that it allowed me free passage to a couple of the mega sporting events that followed Ted and Sophie's nuptials. Unfortunately I could not stay for the prize piece of sport, the wedding of Posh Spice and David Beckham, because I had to rush home to tend to various sick and demented friends who still believe the Fremantle Shockers are a force in the AFL.<br>But I did get to go to the cricket World Cup final at Lord's and then to Wimbledon. At both events - because of the good conduct medal from the nuptials and all that and by a fair amount of sneaking in while backs were turned - I was able to attend press conferences with some of the world's sporting greats.<br>At Lord's I listened in as Pakistani captain Wasim Akram was quizzed about his side's capitulation to our brave Aussie lads.<br>Vulture of the press: Wasim, is it true you and your chaps had a wager of 400 million rupees on the Australians to win and that for the past three nights Pakistani cricketers have been whooping it up until all hours at nightclubs with painted floozies; and further, that you tampered with the ball, the sightscreen, the bats, the twelfth man and one of the member's memsahibs?<br>Wasim: I'm sick to the guts of questions like that, you illiterate droppings from a camel's nostril.<br>Steve Waugh then took the stage.<br>Australian press vulture: You're a bloody legend, mate.<br>Waugh: Strewth, thanks, and you can get off the floor now . . . and stop kissing my foot ya drongo. I'm sick to the guts of all this fawning adoration. Oh, sorry Mr Howard, I didn't recognise you.<br>The cricket was terrific and Wimbledon was almost as good. I eavesdropped on a few press conferences with players there, too.<br>Player minder: Gentlemen, may I present Miss Anna Kournikova of Russia who has just been beaten again in front of another record crowd?<br>Vultures of the press (in chorus): Phew, corr, whoaa, heyyy, show us your knickers then.<br>Miss Kournikova to minder: I'm sick to the guts of this. Can you get the serious tennis writers in here so we can have some sense?<br>Minder: These are the serious tennis writers miss . . . phew, corr, whoaa, heyyy etc.<br>Next cab off the rank was a knackered looking Patrick Rafter.<br>Vulture (probably Australian): You were almost a bloody legend, mate. How do you feel?<br>Rafter: I'm sick to the guts.<br>Vulture (possibly John Newcombe): You were great, Pat. We were all cheering for you. We're sick to the guts about what Agassi did to you, but no one watching TV in Australia would suspect you lost in straight sets, honest mate. You were beaut. Can I get you a drink?<br>I wanted to hang around for the finals on Sunday but as usual it was raining and the Poms had not thought about installing a roof over centre court ("by Jove, it's summer here you colonial ass?), so I decided to rush back to Melbourne and the MCG to watch Fremantle take on the patched-up, injury-stricken, pathetic rabble otherwise known as Essendon.<br>After the ritual slaughter of the lambs from the Port, I used my good conduct medal to listen in to Damian Drum's conference.<br>Vulture: Waddya reckon this time, Drummie?<br>Drum: It's all been said before.<br>(Warning: Some of the above may not be true.)<br></font></p>
