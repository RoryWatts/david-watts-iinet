            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF BRITISH Labour leader Tony Blair was a racehorse he would be a ?dead cert? to win the prime ministership in the general election on May 1.<br>The latest opinion polls have Mr Blair's party between 25 and 28 points ahead of John Major and his embattled Conservative Party.<br>Mr Major is battling allegations of corruption within Tory ranks, has had to manage crippling divisions on European policy, and still has to contend with interference from predecessor Margaret Thatcher.<br>He called the May 1 poll just over a week ago to give the Tories six weeks of campaigning aimed at finding Labour's and Mr Blair's weak spots. It has not gone well so far.<br>Followers of British politics have a wide variety of Web sites to choose from to follow what should be an historic election if Labour wins as expected.<br>Some of the best resources are at sites run by heavyweight UK newspapers. The Guardian, Times and Daily Telegraph all have special election sites. The Guardian's is easily the best.<br>Unlike the other two broadsheets, the paper does not simply echo its printed version on the Web.<br>Instead, it has developed a sometimes quirky site which not only picks the eyes out of its own excellent and often insightful print coverage, but also extends it to putting the election in a historical context.<br>It does this by running images of front pages from elections since Clement Attlee ousted Winston Churchill in 1945, and providing the news stories of the time.<br>Elsewhere both the Press Association - Britain's leading news service - and the influential and authoritative Economist magazine also provide good looks at main policies and players.<br>Both Labour and the Conservatives have well established sites.<br></font></p>
