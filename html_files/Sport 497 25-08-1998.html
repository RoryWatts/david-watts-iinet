            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FREMANTLE supporters deserve better.<br>I took the armchair to Subiaco to see first-hand whether the Dockers could perform like any normal AFL club that has just pushed aside its coach.<br>That is: show some pride and at least draw. Instead, the team decided to mark coach Gerard Neesham's Perth farewell match with one of its worst displays of bumbling ineptitude.<br>I ended up reading the Record during the last quarter, thus failing to give full credit to the Port Adelaide boys.<br>But it wasn't just that awful game.<br>On the Footy Show last Thursday, Sam Newman displayed all the sensitivity of a Cruise missile by declaring the Fremantle-Port game was being played for the Who Gives a Fat Rats cup.<br>It followed a string of trophies, starting with the Phil Narkle cup for the St Kilda-West Coast clash.<br>It was a cheap joke that got cheaper as it was repeated.<br>The climax was the Fat Rats trophy. Sure this was probably the ho-hum game on paper, and sure Newman was right that it would not be much of a contest (he did tip Fremantle, interestingly).<br>But his offhand dismissal of both teams was a low point, capping his effort the week before when he mocked both Fremantle and Port's team lists.<br>The Footy Show gives scant recognition that this is a national competition.<br>It gets away from its Melbourne base rarely. Its effort in Perth this year was indifferent, though the Adelaide show was one of the best with the great Peter Motley interview and the banter between Newman and Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja.<br>Newman is a one-off, unique entertainer with a gift for making football very funny.<br>Sources say a lot of his act is just that - an act.<br>But he can cross the bad taste boundary very quickly. That just doesn't mean blue jokes, but also mocking of players seemingly because they are not big names in Melbourne.<br>His worst effort was the ?who is Heath Black? episode in July. Dozens of people, and the talented Docker youngster himself, told him the answer in no uncertain terms during the western derby show.<br>Newman apparently learnt nothing from that. He has continued to belittle the unknowns. In some cases -- and the Dockers Sunday effort is a classic example -- those players have not done much to deserve better.<br>But anyone having a go in this competition deserves a bit of respect.<br>And the fans with the all-powerful remote controls do, too.<br></font></p>
