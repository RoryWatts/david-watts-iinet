            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WON'T it be good when February arrives? We will have something to complain about then. It is astonishing how quickly and easily many of us dissolve in a bit of El Nino-induced hot weather. The only lines of conversation are: ?Gee it's hot.? ?Yeah.?<br>But this week's griller conditions are a mere harbinger. February, as we all should remember, is where it's at. It is always a stinker.<br>Funnily enough, February is rotten the world over. In sub-tropical Brisbane it rains torrents, and when it doesn't it just feels like it because of the oppressive humidity. Ditto in Sydney . . . and that alleged paradise, Cairns.In Bali it pours; in Singapore the plants rot before your eyes with heat and humidity.<br>In Melbourne; well it's Melbourne and the weather is not to be trusted. Most Februaries there will produce a couple of days of a fierce north wind that will not only ignite the forests from Gippsland to the Dandenongs, but lift the hairpiece off your head and burn your dome.<br>In London it is miserable, grey and dark and cold with sleety rain and very occasionally sludgy snow. Same in New York and Paris. Moscow's under a tonne of ice, Los Angeles doubles its smog figure, everywhere is awful, waiting like a woman in her eighth month of pregnancy for the miracle of birth (spring) or welcome release (autumn).<br>One February evening - you could tell because the gloom had darkened - I was on a tube train in London surrounded by what looked like bundles of rags with eyes and hair. They, in fact, were just poor cold Londoners smelling of damp dog. Next to me was a lovely Hungarian man with whom I worked.<br>Like a good Aussie I started whingeing about the English February, but under his gentle inquisition admitted Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane et al were nothing special in February either.<br>I expected him to start extolling the virtues of a Budapest February, gleaming crisp and white in the late winter sun. But he said this: ?February. It is shocking, yes. Vy, in Budapesht, the schnow she is grey and melting, matching the sky. I hate February.?<br>AT LEAST the snow would be nice. In Perth you will find people becoming total zombies as they expose themselves to hours of muzak in air-conditioned shopping malls.Or they will subject themselves to four or five movies in a row just for a cool seat in a cinema complex.<br>Heat is relative of course. Yesterday we awaited a cool change with the temperature plummeting to 28C.<br>Once, in Ireland, the mercury did not get that far and everyone went stark, raving bonkers.<br>We were on the darling Dingle peninsula and it had hit 25C. And what's worse it was Sunday after Mass. Everyone headed for the beach. This was easy because the beach access was a long single-lane road flanked by high hedgerows. It was the only way people went.<br>On the beach, sure it was lovely. The sea sparkled, the waves danced like fairies in the lovely sun, the Dingleites - thousands of them - uncovered their pale bodies and mostly fair hair.<br>My Aussie family hid in the shade under layers of suncream and hats. The Dingleites liked the beach so much, they parked their cars on it, hundreds of them. They lazed about, splashing and swimming and pony riding and picnicking.<br>The tide, as it does, started to come in. No fear, the Dingleites began to reverse back to the road.<br>Many became bogged. Those who didn't had no room to go because the weight of traffic down that single lane had just formed a critical mass, all but impassable.<br>Amazingly the locals remained in good humour and started digging out the bogged and directing cars through millimetres of space so when it came time to leave everybody was able to head off, satisfied and sunstruck.<br>And it wasn't even February.<br></font></p>
