            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Industry, ALP, Democrats say move won't work<br>CANBERRA<br>THE Federal Government's crackdown on sex and violence on the Internet narrowly passed through the Senate yesterday.<br>After it is approved by the Lower House, new laws will take effect on January 1.<br>With the support of the two Independent senators, the extensively amended legislation passed the Senate, despite Labor and Australian Democrats complaints that it was not practical and would not work.<br>The new complaint-driven system gives the Australian Broadcasting Authority powers to regulate the Internet and to investigate prohibited material. It will be able to order service providers to remove prohibited material hosted on Australian computers and to take reasonable steps to block access to prohibited overseas sites.<br>Communications Minister Richard Alston said the Bill would help protect Australians, especially children, from illegal and highly offensive material.<br>Labor communications spokesman Stephen Smith said the Government was trying to claim the law would solve the problem of Internet pornography for parents but it would not. The only effective solution was to make sure parents understood the use of the Internet and the capacity of end filtering arrangements.<br>Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said she was not in favour of inappropriate material being available to minors but the Government's law was not the answer.<br>But Tasmanian Independent Brian Harradine said he was pleased with what he believed was a step in the right direction, although he wanted the law to go further.<br>Internet Industry Association executive director Peter Coroneos said the Government had made some amendments the industry had requested. The law had been dragged back from the brink of impossibility.<br>He said the requirement to block prohibited material from overseas had worried most service providers but the definition of taking reasonable steps meant they would not have to take action which was not technically or commercially feasible. ?We don't believe that there are any reasonable steps that can be taken,? he said.<br>The chairman of anti-censorship group Electronic Frontiers Australia, Kim Heitman, said the law would fail spectacularly and damage Australia's online economy in the process.<br>Paul McCutcheon, an executive member of the WA Internet Association, said the Bill would force billions of dollars of Australian money offshore as businesses avoided the Net here and logjams from censorship.<br>He said overseas creators of offensive content would step up efforts to beat Australia's censorship system. The Bill would then be responsible for making it easier for children to come across unwittingly the content it was meant to regulate.<br>Como ISP Mark Reynolds said censorship would slow down access to the Net.<br>BACKGROUND: New content laws<br>What will be unrestricted.<br>Material which would not be classified R or X or refused classification on video including:<br>Some nudity.<br>Discreetly implied or simulated sex.<br>Crude, but not sexually explicit language.<br>Some violence.<br>Drug use not advocating the use of illegal drugs.<br>What will be restricted to adults with age verification.<br>Material which would be classified R on video including:<br>Gratuitous or exploitative depictions of realistic violence or cruelty.<br>Detailed sexual violence or realistically simulated sexual activity.<br>What will be banned<br>Material which would be classified X or refused classification on video including:<br>Real depictions of actual sexual intercourse and other sexual activity.<br>Depiction of sexual violence, sexualised violence or coercion, or depictions which debase or abuse for the enjoyment of viewers.<br>Material which promotes or incites or instructs in crime and/or violence.<br>Detailed cruelty or real violence or with high impact.<br>Depictions of a child under 16 in a way which would offend a reasonable adult or depictions of child abuse.<br>Incest fantasies or other fantasies which are offensive or abhorrent.<br></font></p>
