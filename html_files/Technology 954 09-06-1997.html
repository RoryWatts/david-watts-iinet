            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A PERTH Internet site is offering people the chance to apologise personally to the stolen generation of Aborigines forcefully separated from their families.<br>Federal Government inaction and frustration with Prime Minister John Howard's muted personal apology prompted Perth man Anthony Shipley to create the site on the World Wide Web.<br>The site, Apology Australia, invites people to leave their name and e-mail address. A list of surnames can then be displayed, representing not only individual apologies but a collective one as well.<br>Mr Shipley hopes the site will attract many cyber-signatures. He would like it to remain on the Web as long as possible ?as a memorial to the suffering of the stolen generation so that this should never happen again?.<br>He believes that refusing to apologise for the trauma of having children taken away or of being separated from parents is uncharitable.<br>?The site is not about compensation,? he said. ?Largely, I want to focus on the apology without muddying the waters with party politics or the question of compensation.<br>?The stolen generation deserve an apology from the Australian people. I don't want to do anything that would put that at risk.<br>The Web address of Apology Australia is: http://apology.west.net.au/<br></font></p>
