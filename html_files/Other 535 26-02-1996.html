            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">OPPOSITION Leader John Howard's planned part sale of Telstra and the prospect of Alexander Downer as foreign affairs minister are the biggest talking points on Internet newsgroups.<br>The most talkative newsgroup in the campaign is aus.politics, which receives more than 100 postings a day on a wide variety of topics.<br>The newsgroup had been dominated by perhaps 10 men who appeared to favour conservative thinking. But in the past week, there has been more input from Labor supporters.<br>The discussion on Mr Howard's plan to spend $1 billion on the environment by selling a third of Telstra is the biggest issue.<br>The initial thread was that Mr Howard would have to blackmail Greens (WA) and Democrat senators to get Telstra sell-off legislation through.<br>One correspondent wrote: ?I am worried about the whole picture coming together. I see Howard promising to run a deficit to make good on middle-class welfare but no promise to make good on the environment if the Senate crossbenches don't support Telstra privatisation.?<br>Response: ?Why's that? Because you believe more in Telstra than the environment, obviously.?<br>The Downer as foreign affairs minister topic began with a Liberal supporter expressing concern.<br>Others agreed, fearing a repetition of Mr Downer's ?things that batter? statement at an international forum.<br>These fears gave way to speculation that Mr Downer was shadow foreign affairs minister only as a consolation for losing the party leadership and the portfolio would go to someone like Senate Opposition Leader Robert Hill if the coalition won.<br>After about 50 postings, the subject changed to a tipping competition on the election result - about 50-50 Labor-Liberal.<br></font></p>
