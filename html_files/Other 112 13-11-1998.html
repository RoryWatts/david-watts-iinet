            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PRINCE CHARLES opened his own site on the World Wide Web of the Internet this week. It may not have had much on the late Diana, Princess of Wales - shock, horror - but it did allow space for we common folk to speak our minds in HRH's virtual presence. I took the opportunity. After all it isn't every day that one has the chance to let it all hang out before a royal.<br>As a veteran of the Net, and wise in its arcane ways, I was able to discover Prince Charles's e-mail address and make my spiel all the more intimate.<br>Here is what I wrote to iamaprince@abigpalace.com:<br>Hi Chuck (we on the Net prefer informality)<br>Congratulations on your 50th birthday tomorrow. It occurred to me recently that we in Orstralya won't have the pleasure of your company on our stamps and banknotes even when you become King Charles III. You see, we are becoming a republic sooner or later, and given the longevity of the Windsor genes as apparent in your grandmother, your mum, the Queen, will be around a lot longer and we will have a president while you're still just a prince.<br>Sorry about that. It's nothing personal. You're not a bad bloke. Lots of interesting theories on organic farming and architecture as well as a jolly good sense of humour (I like the Goons too).<br>But to be blunt; what makes you a prince? Why should we treat you and your family as special? Who elected you? Isn't your place dictated by a fortunate accident of birth?<br>I know times have been tough. It must be a bore hearing everyone still going on about Diana. Your marriage seemed to be carried on in a public park with free admission. And now your liaison with Camilla Parker Bowles is suffering the same fate.<br>Not a moment's privacy.<br>But one has to expect that - especially after (at the age of four) you became Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick and Baron Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. By age 10 you had been made Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, and at 20 you were installed as a Knight of the Garter.<br>By age 20 I had a certificate for swimming the length of the pool and a mounted cricket ball for a seven-wicket haul in a colts match played on a sloping field where we had to chase a goat away from deep fine leg.<br>What's the difference between you and we commoners?<br>You've had a messy marriage and an affair. But they are kindergarten stuff compared to the shenanigans of some in your line of work.<br>Henry VIII lopped and chopped those wives he did not like. Edward II had a stable of perfumed male lovers. Charles II had so many lovers that it was said of him: ?A king is supposed to be the father of his people and Charles certainly was father to a good many of them.?<br>George II's queen hand-picked her husband's lovers, ensuring they were uglier than her.<br>Chuck, you're not that bad. But I think your days are numbered. Even your British subjects are cooling towards the idea of royal rule. Only 52 per cent told an ICM survey in August that Britain would be worse off without the monarchy. Until last year that figure had been 70 per cent.<br>Among 18-to-24-year-olds, support dropped from 64 per cent to 51 per cent in 12 months, doubtless because of the loss of Diana.<br>Sorry mate, but it looks like you are gradually becoming irrelevant. This Web site seems a desperate bid to get in touch with real people to find out what this royalty business means.<br>No wonder you look so sad in your recent photos.<br>Bye, and keep your chin up . . . watto@iinet.net.au.<br></font></p>
