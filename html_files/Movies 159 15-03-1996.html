            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">STOP me if you've seen this film. It goes like this. The hero is a divorced, macho detective ... the best on the force. But despite always solving cases brilliantly, the gruff, temperamental captain explodes every time he sees him and suspends him from duty.<br>The hero then tracks down the villain, a well-dressed foreigner with perfect teeth and even better English accent whose henchmen carry briefcases with either weapons or perfect rows of fresh banknotes.<br>The hero teams up with a feisty shoulder-pad wearing smart woman journalist, not a hair out of place, who initially can't stand the dinosaur-like machismo of the hero who drinks his whisky from a shot glass and always gets in a fight the minute he goes into a bar.<br>What she doesn't understand is that his best friend died in Vietnam just seconds after showing the hero a picture of his sweetheart.<br>The hero and the woman journalist fight continuously ... she even socks him one ... until one night they are pursued by the bad guys and she trips and sprains her ankle. He has to guide her to safety.<br>They fall rapturously in love, hit the bed together and make the most amazing love straight away, reaching mutual and simultaneous climax.<br>After, they lie with the sheets pulled up to her chin and his waist. Their cigarettes come from a packet whose brand name stares the camera right in the lens.<br>Then the bad guys capture the pair and tie them together in an abandoned building. The main villain sets a time bomb and we all know just how much time the hero has to defuse it, because, despite being thrown together in a hurry in a creepy warehouse, the bomb has a perfect LCD display showing the audience exactly how much time the hero has to untie himself and his girlfriend.<br>Fortunately their captors have botched the rope-tying and left the hero's hands just loose enough for him to reach a mirror in the journalist's handbag and use it to deflect the only rays of sunlight creeping into the building on to the rope and burn through it.<br>On escaping, the pair catch a conveniently- located and available lift (the only one that works), hop into a taxi that just happens to cruise past, pay the driver the exact fare and, despite their ordeal and still looking a million dollars, engage the baddies in gun play.<br>In the battle, the hero is outnumbered 50 to one but shoots everyone except the chief villain.<br>Bullets expended, the pair resort to swords. Just as the villain takes the upper hand, the hero pushes him down stairs, previously unseen, and the villain dies at the bottom a twisted wreck.<br>The hard hero and now doting journalist buy a dream house, somehow affording five bedrooms and Vogue furnishings despite the fact they are both out of work, make more perfect love, crack witty one-liners and live happily ever after.<br>Oh you've seen it, well bits of it.<br>It's the ultimate film, built on some of the ripest cliches around. But in terms of predictability it doesn't even scrape the surface.<br>All those cliches are on display on the Internet's World Wide Web at a site called The Movie Cliche List.<br>The site is run by an American, Giancarlo Cairella, who invites Net users to send in their favourite, or least liked ... in fact any ... cliches that they see on screen.<br>He has arranged collected cliches under 72 headings, but warns he is still assembling them from a huge backlog.<br>Categories include alcohol, aliens, helicopters, kids, middle ages (the evil king always has all his gold in a cart when he rides through the bandit-infested forest and that cart will be the only one that gets stuck in the gentle stream), pregnancy, prison, teenagers (they have every square centimetre of their messy but elegantly trendy bedroom covered in the latest posters), villains, war and wood (it never hurts when it is smashed over a hero's head).<br></font></p>
