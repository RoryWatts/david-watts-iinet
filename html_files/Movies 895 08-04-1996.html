            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>The Indian in the Cupboard (G)<br>Hal Scardino, Litefoot<br>Directed by Frank Oz<br>PARENTS who see The Indian in the Cupboard will wish for the magic key to the magic cupboard so they can turn their chocolate egg-infested darlings into plastic toys for a spell.<br>The cupboard is the centrepiece of this thoughtful and intense children's film which lacks ninja fights, cute or scary animals (oh, there is a rat) and evil villains.<br>Without those elements it still manages to keep children on the edge of their seats for most of its 96 minutes.<br>The magic cupboard is a birthday present for the nerdish nine-year-old hero Omri (Hal Scardino). With the help of an old key, Omri finds that a plastic toy locked in the cupboard will turn into a real person - a very small person - when the cupboard is unlocked.<br>The first ?victim? is an Iroquois warrior called Little Bear (Litefoot) who is rightfully tremulous about life with a giant nine-year-old he calls the Great Spirit.<br>Indeed the ability to transform toys into people is almost too much for Omri and he tries to play God by transforming everything he owns.<br>That turns nasty when Darth Vader fences with a T-rex and Robocop fends off a brace of baddies, turning Omri's cupboard into a war zone.<br>So this nine-year-old - unlike most boys his age - starts to become a responsible person, like an adult with a baby. Omri's baby is Little Bear, who not only has to come to terms with being only about 10cm tall, but also with the fact he no longer is fighting for the British against the French in 1761.<br>The fly in the ointment is Omri's best friend Patrick, who, once in on the secret, wants to let the cupboard do its magic all the time. Omri warns him of the consequences but to no avail and pretty soon Little Bear has an ?amigo?, a drunken cowboy called Boone from the late 19th century (a terrific little performance by David Keith) and his wayward horse.<br>For the first time in the film there is conflict and tension as the cowboy and Indian fight like ... cowboys and Indians.<br>Up to this stage, The Indian in the Cupboard is in danger of snoozing away. But the dramatic interplay allows a lot of growing up and learning which is the base of the film's charm.<br>There is more tension as Omri and Patrick try to keep the secret of the cupboard's magic. The parents seem oblivious to the shooting and hoofbeats in the bedroom, as well as the little hunting parties in the backyard (Omri turns one of his plastic deer loose so Little Bear can use the bow and arrow filched from an elderly plastic indian).<br>These outdoor scenes are a real poor man's Honey I Shrunk the Kids. In fact the overall special effects are ordinary, yet in keeping with the film's simple, understated style.<br>Director Frank Oz has restrained himself so there is no scary music or special light shows when toys transform. At times the restraint makes for dreariness which turns Indian into a less-than-riveting history lesson.<br>Smaller children might be bored, but the older pre and early teens could certainly learn some lessons.<br></font></p>
