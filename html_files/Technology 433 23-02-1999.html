            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FAMILY<br>Relate<br>www.relate.gov.au/home.html<br>THE Federal Government aptly chose Valentine's Day to launch this site which aims to encourage couples to do more to improve their relationships.<br>The Relate site provides information on marriage and relationship education services run by 46 community organisations approved and funded by the Federal Government.<br>The services have been chosen because they offer information and skills to help improve relationships. Getting around and finding information is easy because Relate is a no-frills, mainly text site.<br>For example, the search feature allows users to choose an area of relationships they would like help in, the State and even whether they want to confine their search to capital cities.<br>One click and they are shown a list of links to appropriate courses with e-mail feedback provided.<br>FILM<br>Shakespeare in Love<br>www.miramax.com:8888/ows-doc/<br>shakespeareinlov/index.html<br>TO SURF or not to surf - many movies have their own sites. Often the site is far better than the film. But in this case the celluloid version wins hands down. The problem can be seen at once in the long URL needed to find out about Shakespeare in Love. But quibbles aside, you can play video footage from the film, listen to some of the music and read brief bon mots about the cast and production.<br>TV<br>Former Child Star Central<br>members.tripod.com/~former-child-star/<br>IT IS hard to think what some people did with their time before the Web became popular. Take Scooter Nelson, creator of this site, for example.<br>His interest is the child stars of TV in the 60s, 70s and 80s. He takes e-mail sightings of the precocious brats-grown-old and publishes them here, occasionally adding his own comments to clarify matters. There is news, pictures and links as well, but the e-mail sightings are the highlight.<br>Like this one on Butch Patrick, who played Eddie in the Munsters: ?A couple of years ago I was leaving a grocery store and happened to glance at the community cork board. There was a flyer announcing that Butch Patrick would be performing at one of the community centres. He was doing a comedy routine involving puppets.?<br>Hold page one ...<br>?Readers' suggestions for Web Sights are welcome. E-mail: watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
