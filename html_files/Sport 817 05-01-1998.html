            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WAS always going to end in tears. Two top Australian sportsmen into one TV just does not go.<br>Pat Rafter was fading curiously in the second set of his Hopman Cup singles against Thomas Enqvist on the ABC. Meanwhile, I had assumed that Steve Waugh in his 100th Test was doggedly prodding away to 100 against South Africa on Nine.<br>Biting my tongue at the top-knotted, top-notch Rafter and his ability to make Enqvist look brilliant, I switched to Nine, sensing that Waugh - who I'd left looking composed in his 70s - must be nearing the ton. This would be a feat to equal Colin Cowdrey and Gordon Greenidge in their 100th Tests.<br>There was Ponting, dashing closer to 50. And at the other end ... Michael Bevan.<br>Rot Rafter's socks and the ABC's coverage from Burswood. The temptation of seeing the man alleged to be the sexiest athlete on the planet had proved too much and I had missed ?Tugger? being bowled comprehensively for 85. In the process, I had had the pleasure of hearing the comforting voice of Fred Stolle.<br>Australians like Stolle love their home-grown champions. Over at the cricket, Richie Benaud and Ian Chappell showed that love of country is not confined to the tennis set.<br>They took viewers on a tour of the Sydney Cricket Ground's stands. They rhapsodised, quite rightly too, about Sir Don Bradman, Monty Noble, Bill O'Reilly and Doug Walters, and even gave the great rugby league fullback Clive Churchill his due. If you are not Australian you do not have to read on, but the year just passed was one worth much chest-beating for sports lovers. Let's look:<br>?Rafter ended as the No.2 player in the world to Pete Sampras. Mark Philippoussis was 18th.<br>?Australia topped the table in Test cricket, according to Wisden's Test match championship rankings. Mark Taylor's men's win-loss-draw ratio easily beat South Africa, then West Indies, then India and Pakistan which were tied for fourth. Waugh finished second behind Pakistan's Inzamam-ul-Haq in the Coopers & Lybrand ratings for batsmen. Glenn McGrath topped the bowling. Shane Warne was fifth and Paul Reiffel eighth.<br>?Greg Norman finished on top of the golf rankings from Tiger Woods. Karrie Webb was the second-ranked woman golfer.<br>?In women's squash we had numbers one, two and five with Sarah Fitz-Gerald, Michelle Martin and Carol Owens. Rodney Eyles was the No. 4 man. No one got seriously near Michael Doohan in the 500cc motorcycle championship.<br>? The rugby union Wallabies had one of their ordinary years, yet finished fourth behind New Zealand, South Africa and France.<br>? Cathy Freeman was world champion at 400m, our hockey players were wonderful as always, our triathletes and surfers set the standard and the Socceroos were rated 35th in the world by soccer's peak body, FIFA.<br>And next week at Challenge Stadium ... we armchair barrackers will be waving the flag.<br></font></p>
