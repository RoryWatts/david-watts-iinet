            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">USERS appear evenly split in the browser war but computer reviewers are more inclined to praise Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>The praise is for Microsoft's achievement in catching up to Netscape in one year, matching and in some cases beating the technology that has revolutionised Internet use.<br>A troll through Perth newsgroups and the global alt.windows95 found these two user statements to be fairly representative of the pros and cons of the browsers.<br>?I find the (MS Internet Explorer) mail and news clients far too basic and I'm still unconvinced that it is a better browser than Netscape - especially in the Gold version which allows editing of Web pages,? one says.<br>In the Explorer corner: ?I just wanted everyone to know that IE 3.0 is way better than Netscape. Netscape always gives me a bunch of illegal operations.<br>?With IE, you can specify fonts in your Web page, turn the underline off links, change the size of the font while browsing, see ActiveX and Visual Basic programs, as well as Java, Frames, Floating Frames, and much more.?<br>At the prominent Internet site run by cnet, reviewer Rex Baldazo waxed lyrical about Internet Explorer.<br>?Microsoft did it. Internet Explorer 3.0 matches nearly all the features you've grown to love in Netscape Navigator.<br>?By adding some interesting new technologies of its own - and a promotional offer that delivers $400 worth of free access to Net content - Microsoft has made Internet Explorer 3.0 a great choice for people running Windows 95 or Windows NT,? Mr Baldazo wrote.<br>?Nobody runs Java better. IE 3.0 remains the fastest Windows Java engine we've tested. IE 3.0 supports more of the HTML 3.2 standard than Netscape does, including style sheets.?<br>Baldazo appeared less enthusiastic about Netscape Navigator.<br>?Not much has changed since our first look at what was then code-named Netscape Navigator Atlas. Navigator 3.0 is a good upgrade to a great product,? he wrote.<br>He rightly praised Navigator's improved mail and news features, which are a highlight of the program.<br>PC Week magazine said Explorer was equal to or better than Navigator in almost every respect. InfoWorld Electric Review said Explorer was easier and more enjoyable to use than any browser tested.<br>Users can see what each browser offers at these pages:<br>Microsoft Internet Explorer: www.microsoft.com/ie/<br>Netscape Navigator: home.nets<br>cape.com/comprod/tour/nav3/<br>tour-home.html<br></font></p>
