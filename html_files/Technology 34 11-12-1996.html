            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Space Jam (G)<br>Bugs Bunny, Michael Jordan<br>Directed by Joe Pytka<br>IF YOU want to immerse yourself in junk culture go no further than Space Jam, a film that seems designed solely to market unnecessary goods.<br>Two icons of America's consume-at-all-costs culture, basketball legend Michael Jordan and cartoon favourite Bugs Bunny, front a mindless piece of mayhem that will have children demanding anything with the stars' pictures or names on them.<br>Space Jam mixes animation and real life as did Disney with Mary Poppins and Amblin with Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But unlike those two creative and funny works, Keith Gordon's mix is a mess of too-vivid colour and over-the-top craziness.<br>There are a few things to recommend. Action shots of the amazing Jordan, many in super slow-motion, show what an artist he is.<br>And some of the one-liners from Bugs, Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Tweetie Pie and crew are precious. For example, when discussing team names, Daffy rules out Ducks as being too Micky Mouse (The Mighty Ducks was a Disney film).<br>But overall, Jordan is no actor, though he is far from awful. And the Looney Tunes characters are no basketballers.<br>This is what the comic-strip script is all about of course. An alien planet, populated by cartoon characters and presided over by creepy boss, Swackhammer (the voice of Danny DeVito), needs a new attraction for its theme park. The present one is hopeless. With attractions like Moron Mountain, that is not surprising.<br>Swackhammer sends some little goons to Earth, where they suck the playing talents out of NBA stars including Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson. Each hams it up up worse than his predecessor as the aliens cripple America's own sport.<br>Meanwhile, Michael Jordan is failing at his much publicised attempt to be a baseballer. He fails in style; even teammates say he looks great when he strikes out.<br>The aliens have infiltrated Tune world - home of Bugs and crew - challenged the inhabitants to basketball and in the process mutated into huge, hulking monsters (their team is called the Monstars).<br>The stakes are high. If the Monstars beat the Looney Tune team then Bugs, Daffy and friends will be the stars at Swackhammer's theme park.<br>Bugs comes up with the plan to enlist Jordan's help. The rest is predictable with some moments of fun. It is punctuated with loud noise, yelling, screaming and dreadful music - rap; the type with a silent C.<br>Funnyman Bill Murray chimes in to help Jordan and Bugs and there is a new love interest with the introduction of Lola Bunny - but she's not a patch on Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.<br>Space Jam has had very favourable reviews in the US; predictably Chicago, where Jordan is God-like.<br>It is an unashamed commercial for America's lowest form of culture. But children who like McDonalds, yo-yos, back-to-front baseball caps and loud music will probably love it.<br></font></p>
