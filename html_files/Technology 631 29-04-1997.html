            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE biggest buzzword on the Internet now is push technology. World Wide Web surfers are not the ones shouting it, however.<br>The noise is coming from software makers and commercial content developers who finally sense a way to make money from the hugely popular medium.<br>At the moment the bulk of Web use is concerned with browsing from site to site. A user can spend a fairly fruitless hour on the Web, with slow connection times and general congestion causing frustration.<br>Commercial content providers who want their sites visited by as many as possible feel that frustration too, as do advertisers who might have paid to put banners at various sites.<br>The principle of push technology is to ?push? that content and those ads to the user. This is done through programs like PointCast News, the most popular at the moment, which can be configured to hunt for certain Web pages and load them on the user's hard disk. This means those pages, which can contain HTML, video, audio and Java applets, can then be read offline at considerable speed.<br>In reality push should more correctly be called pull. These programs are, after all, pulling the content off the Web on to users' systems.<br>Push systems are not widespread at the moment, but the next generation of browsers, Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Communicator, will rely heavily on them.<br>Unfortunately the browser giants are going separate ways in developing their push technologies, causing concern that the Web will be split into two incompatible camps.<br>Microsoft has developed a Channel Definition Format which will allow Explorer users to subscribe to sites which the browser will hunt automatically and drag down to the user's desktop and hard drive.<br>Netscape will come to market in June with Netcaster using the resources of the new, powerful Marimba Castanet push system. It is not compatible with nor does it follow the same standards as CDF.<br>Raphael Needleman, the editor of CNET.COM, a big US Web publisher, warned last week that the rush to push technology endangered ordinary users' desktops - the site where newer programs will dump Web content.<br>?I haven't heard a hue and cry from the Web-browsing public for sites that take over the desktop,? Needleman said. ?As far as I know, there's no group of people lobbying CNN and CNET to put their sites on the desktop.?<br>He was touching on the main problem of push technology. It turns the free many-to-many broadcast nature of the Web into a medium more resembling TV or radio; that is a one-to-many broadcast system.<br>If you install PointCast News for example, then the whole Web experience can be dominated by CNN and Ziff Davis, the technology publishing company. PointCast can be programmed to look for the latest news, sport, entertainment, lifestyle and technology news. It returns specially prepared sites quickly to the user's computer, but all the news comes from just these two sources.<br>It is also heavily US-oriented. A Net user may as well put a baseball cap on backwards, turn on the NBA on TV and tuck into a Big Mac.<br>The excellence of the Web in transcending the so-called Coca-colonisation of culture could take a serious backward step if push technology is allowed to develop unhindered on the current American path.<br>That is not to say it doesn't have good points. Indeed it has many.<br>Many people can use a news ticker on their computer at all times, although updated sports scores and stock quotes would be more relevant if they were Australian.<br>Companies might also see the benefit of controlling employees' desktops on an intranet.<br></font></p>
