            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS column was originally going to be about the places to find Posh Spice - and news of her pregnancy - on the World Wide Web.<br>However, by typing the words Posh Spice into the search field of the aptly-named HotBot Web tool, a cesspit of adult sites offering nude pictures of the Tory Party's favourite Spice girl presented itself.<br>On closer inspection, these sites might or might not have shown Posh in the nude. One needed to register and give credit card details to plough further into the mire.<br>Such is cyberspace. But the words Don Bradman produced no such grotty results. The great man turned 90 yesterday and every form of media has been churning out well earned tributes.<br>The Internet is no different. Yes, the Net offers plenty of smut like the Posh Spice sites, but it also treats the legends of life with reverence.<br>The best place to view the Don in all his greatness is served up by the State Library of South Australia at its Don Bradman Collection, an on-line display complementing the museum's real-life collection of the Test cricketing master's memorabilia.<br>The site welcomes Web surfers with the quote: ?It is strange, but I think true, that all the time, day and night, somewhere in the world somebody is talking about Bradman.?<br>Those words were written almost 60 years ago by English sportswriter Jack Ingham.<br>And as the welcome page says: ?To this day nothing has changed. The legend of Sir Donald Bradman will live on as long as sport is played.?Now with Bradman the Legend available on the World Wide Web all the time, day and night, more people than ever before are talking about Bradman, all over the world.?<br>Cricket purists might argue forever that there were more stylish batsmen than Sir Donald.<br>The names of Hobbs, Woolley and Ranji are always bandied about by English critics.<br>Archie Jackson and Victor Trumper are the Australian side to the style debate. Sir Garfield Sobers is spoken of as the greatest all-round cricketer of all time.<br>But there is no argument about the way Sir Donald's ruthless accumulation of runs dominated his sport.<br>The Collection Web site has a special page devoted to this fact, showing what acknowledged champions in other sports would need to have done to compare with Sir Donald.Basketballer Michael Jordan would have had to have scored 65 points a game.Gymnast Nadia Comaneci would have had to have recorded perfect 10s in four straight Olympics.Baseball's Babe Ruth would have to had hit 300 more home runs than he did.<br>The site has many pictures of Sir Donald from childhood to recent times, along with soundtracks of his views on the game that can be played simply by clicking on links.<br>His welter of records is there as well as all the important statistics of a career that ended with the most famous batting average of them all - 99.94.<br>Those with a penchant for Australian sporting heroes might also like to check out a more contemporary one - tennis star and teen heart-throb Patrick Rafter.<br>The affable Queenslander - who lives in Bermuda - is defending his US Open title from next Monday.<br>The Web has a site compiled by the Official Patrick Rafter Supporters' Club which brims with information from his height, weight, love of chocolate and The Simpsons right through to his recent good run of tournament victories.<br>And it has good pictures and caricatures of the man who sent WA women into a swoon when he removed his shirt courtside at this year's Hopman Cup.<br>The sites:<br>Don Bradman Collection:<br>www.bradman.sa.com.au<br>Pat Rafter Supporters:<br>www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/<br>1204/index.html<br>Posh Spice Fan Club:<br>friko2.onet.pl/to/posh/<br></font></p>
