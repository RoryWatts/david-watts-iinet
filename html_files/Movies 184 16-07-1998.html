            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS<br>Terry Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's classic of gonzo journalism has arrived trailing some of the worst reviews in recent times. ?Fear and Loathing is a horrible mess of a movie, without shape, trajectory of purpose,? dismissed one critic. Another said it's ?a long offensive treatise on just how offensive two human beings can be'. But, considering the source material, is this extreme response so surprising? How can any movie set in the early 1970s about a journalist (Johnny Depp) and his hugely overweight Samoan lawyer (Benicio Del Torro) who are distracted from their task of covering a motorcycle race in Las Vegas by a trunkful of drugs - grass, mescaline, acid, cocaine, uppers, booze, ether - be anything but controversial in the more conservative 1990s? Apparently the remarkable Gilliam (The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys) has done a wonderful job transferring Thompson's hallucinatory imagery to the screen. ?Fear and Loathing is the closest sensory approximation of an acid trip ever achieved in a mainstream movie,? noted one critic. But is this what anyone wants to see in a world in which drugs are no longer hip but the destroyer of countless lives? At the Luna. Rated R (not previewed)<br>THE APOSTLE<br>NNNNN<br>In a Hollywood whose idea of a character flaw is uncapped teeth and cellulite-ingrained thighs we must fall to our knees and give thanks and praise for Robert Duvall's Sonny Dewey, a Texas Pentecostal preacher with ?a wandering eye and wickie-wickie ways?. Sonny's struggle to redeem himself, which involves building a church in an impoverished Louisiana town, makes for perhaps the year's finest film, a deeply compassionate, powerfully acted drama - Duvall arguably gives his best performance to date - about a simple, God-fearing folk who are normally ridiculed by the movie industry. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>CRACKERS<br>NN½<br>It was bound to happen - another Ocker comedy that aspires to be the lovably ugly twin to The Castle. Unfortunately, Crackers writer-director David Swann is way too ambitious for his own good, yanking from one end of the taste and sensibility spectrum to the other this story about several generations of the dreadful Dredge family coming together for Christmas. Occasionally, there is a gleeful dagginess to some of the gags, usually perpetrated by the Bart Simpson-like Joey. But Swann doesn't know how to mesh the crude, rude, funny bits with the skew-wiff attempt to say something meaningful. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>DR DOLITTLE<br>NNN½<br>Forget the anal humour and the shameless exploitation of cute children and what you have is a funny and enjoyable very 90s updating of the classic tale about a doctor with a talent for talking to animals. Eddie Murphy gives a surprisingly straight performance in the title role, allowing the humour to bounce off him rather than hamming it up as he sometimes does. And the animals are terrific - not cute and fuzzy but bristling with attitude, funny lines and cynicism, especially the tiger with a chronic headache. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>GREASE<br>NNN½<br>It's a little hard to take seriously a musical in which the ?teen? stars were all pushing 30 (Stockard Channing was in fact 34). But the inappropriate casting is part of the campy appeal of Grease, with director Randall Kleiser injecting huge energy and devil-may-care high spirits in bringing the hit stage show to the screen. Sure, it's a TV perennial but colour and movement, great songs and spicy humour (especially from movie-stealing Channing as the tarty Rizzo) can only really be appreciated on wide-screen with its digitally remastered soundtrack. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>Cinematheque<br>FRITZ LANG RETROSPECTIVE<br>Citizen Kane has long been regarded as the greatest film. It made film noir so commonplace that it is spoofed in sitcoms. But does anyone ever remember the origins of Orson Welles' elegantly off-kilter, visual style or the gloomy fatalism of all those detective movies? It can all be traced to German Expressionism and the directors who took the style to Hollywood when the nazis rose to power. The key figure is Fritz Lang, who created Expressionistic masterpieces in Germany before the war (Metropolis, M) then helped to turn film noir into a dominant, artistically ambitious genre in Hollywood in the 1940s and 50s with films that established him such as Ministry of Fear. These three great movies, plus the social realist drama You and Me (with music by Kurt Weill), make up the Cinematheque's mini-retrospective over the next two Saturdays.
