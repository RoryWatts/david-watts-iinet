            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TRYING to predict the future is a mugs' game. If you are reading this on Tuesday morning can you be sure that Rogan Josh - or whatever your tip might be - is going to make you slightly richer by winning today's Melbourne Cup?<br>And will you wake up a different person next week if the Yes vote succeeds at Saturday's republic referendum?<br>They are immediate events, so imagine the difficulty in saying with any certainty what changes digital television will make to our lives by 2008.<br>By that time Australia will be receiving all its TV in digital format. It is an eternity in terms of technological change.<br>Who, for example, would have dreamt nine years ago that 30 per cent of Australians would be sitting at computers and taking part in the global phenomenon of the Internet?<br>What we can divine from the statements of Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston, the man charged with plotting the introduction of digital television, and by the Government's legislation, is that we seem set for a conservative time.<br>For a start, Senator Alston favours high-definition digital which has been criticised as yuppie TV because the sets required to receive the cinema-quality picture cost at least twice as much as those needed to see the lesser-quality standard format.<br>And the Government has virtually locked out anyone but present commercial networks from providing datacasting services on TV.<br>Until Senator Alston makes another announcement we have to assume that the ABC, SBS and channels 7, 9 and 10 are likely to be the providers allowed to use digital TV to showcase their Internet services.<br>With the possible exception of SBS, all these networks appear ready to spread their influence.<br>Nine, through its ninemsn site, and the ABC are already favourites of Australian Web surfers. The latest Where Did We Go survey ranks ninemsn as the third most visited Australian site, and the ABC as the fourth.<br>NINE has fluctuated in the list of 100 sites between second and third almost every week since its debut at number 19 in November 1997. The ABC has had a mortgage on a top five spot for nearly three years.<br>Seven, after strong rankings in the teens in 1997 and 98, is now at number 53, while Ten is at 68. The ABC and ninemsn are rich in content with links to every facet of their organisations' operations.<br>Ten and Seven are simpler sites specialising in highlighting aspects of their networks.<br>All thrive on presenting up-to-the-minute news ... and all except the ABC take the Web surfer to nowhere more interesting than the empires of their creators.<br>So datacasting by the present networks offers the image of interactivity without disturbing the status quo of TV land.<br>If you can get a handle on the future, then it's a case of evolution not revolution.<br>HELP DESK<br>Where Did We Go:<br>usrwww.mpx.com.au/~ianw/<br>Nine: ninemsn.com.au<br>ABC: www.abc.net.au<br>Seven: www.seven.com.au<br>Ten: www.ten.com.au<br></font></p>
