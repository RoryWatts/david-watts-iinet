            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET users have applauded the move of Matt Drudge - the world's highest-profile online journalist - to the more traditional medium of radio.<br>Drudge, 32, the man who broke the Monica Lewinsky story, has signed a deal with US company ABC Radio Networks to do a weekly talk show.<br>Drudge, who first posted the Lewinsky sex allegations on his Web site in January 1998, will host a two-hour topical commentary and listener call-in show. His ABC salary is said to be in six figures.<br>According to a report in the London online edition of the Guardian, the deal was reached only over the strenuous objections of the head of the ABC news division, David Westin.<br>Mr Westin was reported to have depicted Drudge as a loose cannon already facing a $50 million libel suit for falsely accusing a White House aide, Sydney Blumenthal, of beating his wife - a claim Drudge quickly retracted.<br>Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post's media correspondent, said the ABC deal saw ?the further blurring of the news and entertainment cultures. What's fascinating is that a rebel and an outsider armed with nothing more than a modem can break into this rather exclusive club.?<br>But the majority of Net users, who joined a BBC e-mail forum about Drudge's move, welcomed the fact that Drudge's style of gossip-cum-news had been accepted in the so-called real world.<br>Among the many comments from around the world were:<br>? ?He is a genuine, honest, journalist. The only one I've seen who does his homework.?<br>??Drudge breaks stories before the mainstream media do, if they mention it at all.?<br>??Hardly a gossip monger, I find the Drudge Report to be cutting-edge journalism. More often than not, he is the first to report news that eventually (and often begrudgingly) comes out on television and radio news.?<br>? ?When will the established media realise, "the times, they are a changing'. We now live in microwave times. As network TV gave way to cable, newspapers will give way to the Internet.?<br>??America needs more men like Drudge. Stand up and "tell it like it is'.?<br>Drudge's Web site, called the Drudge Report, is extremely popular. It claims to have had more than 20 million visits from Web surfers in the past month.<br>Little of its content is created by Drudge himself. His often pithy - and sensational - daily column represents a tiny percentage of the material presented. Instead, Drudge operates a global media village with dozens of links to wire services, newspapers, radio stations, television news and emerging Net-only news services.<br>Drudge says he culls his report from 35 daily newspapers, wire services and more than 1000 daily e-mail tips. Recently his style of online reporting was described as being on the cutting edge of a revolution in journalism.<br>Last month, Drudge earned the right to address the National Press Club in Washington. It seems his often-entertaining responses to accusations of rumour-mongering and sensationalism were well received by the mainstream media.<br>Help desk:<br>The Drudge Report: www.drudgereport.com<br>Address to the Washington Press Club: www.frontpagemag.com/archives/drudge/drudge.htm<br></font></p>
