            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Murder in the First (MA)<br>Christian Slater, Kevin Bacon,<br>Gary Oldman<br>Directed by Marc Rocco<br>MURDER in the First is a prison-courtroom drama built on the firm foundations of cinematic cliches.<br>The prisoner and long-lost sister touch hands on the glass dividing them in the jail visiting cubicle; the guards pray to God or sing Christmas Carols then in the next frame beat prisoners mercilessly; a young lawyer in his first case takes on every power you can imagine ... and so on.<br>The list goes on but not the least of good cinematic cliches is the one that cruel people sometimes say of journalists: ?Never let the facts get in the way of a good story.?<br>Murder in the First, set in San Francisco in the 1940s, is based on the true story of prisoner Henri Young who killed a fellow inmate. At his trial it was found he had been so brutally tortured in Alcatraz by the guards and the prison system, that he was not responsible for his actions.<br>This is the way the film story by Dan Gordon and director Marc Rocco tells it: Orphan Young (Kevin Bacon) is jailed at age 17 for stealing $5 to feed his little sister during the Depression.<br>He is taken to Alcatraz to help fill empty cells and in 1938 tries to escape this ?devil's island? with three others. No one gets away.<br>Young is sent to solitary - a tiny, totally dark and slimy dungeon - where the assistant warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and the guards beat him and torture him for three years. He is let out for 30 minutes every Christmas Day.<br>On his release from this so-called rehabilitation he stabs a prisoner he suspects of betraying him in the neck with a spoon. The grisly murder in the Alcatraz dining room is witnessed by 200 people.<br>But this is the real story, according to US Bureau of Prisons: Young was a bank robber who brutalised a hostage and also a murderer well before he killed his fellow inmate.<br>He was not in a dungeon for three years, but in solitary in a normal cell for a little over a year.<br>He killed the other prisoner in the Alcatraz workshop with a knife.<br>No matter the difference between truth and film, Young's story and the media circus surrounding his trial are good, honest cinema.<br>It is a simple dramatic story powerfully told with grim locations and good acting.<br>The prison brutality that leaves Young a shambling, monosyllabic beast of a man is taken as a cause celebre by public defender James Stamphill (Christian Slater), who the film would have us believe invented courtroom media circuses.<br>The strange friendship that develops between Young and Stamphill is the major thrust of the narrative.<br>Murder in the First is eminently watchable for this interaction between Young and Stamphill. Cameras are often hand-held or at funny angles from the floor or ceiling to heighten the drama.<br>The fact that there never was a young defender named Stamphill - Young was defended by a team - means nothing.<br>Slater, an actor I've never had time for, gives an excellent performance and if you close your eyes to little slits you might believe it's Kevin Costner up there.<br>Bacon is good too; taking on the histrionics and barking dog madness of Young with gusto. The Apollo 13 star shed 10kg for this role and endured hours of make-up to look filthy, tortured and emaciated.<br>It doesn't quite work because as he lies shivering and speaking in scribble in the dungeon, there is no way to hide the fact that Bacon has excellent muscle tone.<br>His flesh should have been hanging from his bones like an elephant's behind if he had been so physically deprived for three years.<br>And Oldman as a well-intentioned sadist is excellent. He grows in stature with each film and obviously likes playing people with a few kangaroos loose in the top paddock.<br></font></p>
