            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It's fascinating to watch children using a computer to learn.<br>Fogies in their 40s like myself can learn a lot about the learning process even if we think we know it all.<br>People of my generation learnt in mostly structured, linear fashion. The most obvious example of this is the reference book. Look up the index, find the page, go to the subject and read about it.<br>Much of the Web is like that, as are reference works on CD-ROM such as Microsoft Encarta and the Encyclopedia Britannica. The exciting edge the Web and the CDs give is the multimedia experience.<br>In its simplest form, that means you can see video footage of the history of the Berlin Wall while reading about Germany on MS Encarta, for example.<br>But what some computer programs can now give children or anyone wanting to learn is a spatial experience.<br>This is best illustrated by the 3D flythrough. The user's screen is a virtual environment, like a zoo or room, and movement of the cursor is akin to walking around that area.<br>Key hot spots or hyperlinks in that space can be clicked on to alter the view, deliver textual information or play multimedia.<br>Learning becomes a more active pursuit where the student is in charge of the agenda. Or seemingly in charge. Someone else, presumably an educator, had to set up the flythrough program and its educational highlights in the first place.<br>The easy acceptance of flythrough learning on-screen became obvious to me when I took two educationalCD-ROMs home for my own children, an 11-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy.<br>I expected they would find it easier to use DK Multimedia's The Way Things Work 2. After all, it was colourful and neatly set out as well as being simple to follow.If you wanted to learn how a video recorder worked, you just clicked on an image of it.<br>But this was arrogance and ignorance from an old buffer. I found it simple, colourful and easy to use. They preferred the complicated-looking (to me) interface of DK's Dinosaur Hunters.<br>It gave only a rough idea of how to find information and graphics about the prehistoric reptiles, but the kids cottoned on straight away and enjoyed finding their own way around the virtual zoo the dinosaurs were kept in.<br>So they made mistakes. But each one led to something fascinating and the back key could get them out of trouble.<br>Similar things happened while introducing them to the Net. One of the better teaching programs around is Internet Coach for Netscape Navigator.It was developed to show US President Bill Clinton and key White House staff how to use the Net.<br>And it is simple and effective with a very easy interface to guide users through the intricacies of FTP, e-mail, plug-ins, Java, etc.<br>As a straightforward teaching tool, it is hard to beat ? I thought.<br>Then I tried the kids and myself on Mission to Planet X, an interactive guide to the Net from APTE, the US company also responsible for Internet Coach.<br>Mission is designed to teach kids aged nine and up how the Net works. Well, it does, eventually. Along the way it is also good fun because it does not sit there and just point at the blackboard, so to speak.<br>It sets the student a mission which when undertaken shows them a part of the Net and explains its functions.<br>To get to another part of the Net or to delve deeper into a mission the user has to play and win a fairly, challenging interactive game that usually involves memory skills.(Well, I thought they were challenging; my eight-year-old knocked them off in no time).<br>Current interfaces to the Web are fairly linear and right in line with the way their creators learnt logical and linear.<br>But don't be surprised if there are massive changes within 10 years. Early evidence is out already that spatial viewing and navigating is on the way. For those with Windows 95 or NT, one of the best ways to get a taste is to download the PerspectaView browser.<br>This works a little like the human brain, enabling users to cruise from site to site while keeping other related sites in view.If you see a site that interests you, move your cursor to it and it branches out like a tree showing related topics, which in turn may have branches of their own.<br>Move back and the branches disappear but you are suddenly in a new forest of links.<br>It is as fascinating as the learning process itself.See next week's edition of Access for a round-up of some of the latest educational/edutainment software titles.<br>HELP DESK<br>CSIRO: www.publish.csiro.au/cyberscience/multimedia/<br>ILCIABW.htm<br>Dataworks: www.dataworks.com.au<br>DK Multimedia: www.dk.com<br>Internet Coach and Mission to Planet X: Perth distributor Internetso information specialists, phone 9388 2615.
