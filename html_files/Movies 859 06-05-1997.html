            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Ghosts of Mississippi (M)<br>Alec Baldwin, Whoopi Goldberg, James Woods<br>Directed by Rob Reiner<br>? ?½<br>DIRECTOR Rob Reiner, a child of Hollywood, has botched a strong, true story by bringing it to film in a superficial way in Ghosts of Mississippi.<br>Several US critics say it is because Reiner was virtually brought up on the studio lot and lived the privileged life of a Beverly Hills brat.<br>His work on Ghosts certainly shows a liking for Hollywood gloss, neatness and glamour, which audiences will sense was not abundant in racially torn Mississippi in the early 1960s, or even now.<br>Ghosts tells of black civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, who was shot in the back and died the same night that President John F. Kennedy made a landmark speech on racism and tolerance in June 1963.<br>The film portrays these events and the subsequent mistrials of alleged assassin Byron De La Beckwith at the hands of an all-white jury quickly, very quickly. We then move to 1989 where Evers' widow Myrlie is campaigning for a retrial because it has emerged the original juries may have been tampered with.<br>What the viewer loses in this great leap forward is any sense of what Evers achieved in his struggle for equal rights in Mississippi; any sense of the man's character, which was obviously so strong that white supremacists wanted him dead; and any sense of what sort of place could have provoked and condoned such hatred based on colour alone.<br>One-line hints from a few characters in the 1980s-1990s section of the film provide a few helpful guesses. But what we are left with is a mostly blank canvas which Reiner has decided to use to thinly sketch that old favourite - the young district-attorney's big day in court.<br>So a film supposedly about racial intolerance becomes another yawning star vehicle for a young, white guy in a good suit and a four-wheel-drive.<br>Alec Baldwin is just such a man. He plays John DeLaughter (pronounced De-Lawter), son-in-law of the racist judge who heard Byron Beckwith's two mistrials. Baldwin has had the occasional good role, but here he is as sincere as a used-car salesman, often lapsing out of a southern ?you-all? accent into a vapid LA twang.<br>Reiner focuses on DeLaughter's crumbling home life (his southern belle of a wife is ashamed he is taking on a black civil rights case) and his cosy, sickly cute relationship with his children. He sings Dixie to his little girl when she sees ghosts in her bedroom.<br>All this is done at the expense of shining a stronger light on the Evers' family. Widow Myrlie (Whoopi Goldberg) is a strong type who will never let the memory of her slain husband die.<br>It is a pity then that she is played with such wooden ordinariness by Goldberg, an actress capable of much better. No attempt has even been made to age her from the 1963 opening to the final trial in 1994 ... not a grey hair, nor wrinkle.<br>Ghosts does have one saving grace. James Wood as bigoted assassin Beckwith literally oozes evil. Beckwith is evil personified, from the merest flick of his disdainful fingers to the ugly pursing of lips that are capable of the worst type of racist bile.<br>Woods does his job despite being larded with make-up meant to age him. The pasty, jowelled puffiness placed on him makes one think of the evil Emperor in the Star Wars trilogy.<br>Overall - as the Monty Python crew used to say of Australian wine - this is a film for laying down and avoiding.<br></font></p>
