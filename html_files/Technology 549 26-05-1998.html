            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Internet has allowed the public spotlight to focus on the Indonesian crisis in a way that would have been impossible only four or five years ago.<br>Television might have been beaming pictures of riots, demonstrations and leaders in crisis daily. But the Net has given the people of the world's fourth most populous nation a new way to voice their feelings.<br>Hundreds of Indonesians, both at home and abroad, have learnt that the Web and newsgroups are excellent forums for letting off steam, listening to others and swapping impressions of the crisis.<br>The CNN Community site's special Indonesia section carries dozens of points of view about the troubles. These are samples from last week:<br>?They are not in fact "rioting' in order to support the accession of another secular leader to the office of president, but rather to express their rage at feeling culturally dominant, but economically less advantaged than they might like to be as individuals and as a group.?<br>?To the world, please help all victims of the current unrest in Indonesia. They are robbed or killed by the looters in most of the major cities in Indonesia. The looters used the easier way to rob the richer people or foreigners by creating the unrest.?<br>CNN and the BBC are among many media giants which have established special pages to deal with Indonesia, in addition to their constantly updated news reports.<br>CNN offers a Timeline of President Suharto's rule that provides essential background information on the strongman who decided to stand aside for the good of the country last week. The BBC goes a step further with its special Indonesia Internet Links page, produced by the corporation's Indonesian service.<br>Indonesian media are well represented online. Surfers need to be aware that many sites are purely in Indonesian, but enough offer English versions to satisfy curiosity for how the troubles are reported locally.<br>Ironically, the other advantage offered by the local media is the chance to see what the official Government viewpoint is. Mr Suharto's regime had a track record of keeping the country's press and television on a tight rein.<br>Details of riots and demonstrations are interspersed with official views ranging from the legitimacy of the Speaker's call last Tuesday for Mr Suharto to resign, to news of clean-ups in riot-torn areas.<br>Good starting points in the local media are the official Antara News Agency, Kompass, Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia (the country's biggest commercial TV network) and the Indonesian Observer.<br>The Government also has a substantial presence. All of its sites feature English versions.<br>The Republic of Indonesia Official Government Web Site is fast and easy to use. It glories in the name Indonesiatoday.com and offers the facility to search the database of current Government press releases. It also has links to general information about the country and to the controversial topic of tropical forests.<br>According to the BBC, you can also find out about the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI), however it appeared to be in Indonesian-only when Access tried it.<br>Mr Suharto, unlike John Howard or Richard Court, did not have his own site, but new President BJ Habibie, the former vice-president and technology minister, does. It has news clippings, a CV and pictures.<br>One of the best collections of general resources and links to Indonesia is maintained by the Indonesia section of the Asian Studies WWW Virtual Library project at the Australian National University.<br>AsiaNet and IndonesiaNet offer more general online guides as well.<br>People thinking of travelling to Indonesia should first check the Consular Travel Advice page offered by the Australian Foreign Affairs Department.<br>HELP DESK<br>CNN Community: community.cnn.com/cgi-bin/<br>WebX?13@@.ee8efd4<br>CNN Suharto Timeline: www.cnn.com/WORLD/<br>asiapcf/9805/18/suharto.chronology.reut/index.html<br>BBC Links: news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/<br>indonesia/internet_links/newsid_63000/63835.stm<br>Antara: www.antara.co.id/welcome-eng.html<br>Kompass: www.kompas.com<br>Television: www.rcti.co.id<br>Indonesian Observer: www.indoexchange.com/<br>bagong/general/indonesian-observer<br>Official government site: www.indonesiatoday.com<br>ABRI (armed forces): www.abri.mil.id<br>BJ Habibie: habibie.ristek.go.id<br>ANU Virtual Library: coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVLPages/IndonPages/<br>WWWVL-Indonesia.html<br>AsiaNet: www.asianet.net/indonesh.html<br>IndonesiaNet: www.indonesianet.com<br>Travel Advice: www.dfat.gov.au/consular/advice/<br>consadvice_main.html<br></font></p>
