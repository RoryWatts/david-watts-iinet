            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EMPTY vessels make the most sound, it is said. But empty cricket grounds must run a close second.<br>This is so on television news during the sport segments at the end and applies to Sheffield Shield and domestic one-day matches.<br>Rapturous cheering and loud clapping accompanies cover drives and catches, loud and long oohs and gasps attend bouncers, body blows and near-misses.<br>The trouble is the cameras capture no one there making these noises. They sweep over rows and rows of empty seats while the sound suggests a crowd gone mad. If it is a ground like the Gabba, where multi-coloured seating is used, the illusion is that thousands are there, particularly in a quick camera sweep.<br>The reality is that the sound microphones are often focused on a few hundred people in the grandstand, concentrating the sound and giving an illusion of mass excitement.<br>Noisy, empty grounds are more noticeable on Channel 10's Sports Tonight because that flawed but necessary show screens highlights of all the sport it can get. So a shield segment may have two or three games in a row and the impression is magnified.<br>It is one of modern Australia's great sporting shames that shield and domestic one-dayers attract so few people. Unreal sound does nothing to change that. Like canned laughter, it just makes things seem sad and hollow.<br>Yesterday Nine had the one-dayer between Tasmania and South Australia, and no amount of glamorisation would have added even the remotest interest for a WA viewer.<br>It was a little like those rainy, cold Sunday afternoons on which sports lovers have been forced to digest Fitzroy-Sydney as their live AFL match of the day. (That was when Fitzroy was still alive and Sydney was shocking).<br>But bless Nine for allowing Kim Hughes, Craig Serjeant and co to bring WA v Queensland into the living rooms for a couple of hours at least. We saw a tense and absorbing battle for first innings points go to the Warriors.<br>Meanwhile, Tony Greig, Bill Lawry and crew had to flog never-ending ads while letting non-interest pyjama games intrude every now and then. Surely they'd be happier in South Africa watching Mark Taylor try to redeem himself.<br>Nine's South African cop-out helps Channel 7 steal the limelight, of course. For the second week running Seven has had the most dramatic sport on the box.<br>Last time it was Pat Rafter's Davis Cup fightback. Yesterday the Australian Masters at Huntingdale had heartbeats racing all day, culminating in a play-off between Peter O'Malley and eventual winner Peter Lonard.<br>These similar-looking beefy blokes would probably be right at home in a rugby scrum or at the front bar, but they play exciting golf.<br>It was like a prize fight with platitudes added by Sandy Roberts (?it's historic, it's great, it's happening).<br>Thankfully Jack Newton and Bruce Critchley were on hand in the commentary box.<br>?He'll need intestinal fortitude here,? said Newton at one point.<br>?I don't think you need such big words Jack. It'll take guts,? replied Critchley.<br></font></p>
