            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AS FAR as I know I have never been a young blonde woman. This makes it hard to imagine what must go through their minds when they are told a blonde joke.<br>Blonde jokes seem to have been with us always. Just the other day I found a list of them 20 pages long on the Internet.<br>In that list was undoubtedly the answer to my opening musing about what goes through a blonde's mind.<br>It could be - How do you make a blonde laugh on Saturday? Tell her a joke on Wednesday.<br>Or - How do you get a blonde to marry you? Tell her she's pregnant.<br>That is cruel, but is it fair? For evidence we must look at blondes we know. True life must surely hold the clue to whether blondes deserve a dumb reputation.<br>A favourite GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) friend of mine just happens to be a very attractive blonde. Far from being dumb, she is articulate, thoughtful, kind and pleasant.<br>However, she does do blonde things.<br>The other night she was driving to our place to collect me for the movies. She used her mobile phone to ring from the car to say she was five minutes away.<br>I didn't take the call; my wife did. Now a bloke would say ?seeya in five? and hang up.<br>But GYMs love to natter and these two rabbited on for what seemed like 10 minutes. About schools and shoes and food and friends and so forth.<br>Then my wife shrieked with laughter. The blonde GYM - remember she was only five minutes away - had indeed been talking for 10. Her last words before hanging up the mobile were: ?I've just driven past your house . . . twice.?<br>I could tell you other blonde things she has done, like forgetting to make sure I was in my wheelchair before strutting off across a busy Subiaco road to the football the other day and forcing me to limp off after her on my crutch shouting: ?I really think I should be in the wheelchair.?<br>But I won't embarrass her. Instead, let us look at another young woman who, by the pictures of her in the paper and on TV, appears to be a blonde.<br>She is Michelle de Bruin (aka Smith), Ireland's triple gold medallist in swimming at the Atlanta Olympics. Her unlikely victories in 1996 - Ireland did not have one 50m pool in the country at that time - attracted a lot of innuendo.The American media in particular gossiped openly that Michelle would have needed performance-enhancing drugs to beat their own brave girls the way she did.<br>Nothing was ever found. But recently a urine sample provided by Michelle was found to contain enough alcohol to kill a normal person.The authorities allege that the sample must have been tampered with; the alcohol being used to mask something nastier like steroids.<br>Of course Michelle may well have a drink or two before tottering on to the blocks. I once drank about a bottle and a half of performance-enhancing Ouzo at a Greek party the night before a cricket match.<br>Went to bed at 7am, got to the match still stinking drunk at 9am, then made 50 with two enormous sixes and took 4 for 20 to finish off their tailenders. Went home at 6pm and slept for a day and a half.<br>Something tells me Michelle did not do similar. Even if she is a redhead whose hair has been lightened by the chlorine of countless laps, she is behaving like a blonde joke.<br>Which raises an interesting point: why are there no blond jokes, that is jokes about blokes with blond hair?<br>Personally I'm hoping we see Bulldog star Scott West turn in a blond joke of a game against the Eagles at the WACA Ground tonight.<br>And I'm not joking.<br></font></p>
