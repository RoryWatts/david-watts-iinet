            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LABOR and the coalition will fight this election on the information superhighway as well as the traditional avenues of television, radio and shopping malls.<br>Both parties have been using the Internet to snipe at each other's policies for months.<br>Labor has a professionally set-up site on the World Wide Web - the graphical section of the Net where an estimated 30 million computers share information. The Liberals have two major Web sites, both set up by keen party followers and both more than matching Labor's professionalism.<br>The Labor site responded to the election announcement immediately on Saturday, posting Prime Minister Paul Keating's full announcement of the March 2 poll. By late Sunday there had been no response from the Liberal sites.<br>On the ALP site, Labor devotes a section to John Howard Unplugged, where contradictory statements by the Opposition Leader on a wide variety of issues are published.<br>One of the two Liberal sites, LibLink, provides exhaustive policy documents, press releases, history and philosophy of the party.<br>Labor provides a section called Soapbox, where Net users can write their comments by e-mail on major issues and a selection is published.<br>The Liberals give browsers a chance to e-mail their views to Liberal politicians of their choice, but these are not published.<br></font></p>
