            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Balto (G)<br>Voices of Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins<br>Directed by Simon Wells<br>???<br>STEVEN SPIELBERG'S Amblin Entertainment has produced some dogs of animated movies. Balto, which just happens to be about dogs, is not one of them fortunately.<br>It looks to be the best of the children's films these holidays, outclassing Flipper and Muppet Treasure Island for thrills through its simplicity and exciting story-telling.<br>It is easy to see some clever borrowing for inspiration from Lady and the Tramp and a few other Disney classics. This does no harm and the fact that Balto is based on a true story makes it all the better for children, as well as adults.<br>The film is set in Nome, Alaska - near the cold top of the world - in the awful winter of 1925. The town is gripped by a diphtheria epidemic which threatens to kill 18 of the town's children.<br>No one can get the necessary antitoxin through by air, sea or road. The nearest it can come is 960km away by rail, from where it has to be picked up by a dog sled team which must make the return trip in hazardous conditions ... and quickly.<br>All this really happened and live sequences at the beginning and end of the film show Balto has been honoured by a memorial in Central Park, New York.<br>The event became known as the Great Race of Mercy to Nome and was the forerunner of what is now the famous Iditarod dog sled race.<br>All this is brought to animated life in simple but dramatic ways by the Amblin team, led by Simon Wells who cut his teeth on Who Framed Roger Rabbit.<br>Little use is made of vivid colour or sugary songs. For kids brought up on Toy Story or Babe, the lack of frills may be a setback. But the sheer excitement should overcome that as Balto, the half wolf-half dog outcast, sprints to the rescue when a dog team bringing in a diphtheria remedy for sick little girl Jennie gets lost in the snow.<br>Balto takes with him a comic Russian goose called Boris (lovely voice work by Bob Hoskins) and two lovable but screwed up polar bears (which have the voice of rock star Phil Collins).<br>Boris has one of the best lines in animated film history: ?I was so scared I got peoplebumps.?<br>The race against time pits heroic but humble Balto against grizzly bears, avalanches and falling stalactites in an ice cave.<br>Worst of all it pits him against the ugly lying Steele, a real mongrel of a dog.<br>That is all pretty exciting with enough artistic licence - like dogs tying a dead man to a sled - to produce fantasy.<br>But the real life story of Balto is just as dramatic as the film.<br>Balto and his colleagues were reportedly put in a sideshow after their 1925 fame, only to be rescued by the schoolchildren of Nome, who raised money to free them. They ended up in the Cleveland Zoo.<br></font></p>
