            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MEN of a certain age who play Saturday morning kick-to-kick trying to emulate Peter Matera's torpedoes sometimes sport T-shirts with the slogan: ?The older I get the better I was?.<br>This saying possibly explains the number of 40 to 50-year-olds who say they once tried out for West Perth or Subiaco. If they are all to be believed, Leederville Oval would have been full to capacity with spotty teenagers in the 1960s or '70s.<br>But it certainly does not apply to America's Carl Lewis.<br>Yesterday he did what many thought impossible when he won his fourth successive Olympic long jump gold.<br>It was a case of ?the older I get the better I am? ... in bursts, anyway. Lewis struggled to make these Games. He also struggled in his early qualifying attempts, finally unleashing one good jump that showed he still had championship quality.<br>And yesterday his third jump of 8.50m was too good for the rest of the field that included fellow American and world record holder Mike Powell.<br>Powell had to settle for an under-par fifth with his jump of 8.17m. He broke down in the final round and his tears were a moving sight.<br>Lewis scooped up a packet of sand from the long jump pit to celebrate and fully deserved the adulation of the crowd and the commentators.<br>Though she finished second in Australian record time to the coolly arrogant Marie-Jose Perec, of France, Cathy Freeman exuded gold.<br>She glowed with happiness. Her radiance chewed up the television like her relaxed running style chewed up six others in the 400m.<br>And her humour and frankness were fetching. Asked about the reception she was receiving from the Australian swimmers in the stands - prominent among them was Sarah Ryan painting her fingernails another ghastly colour - Freeman said: ?You'd think I'd won the bloody thing.?<br>Blood was on the after-dinner viewing menu on Monday night when Australian hockey captain Mark Hager whacked himself right between the eyes during his team's 2-0 victory over hapless Britain.<br>The injury was obviously a blokey badge of courage to commentator Richard Aggiss, himself a former top hockey player.<br>?Ah, there's a bit of claret,? he said.<br>STEVE Foley at the diving must have got carried away with the good review this column gave him. He, and not Drew Morphett this time, needed calming down when judges did not agree with his rating of Michael Murphy's excellent springboard dives.<br>?I don't know what the New Zealand judge was doing; not judging diving anyway,? said Foley.<br>But the commentator excess-of-the-day award goes to Bruce McAvaney for sniffing Michael Johnson's gold shoe.<br>We all now know McAvaney's addiction to athletic brilliance like Johnson's, but this effort gives him a sniff of winning the goose of Atlanta award ... against stiff opposition.<br></font></p>
