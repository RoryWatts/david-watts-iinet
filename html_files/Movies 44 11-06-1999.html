            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I HAVE some important and serious news to discuss this week. But before I do I would like to comment on the film Notting Hill, which opened in Perth yesterday.<br>I have not seen it, but its advance publicity suggests it will be a feel-good favourite along the lines of Four Weddings and a Funeral. With Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts as stars it is bound to be a hit.<br>What has struck me is a competition run by the gossip comic Who Weekly. It is offering a trip to Notting Hill as first prize in a test of skill that, between you and me, does not look all that skilful.<br>I do not read Who Weekly so can only guess that second prize is two trips to Notting Hill.<br>Let's face it, the west London suburb might be dressed up to impress in the movie for all I know, but I have lived there and remember it as a dire place.<br>The streets were covered in grime and rotting rubbish. The footpaths were narrow and crowded when they were accessible. Trouble was every second house was having renovations done and the footpath was the only place to stash the builder's rubble, there being no backyards. Either that or the footpath was jammed with unwanted goodies thrown there by the armies of squatters who lived in the houses that were not being renovated by yuppies.<br>My family lived in the basement flat of a big Notting Hill house for a month in the late 80s. The other four or five storeys were inhabited by a wonderful chap who used to whistle hymns. In an earlier life he was the journalist who found the body of Che Guevera.<br>Some years after we stopped being his tenants, the wonderful fellow admitted he had on occasion spied for the Soviet Union.<br>Sounds an interesting place? Maybe the people of Notting Hill are interesting, but the surrounds are dirty and grey. Enjoy the film . . . but I would not rush into trying to win a trip there.<br>Now for the serious and important news. Hang on, that can wait a bit. I have just watched The Club, the 1980 film about Australian football based on David Williamson's play. Lots of familiar faces in there; Graham Kennedy, Jack Thompson, Frank Wilson and, to deliver footy authenticity, there was Lou Richards and Scott Palmer, chief football writer at the Melbourne Sunday Herald-Sun.<br>Just for fun I checked The Club out at the Internet users' movie Bible, the Internet Movie Database, and discovered some interesting ?facts?.<br>The database says Scott Palmer appeared in the TV soapie Days of Our Lives in 1981 and had a part in the Frank Sinatra film the First Deadly Sin in 1980. And craggy old Lou Richards is credited with parts in 11 other movies plus notable TV guest appearances in shows such as St Elsewhere, CHiPs, the Dukes of Hazzard and WKRP in Cincinnati.<br>Extraordinary what you can learn on the Internet. In fact, rather than go to that important and serious news, let me digress to tell you what else is happening on the Net.<br>All-round wonderful bloke and tennis champ Pat Rafter has donated one of the shoes he wore in last year's US Open triumph for auction at the Yahoo Auction site.<br>Rafter is going virtually shoeless on behalf of the Starlight Children's Foundation, a charity that aims to brighten the lives of more than 100,000 terminally and seriously ill Australian children aged four to 18.<br>Bidding at auctions.yahoo.com/au/auction/4901749 finishes next Wednesday. More than 30 people have so far e-mailed an interest in Rafter's shoe and pumped its price from the opening bid of $199 to more than $1000.<br>Obviously it is a chance to get a sniff of victory.<br>As for that important and serious news . . . I've totally forgotten what it was.<br>Must have been a lie.<br></font></p>
