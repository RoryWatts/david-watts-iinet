            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS GST is a real worry. It places a tax burden on human endeavour. Why else wouldn't the Government exempt bootstraps?<br>I see it as part of a typical capitalist, boss, oppressor-class conspiracy against the battlers, those of us who for years have gone around saying: ?I pulled myself up by the bootstraps you know.?<br>Bootstraps may attract a wholesale sales tax now for all I know, so its replacement by a smaller GST should be welcomed shouldn't it? Not on your Nellie, I say. Pulling yourself up by the bootstraps is one of the things that makes this country great. Bootstraps, like essential health and educational services, should be free of any tax.<br>I came to this realisation about bootstraps and the GST a couple of weeks ago when an old friend from Queensland came to call. He and I like to think we have knifed our way to the middle and overcome the mountainous disadvantages of attending a country high school during the Bjelke-Petersen years . . . that is, we pulled ourselves up by the bootstraps.<br>In fact, whenever this mate and I get together the words ?pulled up by the bootstraps? are trotted out at least a dozen times.<br>On this occasion, after the second or third bottle and the 10th mention of bootstraps, we looked at each other and, obviously affected by ESP, chorused: ?What are bootstraps anyway??<br>This is a good question, particularly if bootstraps are central to your way of life.<br>After the hangover disappeared, a few days after my mate went back east to pull himself up further by the bootstraps, I began a quest to track down the said footwear item.<br>According to Webster's Dictionary, bootstrap gained currency in 1913. It is defined as ?a looped strap sewn at the side or the rear top of a boot to help in pulling it on?. More popularly though, the word is used in its plural form ?bootstraps? where the dictionary says it means ?unaided efforts - often used in the phrase by one's own bootstraps?.<br>Many questions are begged. How else could you put your boots on other than by pulling them up by their bootstraps? You couldn't pull them up by tugging on another pair of bootstraps sitting on a pair of boots in the laundry, for example.<br>And if you truly did pull yourself, rather than just your boots, up by the bootstraps, wouldn't you then have both feet in the air at the same time and fall over?<br>I guess it is not meant to be taken literally.<br>But that still doesn't mean the Government has a right to levy the GST on bootstraps. It is a most surprising oversight given that Prime Minister John Howard certainly qualifies as one who pulled himself up - from asbestos house in suburban Sydney all the way to the Lodge, Kirribilli House and receptions with St Steve Waugh as well as with our great women's hockey players.<br>The man responsible for the classiest and most Australian bootstraps, R.M. Williams, was definitely one who pulled himself up by them. Mr Williams left his home on a farm in South Australia at an early age and learnt basic bush survival skills while working in the outback as a lime burner, gold digger and camel boy for a missionary.<br>In 1932, he fashioned his first pair of riding boots. From that moment his boots and their distinctive looped bootstraps - the temptation is to call them boot loops - have become synonymous with the bush and battling to survive, and, unfortunately, with line dancing.<br>A GST on bootstraps will cripple this country. Poor people will be forced to wear boots without bootstraps. Only the fortunate few will be able to pull them up. Only a tiny percentage of those will be able to pull themselves, as well as their boots, up.<br>And then they will fall flat on their faces.<br>Surely it's time to give this iniquitous tax the boot. Either that, or start wearing thongs.<br></font></p>
