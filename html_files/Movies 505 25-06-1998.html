            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ANASTASIA<br>The legend of Princess Anastasia, reputedly the only Romanov child to escape butchering during the Russian Revolution, would seem like an unlikely subject for an all-singing, all-dancing Broadway-style cartoon. After all, how do you explain to kids about aristocrats being lined up and shot and Trotsky delivering anti-capitalist diatribes. However, veterans Don Bluth and Dan Goldman (Land Before Time, An American Tail) skip lightly over historical fact, astutely landing the blame for the bloody uprising on Rasputin and sticking closely to the 1956 feature film starring Ingrid Bergman. The result is a delightful, pulse-quickening Pygmalion-style romance in which a handsome con man named Dimitri (voiced by John Cusack) creates his Anastasia out of a poor orphan (Meg Ryan) to present to the Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury) only to learn, while falling in love, that he might have the real thing on his hands. Elegantly and imaginatively rendered, beautifully voiced - Cusack and Ryan are terrific as the sparky, screwball-style sparring lovers - and full of funny bits for kids, Anastasia is one of those rare children's films that will stir the hearts of adults. Rated G (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE BIG HIT<br>Hong Kong action director Che-Kirk Wong - known for his work with the Golden Harvest studio and Jackie Chan - makes his Hollywood debut with a black comedy that's so utterly ridiculous, so full of cliches and contrivances, so bad that it's actually quite good. Mark Wahlberg (of Boogie Nights fame) stars as the dogged Melvin Smiley, a hitman being sent broke by his gold-digging fiance and mistress. So he takes a kidnapping job on the side with his dodgy colleague Cisco (a delightfully sinister Lou Diamond Phillips). But the kidnap soon turns into a comedy of errors because the schoolgirl victim is the goddaughter of Mel's daytime boss Paris (Avery Brooks of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) - and her industrialist father has just gone bankrupt and can't pay the ransom. Outrageous gunfights and explosions, cars falling from trees, dodgy dialogue, bags of body parts and an overdue copy of the video King Kong Lives complete what is most certainly a fun and fluffy if not original film. Rated MA (Sue Yeap)<br>DR DOLITTLE<br>Forget the anal humour. Forget the shameless exploitation of cute children and talking animals with human characteristics. Because when you throw off those shackles, Dr Dolittle is funny and enjoyable. Eddie Murphy plays the uptight doctor of the title surprisingly straight, allowing the humour to bounce off him, rather than hamming it up as he sometimes does. And it works neatly in this very 90s updating of the tale. Murphy is a stressed-out medico who suddenly rediscovers his childhood talent of talking to and being understood by animals, who in turn talk back. These are modern animals with attitude, funny lines and big doses of cynicism, not all cute and fuzzy . . . especially the tiger with a chronic headache. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>WELCOME TO SARAJEVO<br>With another Sarajevo-style tragedy looming in the Serbian province of Kosovo this gritty documentary-styled drama about a journalist who becomes personally involved with a war orphan takes on a startling urgency. Based on the memoir by English TV reporter William Nicholson (played by Stephen Dillane, most recently seen as Patsy Durack in Kings in Grass Castles), Welcome to Sarajevo plunges us into the Balkan heart of darkness, cutting between the frenzied international media trying to do their jobs and the battered Sarajevans trying to stay alive. Out of the chaos, which is thrillingly constructed using real and manufactured war footage, emerges the tender, touching story of a hard-nosed newsman who breaks the rules of the game and adopts a parentless young girl. While this important film is perhaps too fragmented to be as dramatically involving as it might be, director Michael Winterbottom (Butterfly Kiss, Jude) captures the madness and terror of war in a way we haven't seen since the great Vietnam movies of the 70s and 80s (Apocalypse Now, Platoon). At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS<br>While everyone's been worrying about the age of Harrison Ford, who is paired with a woman more than two decades his junior in this desert island romance, it is not the 55-year-old star whose bones creak but the archaic plot. Surely director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Dave) could have come up with something a little fresher than stranding a crusty commercial pilot on a South Pacific island with a feisty magazine editor (Anne Heche) for Ford's first romantic comedy since Working Girl. Ford, however, is such an old charmer than he manages to make us forget the lameness of the plot, a by-the-numbers action-adventure sub-plot and a rescue sequence with echoes of Gilligan's Island (no, they don't make a radio out of coconuts but it's close) to keep us pleasantly amused to the end. And Ford and Heche, while never reaching any romantic or comedic highs, make a nice pair - not quite Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen, which they clearly want to be, but a fun duo with whom to spend a couple of hours on a desert island.
