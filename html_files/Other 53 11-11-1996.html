            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HAVING just heard the Macarena for what seems like the 545th time this week, I am glad that fate decreed I be born in a small Queensland town and be subjected to country and western music from a very early age.<br>I had no real complaints. While city kids were discovering Led Zeppelin I was quite happy for Kenny Rogers to ask Ruby not to take her love to town.<br>When Eric Burdon launched into Sky Pilot I was comfortable knowing that Hello Country Bumpkin knew the frost was on the pumpkin.<br>And as Deep Purple banged heads and Jethro Tull trilled about obscure Aqualungs, we in the bush were safe in the knowledge that we could ask a sheila to Stand by Your Man.<br>Saturday nights were cabaret nights at several pubs, featuring Ronnie and the Ramblers or the K-Dels. Running Bear was always the hit of a beer-soaked night with the dancers chanting ?in the raw? after each line: ?Running Bear ... in the raw ... loved Little White Dove ... in the raw ... with a love that could never die ... in the raw.?<br>Sad to say there are those in the wider community who delight in taking the mickey out of C and W.<br>Usually they are city types, you know as Banjo Paterson described them in Clancy of the Overflow, ?in (their) dingy little office where a stingy ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall, And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all?.<br>And one of them has sent me a list of country music titles, claiming they are all true.<br>I'll let you judge for yourselves. The best of the worst song titles are:<br>Drop Kick Me, Jesus, Through the Goalposts of Life.<br>Get Your Tongue Outta My Mouth 'Cause I'm Kissing You Goodbye.<br>Her Teeth Were Stained, But Her Heart Was Pure.<br>Been Roped and Thrown by Jesus in the Holy Ghost Corral.<br>I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling.<br>I Wouldn't Take Her to a Dawg Fight, Cause I'm Afraid She'd Win.<br>Mama Get the Hammer (There's a Fly on Papa's Head).<br>My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink, and I Don't Love Jesus.<br>My John Deere Was Breaking Your Field, While Your Dear John Was Breaking My Heart.<br>My Wife Ran Off With My Best Friend, and I Sure Do Miss Him.<br>You're the Reason Our Kids are so Ugly.<br>???<br>BILL CLINTON is back in the White House for another four years. But what is he going to do about crime? The rate might have dropped but it seems a very amateurish sort of criminal class is emerging.<br>Their feats would turn Al Capone straight.<br>In New York two men robbed a bank using their old bomb of a car for the getaway. In a helpful gesture to police they spray-painted FOR SALE and their phone number on the vehicle.<br>In Kentucky two men tried to pull the front off a cash register by running a chain from the machine to the bumper of their utility. Instead of pulling the front panel off the machine, they pulled the bumper off their truck.<br>They were so scared they left the scene and drove home ... with the chain still attached to the machine. With their bumper still attached to the chain. With their number plate still attached to the bumper.<br>A South Carolina man walked into a local police station, dropped a bag of cocaine on the counter and told the desk sergeant that it was substandard cut. He asked that the person who sold it to him be arrested immediately.<br>A man walked up to a cashier at a grocery store in Indiana and demanded all the money. The cashier handed him the loot, and the thief fled - leaving his wallet on the counter.<br></font></p>
