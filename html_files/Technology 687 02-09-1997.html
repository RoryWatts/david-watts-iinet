            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It was almost impossible to get through to the British monarchy's official Web page on the Princess of Wales on the day she died.<br>But that was no different from when she was alive. Diana was popular all the time. The formal Web page detailing her life and busy activities as an estranged member of the royals was always under siege.<br>The Web was as agog as the real world when news of her death was announced before noon on Sunday.<br>The major news arteries at CNN, the British Press Association and MSNBC updated regularly, although the blanket television coverage appeared to be an easier avenue. It was a news event that demanded passivity for the tragedy to sink in.<br>Several sites dealing with Diana - Net paparazzi if you like - were quick to catch the news and change their front pages.<br>One of the most surprising was the Royal Network's Club Di, a site which had treated the royals as a bit of joke and concentrated on innuendo and gossip.<br>But by Sunday evening, the main page was presented in black with simple white type saying: ?Diana, Princess of Wales 1961-1997. Royal Network is devastated by this tragedy. Join us in mourning. Please share your thoughts.?<br>The Princess Diana Page had been a fairly ordinary page of links to news and images of the princess on Sunday morning. By the afternoon, it had shed all links and replaced them with the WH Auden poem read at the funeral in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral.<br>Users wanting to know more about Diana have a wealth of choice. Outside the monarchy site, there is an archive of Diana stories at the Press Association Royal Diary.<br>Diana: The BBC Interview is the full transcript of the revealing interview she gave in 1995.<br>The Diana Years is a look at the princess through the countless stories and pictures of People magazine.<br>But it is a lot harder to track down information on Dodi al Fayed, Diana's companion who was also killed. CNN ran an obituary which was some help.<br>HELP DESK<br>Official royal page on Diana: www.royal.gov.uk/family/<br>diana.htmClub Di: www.royalnetwork.com/clubdi/<br>The Princess Diana Page: www.aquanet.co.il/web/bartal/<br>diana1.htmlDiana images: www.fincher.demon.co.uk/<br>DiPage1.html<br>The Diana Years: pathfinder.com/people/diana/<br>index.htmlPA Royal Diary: www.pa.press.net/news/royal/The BBC Interview: scoop.evansville.net/diana.html<br>Dodi Fayed: www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/30/obit.fayed.ap/index.html<br></font></p>
