            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ABOUT two million US Internet users have now taken part in some action to try to make the US Government amend its draconian new legislation which effectively censors the Net.<br>Hundreds of essays championing free speech are available on the Net.<br>Even Bill Gates, the multi-billionaire co-founder, chairman and chief executive of software giant Microsoft, has added his million dollars' worth.<br>A chain e-mail message urging Net users to bombard the White House with complaints this Thursday has snaked around the world, landing in my in-basket yesterday.<br>Users are being asked to sign a massive electronic petition and send it to President Bill Clinton or any congressman.<br>The cyber petition urges the Government to adopt an amendment to the Constitution enforcing freedom of expression by means of any technology, not just in speech or the Press.<br>Net users in Australia have become familiar with the online protest at thousands of sites where background screens have been black for nearly a month.<br>The culprit in all this is the Communications Decency Act signed into law by Mr Clinton on February 8.<br>The Act provides for the deregulation of the industry. For consumers, it holds out the prospect of ?one-stop shopping?, with telephone, television, Internet access and other services all coming down the same line, and all on the same bill.<br>But the Act also attempts to limit what can be seen or sent on the Internet.<br>The repressive measures in the Bill virtually stop Net users discussing contentious subjects such as abortion. Critics say the Government has used the Bill as a sledgehammer to crack the walnut problem of child pornography.<br>Some of the protests are from children, many are from families who plead that they are the ones to regulate what their children see.<br>One particularly strong appeal is from a New York woman immobilised into a wheelchair by a car accident.<br>Iliana Filby of Schenectady details her fight for personal freedom with the help of a notebook computer, old modem and a lot of courage.<br>?The hope that I have regarding my own future is due in large part to the place that the Internet has had in my recent life, and the place that I've had in the life of the Internet,? Ms Filby said.<br>http://www.hotwired.com/userland/24/<br></font></p>
