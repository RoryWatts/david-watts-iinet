            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPEED kills on the normal highway, but on the so-called information superhighway it thrills.<br>Surfing the Internet at anything less than 14.4kbps is a recipe for bitter frustration.<br>Home pages that promise so much can seem to take ages to load. But Net surfing can be up to three times faster. The answer lies on the hard disk of your own computer.<br>Saving Web pages to the disk for recall during later surfing sessions will cut access time to less than a heartbeat even for the hyperactive. The sacrifice is the loss of graphics.<br>To save an Internet page to disk, click open the file menu of Netscape and select Save As. Nominate the drive, directory and path and okay it. The hypertext mark-up language version of the page (htm) will be saved. To access the page when surfing, simply enter the full file name in the Location box of your browser and hit the Enter key.<br>For example, say you want to get a fast turnaround on Aussie.com's indexed list of personal home pages. You access the URL http://www.aussie.com.au/personal/ai-per.htm in the normal way. It should take between one and two minutes to form in the normal way.<br>When Netscape gives you the ?document done? message you can save the page.<br>Call it c:\net\aussie.htm for example. When you want to access the index in future just type c:\net\aussie.htm in the Location box and hit Enter.<br>A warning. Any page which reads its creator's hard disk, rather than accessing external links is no good to you because your computer does not have those internal files.<br>Your own bookmarks are as good as any place to start with a ?home page? on your hard disk.<br>Bookmarks are usually copied automatically to a read-only file called bookmark.htm. Find where that file is and copy it - say to a file called c:\net\book.htm. Then replay it through the Location box of Netscape. It is a crude but effective way of having your own home page.<br></font></p>
