            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ADELAIDE'S great AFL grand final win has taught us many things.<br>For a start it means no football - apart from the SANFL grand final next week - until the Ansett Cup gets under way next February.<br>Terrible confirmation of this great void came on Sunday afternoon when Channel 7 ran the Elvis Presley movie, Viva Las Vegas.<br>At the same time, SBS was showing tall girls in skimpy bikinis playing for the world beach volleyball championships in China.<br>The silly season seems to have hit.<br>Let us hope the next few months gives Seven ample time for thought. Its blanket coverage of football improved technically again this year.<br>But it needs to work harder to stop its slow-motion replays interfering with vital live action, as they did at least twice during the grand final.<br>It also needs to think hard about showing the time left each time it flashes the score on screen. Many readers of this column have written to complain that this spoils their enjoyment of close finishes.<br>Clocks that show the time elapsed are at every ground, and that is what the ABC prefers in its Westar coverage.<br>Another area requiring much thought is Victorian domination of football shows. Neither the Footy Show on Nine nor Seven's Live and Kicking could resist baring their very Victorian roots last week.<br>Live and Kicking was the worse offender with both Jason Dunstall and James Hird appearing almost arrogant in their dismissal of Adelaide. It was pure them-and-us stuff, with Dunstall throwing a Crows toy off stage as he stated his preference for a Victorian win.<br>The show seemed to forget it was being beamed to all Australian football followers ... or maybe Victorian arrogance is a ratings ploy.<br>Hird went one worse when he wrote the Crows off at half-time, saying they were too tired and had had to travel too much to threaten North Melbourne's 24-point lead.<br>A lot of people probably thought the same way, but we did not hear from Hird again during the telecast to learn his thoughts of the inspired Adelaide fightback.<br>In retrospect, it is so easy to knock the Vics and their desire to keep the premiership at all costs.<br>But this is the 90s and the cup has gone west four times in seven years, for goodness sake.<br>Surely it is time for both Seven and Nine to spread their wings and seek out more balanced coverage of the AFL.<br>Sam Newman gave a mature view in the regular Thursday night Footy Show and the special Saturday night awards show. If Newman can do it, anyone in Victoria can ... you can always dream.<br></font></p>
