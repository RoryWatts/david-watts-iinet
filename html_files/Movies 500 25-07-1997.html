            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CON AIR, the latest Hollywood blockbuster to hit Perth movie screens, is sometimes wrongly called the ultimate blokes' movie.<br>This is wrong. Con Air lacks gratuitous sex scenes with either Geena Davis or Drew Barrymore.<br>But by and large it is a very blokey movie. At a few stages actual acting is allowed to get in the way of action which involves a plane hijacked by murderous scum tearing up a big proportion of Las Vegas.<br>This leads to a climactic chase by men on high-speed motorbikes in pursuit of a fire engine. Despite falling metres at great speed, the hero of the piece, Nicholas Cage - with shoulders even Anthony Koutoufides would die for - survives with barely a scratch to be reunited with his unbearably cute wife and to present a sodden and bloodstained bunny rabbit to his even more unbearably cute daughter.<br>This is after the fire engine ploughs into an armoured truck, spraying the streets with its contents of squillions of dollars, and after the villainous Cyrus the Virus, played by John Malkovich, is laid to rest with his head in the direct path of a pile-driver.<br>There are about two dozen cold-blooded murders, a battle scene in a junkyard of wrecked planes, several towering inferno explosions of fuel dumps and even a car being towed into mid-air by the hijacked plane.<br>In the realm of blokes' movies it is a high achiever. When there is talking - and there is about one-hundredth as much as in a girlie film like Mermaids - it is to the point and guttural.<br>For example: ?On the whole I'd rather be crushing your larynx with my foot.? (This from one of the good guys).?Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally insane.?<br>?On any other day, that might seem strange.? (On seeing the car being towed in the air by the plane.)<br>?They call him Cyrus the Virus. He claims he's killed more people than cancer.?<br>?There's only two men I trust. One is me. The other is not you.? (The hero, obviously).<br>You get the drift. But what makes this so enjoyable? To answer that you must know what a bloke is.<br>Obviously a bloke is a male, but he is a male with distinct characteristics. The most important is that he likes footy. Number two is beer, three is TV and four is women (but not necessarily for conversation).<br>These attributes will be in any order in younger years, but by the 40s should have settled into the pattern of 1. TV; 2. Footy; 3. Beer; 4. Women.<br>The greatest exponent of the art of blokiness is Channel 10's Homer Simpson. Even though he is American and rumoured to be a cartoon character, his habits of sitting in front of the TV, having a few beers with his mates, doing dumb things and constantly being outsmarted by women -his wife Marge and daughter Lisa - puts him high in the blokes' super league.<br>Several of the following quotations about differences between men and women could apply to Homer - and all blokes for that matter: ?When a man goes on a date he wonders if he is going to get lucky. A woman already knows.? - Frederick Ryder.<br>?Women need a reason to have sex -men just need a place.? -Billy Crystal.<br>?A woman's appetite is twice that of a man's; her sexual desire, four times; her intelligence, eight times.? - Sanskrit proverb.<br>?Only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. One is to let her think she is having her own way, and the other is to let her have it.? - Lyndon B. Johnson.<br>Probably the best is this. And the fact that the wise one has been too scared to leave a name means he is scared of female retaliation. Obviously a bloke:<br>?God made man before woman to give him time to think of an answer for her first question.? - Anonymous.<br></font></p>
