            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I ONCE played croquet against C-3PO and he beat me comfortably. He was not wearing the gold-coloured robot suit that sets him apart as the prissy translator in the Star Wars movies. But I knew it was him. He told me so.<br>My croquet conqueror actually introduced himself as Anthony Daniels and with a hang-dog look and morose voice, so different to the fussy high tones in the films, proceeded to answer my questions about being a famous robot.<br>He was sick of being C-3PO. All people wanted him to do was to don his gold suit and be fussy and pedantic. Big Japanese shopping centres could not get enough of him.<br>He had even conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in front of a packed house at London's Royal Albert Hall . . . in his fibreglass C-3PO costume.<br>He hated R2D2. His ambition to be a serious stage actor was in tatters.<br>Truly, Daniels had paid the price of fame. When I think about it he is the most famous person I have met, certainly the most famous - in fact the only person - I have played croquet against.<br>I met him - Daniels and C-3PO - in 1990, on a summer's day at a sumptuous country house in Sussex.<br>Why was I there? Why was C-3PO beside me, failing miserably, like all Poms, to get lunch together on the barbecue?<br>My wife had met another GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) at a gorgeous young mums-to-be meeting and they had become friends. This other GYM was a costume designer whose partner was a budding producer. They had been invited to the Sussex weekend retreat of the business editor of a London newspaper. He was the producer's mentor and sponsor and would look at his latest plans.<br>The GYM and the producer asked my wife and me along. When we got to the pretty house and its rolling lawns - perfect for croquet - the first thing I noticed was that the business editor's company car was a Porsche. Mine - I was something to do with computers at a rival paper - was a poky little Peugeot.<br>Clearly, our different newspapers were on different financial planets.<br>The second thing I noticed was this sad, thin man, who turned out to be the famous C-3PO.<br>Why bring all this hob-nobbing and croquet up now?<br>Well, Anthony Daniels, whose career before Star Wars involved much Shakespearean work with the Young Vic, is back as C-3PO in the much-hyped Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace, which hits Perth on Thursday.<br>Actually Daniels will not be in C-3PO's suit because as the film is set long before the three we have already seen, C-3PO is in an early prototype stage. He has no innards, so Daniels will supply only the well-known voice.<br>Despite his protestations while belting me at croquet, Daniels really has a soft spot for his character. He has revealed his liking at one of the many Internet sites devoted to C-3PO. ?See-Threepio (as real Star Wars fanatics call him) is really a very loveable character, which is one reason why I stuck with him,? says Daniels.<br>"He has the manners and qualities of a well-bred, well-paid, high-class English butler. He is very much at home in any social gathering where cocktails are being served and people are behaving politely to one another (croquet games, for example).?<br>Daniels appears to have come to terms with his lot. Since Return of the Jedi was made 16 years ago, C-3PO has been trotted out in films called Special Effects: Anything Can Happen, Star Tours and a TV special called Droids (The Adventures of C-3PO and R2D2).<br>Away from life as C-3PO, Daniels has managed parts in two Prime Suspect episodes and a film titled I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle.<br>I intend to have a look at the Phantom Menace once the over-hyped crowds start to thin.<br>You might be lucky enough to sit beside me. I'll be the one cheering when C-3PO appears and saying: ?Did you know he once beat me at croquet??<br></font></p>
