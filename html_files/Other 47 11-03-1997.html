            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SCANDAL lovers will have to look elsewhere, there is only one picture of Diana, and the reason the Queen keeps corgis is pretty mundane (she had them as a child and liked them).<br>The British monarchy leapt into the late 20th century last Friday when Queen Elizabeth, sensibly rugged up against the UK cold, launched her family's own Web site.<br>Television pictures of the event suggest Her Majesty had only a nodding acquaintance with a mouse, but was happy to show the virtual world the House of Windsor.<br>It is a pretty sanitised site, dealing in plain and bland facts about the crown jewels, members of the family (Di in, Fergie out), the succession (women need not apply) and the Queen's supposed wealth.<br>?Today my message is speeding its way around the world by radio and, for the first time, on the Internet,? the Queen said.<br>Seeming a little wary of the new technology, she said: ?Of course, having more ways of communicating and faster ways of doing so does not necessarily mean that we understand each other better. Technical advances do not automatically bring improvements.<br>?Talking to one another is not a one-way process: we can explain our own points of view but we should also listen to the views of others.<br>?Commonwealth countries have an advantage in doing this because we have shared views of right and wrong, and because we use the common language of English.<br>?Whichever way we choose to communicate, the important point is that we keep talking and keep listening.<br>?By doing so, we ensure that the Commonwealth continues to grow as an informed and open-minded community of nations.?<br>Even though the site is bland, it is important to have the royals on the Web.<br>The British royal family still plays a big part in the running of Britain and the Commonwealth and has as much right to cyber airspace as the White House or the Australian Parliament.<br>URLs<br>British Monarchy - www.royal.gov.uk<br>Australian Monarchist League - www.monarchist.org.au<br>Australians for Constitutional Monarchy - www.mq.edu.au/hpp/politics/acm.html<br>Australian Republican Movement - www.republic.org.au<br></font></p>
