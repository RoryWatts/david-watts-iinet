            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE footy season is over, but someone forgot to tell the ABC.<br>Channel 2 gave WA's favourite winter sport a rousing send-off by showing the SANFL grand final live from Adelaide yesterday.<br>To keep rugger types happy, Aunty had the Sydney club rugby union grand final live on Saturday, too.<br>Just for good measure, Two also replayed the brilliant Westar Rules grand final of two weeks ago in its entirety that afternoon.<br>Even though the result was known - South Fremantle by a goal in the dying minutes - the Westar clash still made the best TV. What city viewers did not see a fortnight ago, was the way East led at all three changes, and seemed to have the contest in the bag for the club's centenary year.<br>On grand final day, Two showed live only the thrilling last quarter.<br>On Saturday, viewers who forsook the Perth spring sunshine or the constant drone of Bathurst or Phillip Island, were able to figure out why Trevor Jenkins and Wally Foreman had worked themselves into such a state by midway through the final term.<br>And they were able to indulge themselves in that favourite couch potato pastime of retrospective wisdom, particularly when the commentary team spoke glumly of South's ?last throw of the dice? when the Bulldogs were nearly five goals down.<br>It was close and exciting.<br>Two's live offerings were both one-sided affairs: Norwood gave Port Adelaide its biggest hiding (73 points), and Manly stomped all over Eastwood, 34-19, after leading 27-0 at half-time.<br>The ABC now has the curious honour of showing the second-best and the worst, and second-worst grand finals for the year.<br>A league table of grand finals would go like this: 1. ARL (Channel 9); 2. Westar Rules (2); 3. AFL (7); 4. Super League (9); 5. Sydney rugby (2); 6. SANFL (2).<br>The final bows of the footy season allowed basketball to hoist itself back on the peak-time stage.<br>Channel 10 has hidden the NBL all winter because it knows it cannot compete with Seven's football. The result has been an army of disappointed fans who have had no guarantee they will see the Perth Wildcats play.<br>The way Ten has run its NBL coverage, viewers find themselves in a sort of lottery where the dubious prize can be Illawarra v Newcastle at some unseemly hour.<br>But on Saturday night at 8.30pm, all that could have been forgiven. The Wildcats-Brisbane Bullets' first playoff game was a cracker, with Perth digging itself out of a 12-26 first quarter to win, 81-79.<br>It might have been a mixed blessing that the NBL played such a minor part in TV sport. Basketball has a very American hometown approach to barracking, which goes all the way through to the commentary.<br>It is mostly ?we? this and ?we? that, capped by Tim Gossage's bellowing ?Crrrawwfud? when the Alabama Slammer slam-dunks.<br>You can almost bet the coverage from Brisbane tomorrow will be a little different.<br></font></p>
