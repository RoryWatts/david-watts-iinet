            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WAS easy to tell spring had sprung earlier this week. My dog jumped the fence. He has never even looked at a fence in his two years with us . . . well he has but not with the intent of jumping one.As an easygoing, slightly lazy cavalier king charles spaniel, he seemed to figure his role in life was to lie on cushions looking regal.<br>But there was a lady involved this time, as you might have guessed.<br>He was mating with a lovely king charles brought to our place by a GYM (gorgeous young mum) who had heard of his alleged prowess.They were getting on famously, my dog and the GYM's. Then hers jumped the fence in one bound. It had not entered my head that a cavalier would do this because of our dog's reluctance.<br>In what seemed like seconds, but was actually microseconds, my dog followed, pulled by lust and love.<br>Panic set in . . . not among the lovebirds who were frolicking on the daisy-spotted footpath and the car-spotted road. For those who don't know me, I ride an electric wheelchair. It has a top speed of 9kmh . . . downhill with a following breeze.<br>The dogs were cavorting at about 20kmh uphill, so my pursuit and panicked calling were at a truly pedestrian rate.<br>A GYM who was driving past saw the predicament. She started warning motorists to slow down and look out for the dogs and alternately tried to shepherd them in her car, or hopped out and tried to herd them on foot.<br>A friendly neighbour joined the pursuit. Soon we cornered the male. This was a big mistake. The female did not seem to care and just frolicked off in the opposite direction.<br>If we had caught her, the male would have followed her back to the love nest from 100km away.<br>But the female did come back, quite nonchalantly, wondering what all the yapping fuss was about. Two neighbours followed her down the road.<br>THEN the dogs fell in love all over again and jumped the fence again before I could tie them up. It was a less dramatic chase. They went next door, then wandered home again just in time for the female's owner who I had called in a right old panic to arrive to take them to her place which, she said, had virtual prison walls.<br>I was not just close to tears, a Bex and a good lie-down; I was close to gaining entry to the doghouse. What if one or both had been run down? What if someone had crashed trying to avoid them? What if a neighbourhood mongrel had taken a fancy to the female?<br>But a spell in the doghouse would have been warranted for any of these crimes. Doghouses are where we blokes end up every now and then, mostly always on trumped-up charges.<br>It could be something as trivial as passing on this conversation I overheard the other day:<br>?You know why God is not a female. If She was, She would still be making up her mind what colour to have the oceans.?<br>I disagree with this. She would have chosen it quite quickly. She just wouldn't be happy with the result and would get a little man back in to do it again . . . and get it right this time.<br>There are a number of rules that blokes must remember if they want to avoid the doghouse. These come courtesy of correspondent Robynne, who told us all about lifts a couple of weeks ago. They are called the rules of life:<br>1. The Female always makes the rules.<br>2. The rules are subject to change without notice.<br>3. No bloke can possibly know all the rules.<br>4. If the Female suspects the bloke knows all the rules, she must immediately change some.<br>5. If it appears the Female is wrong, it is because of a flagrant misunderstanding caused by something the bloke did or said wrong.<br>6. The Female can change her mind at any time.<br>7. The Female has every right to be angry or upset at any time.<br>8. The bloke must remain calm at all times, unless the Female wants him to be angry or upset.<br>9. The Female must, under no circumstances, let the bloke know whether she wants him to be angry or upset.<br>10. At all times, what is important is what the Female meant, not what she said.<br>No column next week; I have urgent business at the MC . . . err, in Melbourne.<br></font></p>
