            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">www.sattler.com.au<br>Like him or loathe him, 6PR talk-back host Howard Sattler has influence.<br>This site - neatly designed by a team that includes his wife and sometimes radio co-star, Despene - theoretically widens Sattler's audience. It also widens the chances of disagreement with the opinionated one. And the site has plenty of feedback slots where you can have your say. An Opinion site may be causing some anxiety. It enables surfers to vote<br>- usually yes or no - on a topical issue such as should Australia become a republic.A poll last week on the abortion issue produced staggering one-sided results that suggest it is too easy to keep hitting the reload button. Sattler Online echoes the issues discussed on the radio show and there is a steadily growing archive of them to keep you content ? or furious. (DW)<br>Internet Park<br>www.amo.qc.ca/parc/<br>indexPark.html<br>If you become addicted to the word games on offer here - and it is easy to do - you will end up paying for it. Internet Park allows people to register and play for 20 days free before extracting a commitment ? and cash.The site lets you have lots of fun with words by presenting a variety of games involving the unscrambling of letters. All are played online and scores can be compared with the efforts of other Park players and with a master computer which is said to unscramble every word in every game. (DW)<br>A Web of Online Grammars<br>www.bucknell.edu/%7Erbeard/<br>grammars.html<br>The grammarians of ancient Arabia were second only to royal families in status, such was the importance placed on the structure of language in those times. Alas, gone are those golden days of linguistic veneration - now any goon wanting to create a memorable name for a company feels quite at home capitalising letters willy-nilly, shoving words together and committing other atrocities with impunity.Not to mention Apple's blatant abuse of the adverb in its latest advertising campaign (does ?Think different? bother anyone else?)<br>If you want a dose of the right stuff, head to Robert Beard's excellent compilation of grammars on the Web. Whether you are into Tagalog, Tamil, Turkish, or just plain English, you will find rules aplenty here. Comprehensive and correct. (HC)<br>Measurements Converter<br>www.ur.ru/ ~sg/transl/<br>This is one of those incredibly useful sites which pop up on the Web from time to time. It doesn't waste time, it doesn't attempt to entertain you and it does something which has an application outside the world of the Internet. Crazy, but true.Simply select your area of measurement (weight, volume, length, area, speed, pressure, temperature, circular measure, or time), enter the amount you want converted in the relevant box, hit return and, bang!, your conversions are returned instantly. There is no waiting for Internet lag because the converter is loaded in Java.<br>The conversions are impressive in their breadth - there are 62.5 old Russian poods in a metric tonne in case you ever wondered. This is a good example of simple but useful programming. (HC)<br>Spam Haiku<br>www.e-z-smith.com/<br>spam.html<br>I stumbled across this piece of silliness while searching for software designed to block and filter junk e-mail, aka spam. This site houses a collection of verse dedicated to the canned meat variety of Spam, which I doubt has any more merit than its infuriating electronic namesake.But some think otherwise, as seen in these examples: ?Ears, snouts, and innards, A homogeneous mass, Pass another slice? and ?Pink tender morsel, Glistening with salty gel, What the hell is it?"I don't think we need to know. (SY)<br>Deepak Chopra Homepage<br>www.randomhouse.com/features/<br>chopra/<br>This is an unashamed promotional site from book publishers Random House, aimed at getting more people to buy books by one of its big-selling star authors. But Deepak Chopra, probably the biggest name in so-called alternative medicine, has a lot to tell the world.He is a pioneer in helping individuals maximise their ability to achieve success and fulfilment through mind/body techniques. Dr Chopra, the publishers say, is expanding the concept of good health and self-knowledge through a blending of Western medicine with the ancient techniques of Ayurvedic health- care.Ayurveda's basic tenet is that one's physical health is the balanced integration of body, mind, and spirit. You don't have to buy anything and it is a good place to find out a little more about life.
