            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HUNDREDS of millions of Web sites exist, according to the best guesses.<br>The sheer size makes it virtually impossible to compile a top 10 for 1998.<br>But in the spirit of the season which breeds best-of and top-10 lists to hide the fact that not a lot else is happening, here is a stab at 10 significant sites from the past 12 months<br>1. The Starr Report<br>THIS year was surely the year the world was subject to sordid details on a scale never seen before.<br>US President Bill Clinton's affair of the smoking trousers with Monica Lewinsky has consumed the Web, not least because the US dominates the user base.<br>The Starr Report was released online and instantly gobbled up by other media.<br>Prurient souls can use their browser's find function and type in the word ?cigar? for a quick and sensationalist read.<br>2. Bill Gates' evidence on video<br>THE US Department of Justice and several States have taken Microsoft to court accusing it of using its muscle as the dominant provider of operating systems to overpower the Web browser market.<br>Company chief Bill Gates has been giving his evidence on a video, and CNN has that long, often complicated tape. You can search for a word like ?Netscape? (the main offended party) and be presented with a choice of short out-takes from the video showing Mr Gates trying to explain himself.<br>3. Halloween documents<br>THERE is another operating system besides Windows, and it is free. Not a lot of people know that, but it is called Linux. It powers the majority of Internet servers in the world. One user says it was 325 days before his system crashed. You have to be patient and focused to learn the rudiments, but once up and running Linux is considered the best.<br>Microsoft knows this and has put out long memos describing Linux as potentially its biggest threat.<br>If you are an avid PC user, these leaked documents will be good holiday reading.<br>4. Prince Charles<br>THE Windsors went online last year with a rather staid site. The Prince of Wales decided to break free this year and put his own mark on cyberspace.<br>His site has very little mention of Diana, but it does provide discussion forums and a feedback section. You may never get this close to royalty in real life.<br>5. Online Surgery<br>EVERY list should have a silly entry, and this is it.<br>Want to see tummy tucks, liposuction and nose jobs? This Seattle site shows a video of such operations every week and even allows surfers the chance to win a free, televised operation.<br>6. Cricket Unlimited<br>BUT seriously ... aren't we giving England a terrible time in cricket?<br>Actually, the English press is far more vocal and savage. This is the Guardian's cricket site, and though the paper is usually more genteel than its tabloid counterparts, its cricket writing is about as genteel as a night out with Ian Botham and Ian Chappell.<br>7. The Average Human Face<br>NOT a wildly successful site yet. But the thought is a good one.<br>The creators have asked surfers to submit pictures of themselves. Faces are then melded together to show an ?average? face.<br>8. Top 40 hits, 1930-98<br>NOW you can find all the lyrics to those songs you want to sing in the shower, or on New Year's Eve.<br>The resource depends on people caring as much about trivia as you.<br>9. Pauline Hanson's One Nation<br>SHE'S gone, right? No longer in Parliament? Hardly seen on TV?<br>Wrong. The red-headed Queenslander is alive and kicking on the Web, despite being humbled in the October Federal election. Her name is on the party and the site. Her image is everywhere. She will not go away.<br>10. Internet Movie Database<br>AN old favourite that shows you do not need lots of fancy graphics or technology to make the Web a great tool.<br>HELP DESK<br>Starr Report: reports.guardian.co.uk/sp-reports/starr/report/report.html<br>Gates videos: www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/video/gates<br>Halloween memo: www.opensource.org/halloween.html<br>Prince Charles: www.princeofwales.gov.uk<br>Online Surgery: www.onlinesurgery.com<br>Cricket Unlimited: www.cricketunlimited.co.uk<br>Average Human Face: www.webdweller.com<br>Top 40 hits: www.summer.com.br/~pfilho/html/top40/index.html<br>One Nation: www.onenation.com.au<br>Internet Movie Database: www.imdb.com<br></font></p>
