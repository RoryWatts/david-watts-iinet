            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Last week was a busy time for defenders of users' rights on the Internet.<br>The Australian Democrats announced last Friday that they were tabling a private Senators' Bill to prevent timed data calls through B-party charging. Telstra has previously said it has no interest in time-charging local calls, despite many months lobbying the Federal Government vigorously for the right to do so.<br>?We're aiming to see that the Net remains untimed for users,? Democrats Senator Lyn Allison said. ?It would be a mandatory condition of a carrier licence (to do so).?<br>Australian Telecommunications Users' Group managing director Allan Horsley said last week that there was no need to charge for calls handled by the same telephone exchange. He was responding to plans by Victorian company Northgate Communications to offer free local call access to its subscribers.<br>In the US, the Communications Decency Act was struck down by the Supreme Court in a 7-2 decision. The American Civil Liberties Union, itself one of more than 20 plaintiffs to the Act's legality, declared the decision ?virtually unanimous? because the dissenting votes agreed in part with the majority decision.<br>The CDA imposed harsh penalties on users found viewing or transmitting ?indecent? material. But the court found that the technology to screen this information was not yet widely available. Further, it found that the Act places an ?unacceptably heavy burden on protected speech?.<br>?We presume Government regulation of the content of speech is more likely to interfere with the free exchange of ideas than to encourage it.?<br>Despite this setback for the advocates of online censorship, the Computer Daily News reported on Friday that the Australian Government is pushing ahead with its plans to echo the now discredited CDA. The Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies has recommended that State and Federal Governments should outlaw pornography or violence on the Net and other electronic services.<br>The committee rejected the notion that ISPs had no control over material accessed through their services, but said self-regulation was possible. Labor and the Australian Democrats have rejected the proposed Bill.<br>Another Senate committee is gearing up to tackle Net regulation, this time investigating electronic commerce and share transactions in cyberspace.<br>Students insafe hands<br>WorkSafe has been beavering away getting the safety message across to thousands of students on the Web.<br>Labour Relations Minister Graham Kierath says 10,000 high-school students in WA have graduated from a work safety program on the Net, believed to be the world's first.<br>The education program at WorkSafe's Web site is aimed at students in Years10-12, particularly those doing work experience.<br>The site invites them to study WA's safety laws and general workplace practices, then take part in a multiple-choice exam on-screen.<br>Those answering 75 per cent or more questions correctly are awarded an online graduation certificate signed by the Minister.<br>The certificate is not a formal qualification but is designed to show employers that potential workers understand safety issues.<br>HELPDESK<br>B-party charging: the charging of the receiver of a call, not the initiator as is usually the case. Currently,for example, used by 1-800 numbers. In this case, it would mean that the ISP would pay the timed connect charge, not the user.<br>Telstra position on B-party charging: www.telstra.com.au/press/yr97/apr97/untimed.htm<br>Australian Democrats: www.democrats.org.au<br>Australian Telecommunications Users' Group: www.aclu.org<br>Worksafe program: sage.wt.com.au/safetyline/training/tran_ind.htm<br></font></p>
