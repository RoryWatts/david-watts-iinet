            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.au All sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>Walter Vivian's Poetry<br>www.iinet.net.au/ ~walt<br>Self-proclaimed ?teacher, writer, artist and beachbum? Walter Vivian is also a poet of some note. Some of his works have been published in The West Australian. At Walweb you can find out about his education, artistic and family background, plus read the online version of his book of poetry, Not a Proper Shop. The paper version was published in December and is a collection of verse based on Vivian's ?good fortune? growing up in and around Perth. You can read about his works in progress, another book of poetry and a novel called Sins Of The North which is ?set in our near-north, purporting to be an exchange of letters between and aging retired schoolmaster and his adventurous former pupil who has taken up an ambiguous position in a strange, exotic land?. One chapter is online and there will be regular updates. (SY)<br>Federal Government<br>www.fed.gov.au<br>Want to find the Prime Minister's home page or check out his current ministerial list? Perhaps you want to find the Web site for the Australian Taxation Office, the Federal Airports Corporation or the National Museum of Australia? Then visit the Federal Government's new one-stop shop (or single entry point) on the Internet.<br>An initiative of the Office of Government Information Technology, AusInfo and the National Library of Australia, this neatly designed and easily navigable site should save a lot of bookmarking and prove popular with everyone from students seeking information for projects to business people who deal with the Commonwealth Government. (SY)<br>COMMUNITY<br>Atwell House and Gallery<br>www.wantree.com.au/ ~designer/<br>atwell/<br>Atwell House and Gallery, located in heritage farm buildings on the Swan River waterfront in the sensitive wetland area of Alfred Cove, was the first community-access gallery in Perth and is run by the community for the community. At this Web site you can learn about the activities of Atwell House, which aims to promote and support all forms of arts and crafts and runs classes, workshops, master classes, lectures and other activities. It also offers an ?advice, consultancy and administration service, supports minority and ethnic groups in presenting their cultures, and promotes art education in the community?. There is also extensive information about Atwell Gallery, which exhibits a range of work including the Melville Art Award and works by local artists. Art buffs will enjoy testing their knowledge in the art quiz and there is also an art jigsaw and online etch-a-sketch game to keep visitors amused. (SY)<br>COMPUTING<br>Text-to-Speech Synthesis<br>www.bell-labs.com/project/tts/<br>This site looks dull, but appearance is deceptive. Bell Labs has developed an online text-to-speech system that reads typed-in text, then synthesises it into an audio file so that your computer can speak the words back to you. You can save the resulting files for other uses. One correspondent now has a PC which says: ?I love you.? TTS - as it is called - has various applications including reading electronic mail, generating spoken prompts in voice response systems, and as an interface to an order-verification system for salespeople in the field. That is the commercial side. For surfers looking for mild but useful entertainment, the site has demos which allow the user to choose the type of voice - male, female and even one called ridiculous - the language (three or four alternatives) and then has a window to type text. A press of the Enter or Return key triggers conversion of the text to your desired audio format and you are presented with a synthetic voice reciting your words.

But the beauty of Shane Richmond's site is the fun value. He has Freo Karaoke which allows you to sing along to the stirring club song; Mixed Marriages, where images of players are mixed together for humorous results, and 3D pictures. But the biggest attractions are his Shockwave games. The best are Virtual Willsy and Whack an Eagle (a shameless rip-off of Slap a Spice Girl). In Virtual Willsy you have to ?kick? a 50m goal after the siren in the grand final to give the Dockers their first flag. The catch is . . . a terminally ill Docker supporter, a little girl at that, has foregone a life-saving operation to watch the game. Your accuracy is suddenly chillingly crucial. In Whack an Eagle you have to use a virtual shovel to knock out Eagles players - and coach Mick Malthouse - who are spying on a Dockers training session. But watch out for Luke Toia. The games are slow to load, but worth the wait. (DW).<br></font></p>
