            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INSULTS, abuse and anger are dominating political discussions on the Internet.<br>One Net correspondent claims he has received a threatening e-mail from a person pretending to be Prime Minister Paul Keating.<br>The ferocity of electronic debate has increased steadily since the March 2 poll was announced.<br>The newsgroups aus.politics and aus.general are the hotbed of sledging, with 100 or more discussion items posted each day this week.<br>These groups attracted 30 or 40 messages a day before the election announcement.<br>Newsgroups are electronic bulletin boards where ideas, advice and insults can be exchanged. More than 6500 newsgroups are accessible to WA Net users.<br>On Tuesday a correspondent to aus.politics, who calls himself bati, claimed he had received a threatening e-mail signed by Paul Keating.<br>The e-mail was labelled a crude bid to stifle political debate. Bati said that in the past he had been abused by people with different views and called names by others.<br>But newsgroup debate usually ended cleanly after a fair exchange of views.<br>In the ?Keating? case, however, bati claimed that abuse and fear of different views had reached new depths.<br>The ?Keating? e-mail, which bati says he deleted from his computer in anger after reading, said that lawyers would take legal action against bati because of defamatory statements made in the newsgroup.<br>Bati wrote that he felt sure the real Mr Keating would not try to kill debate with lawyers.<br>?The real Paul Keating has far too much personal integrity to do anything like that,? he said.<br>?I find it absolutely disgusting that any person, in order to attempt to shut up any opponent, uses a method which puts the Prime Minister in such adverse light. He has not deserved that.?<br>Bati had attacked Mr Keating's policies in previous postings.<br>Overall, the aus.politics newsgroup has arguments about three to one against the Government.<br>But in the past two days, more correspondents were posting messages doubting the ability of either major party to run the country.<br>Political bias is also a hot topic, particularly referring to the graphic interface of the Net, the World Wide Web.<br>Self-confessed conservative David Moss, a technical officer at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra, runs a site on the Web devoted to Australian politics.<br>He also maintains a site for the Liberal Party.<br>Mr Moss wrote in aus.politics that he wanted a Liberal victory.<br>?Put Labor last,? he said.<br>A correspondent countered saying Mr Moss should not use Internet facilities at the academy to push his political view. Another correspondent defended Mr Moss's political site, saying it was non-partisan.<br>The site called Australian politics provides links to political parties and organisations as diverse as the League of Rights and the Australian Republican Movement.<br></font></p>
