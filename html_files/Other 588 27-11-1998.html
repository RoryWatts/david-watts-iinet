            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Hubble space telescope has found thousands of previously unknown galaxies, it was revealed this week. They are 12 billion light-years away in the constellation Tucana near the south celestial pole.<br>Although it will take perhaps squillions more years to find if there is any life in these galaxies, many parents will not be surprised if they are entirely inhabited by 10-year-old boys.<br>Until a fortnight ago I believed the noisiest, messiest creature on this planet - indeed this galaxy - was the nine-year-old boy.<br>Then my son turned 10.<br>This happy event signals one of the greatest bacchanalian orgies to survive ancient Roman times . . . the sleepover party. Sleepover is, of course, an oxymoron that ranks with childproof and rap music.<br>About 10pm the little aliens had got themselves ready for sleep by drinking massive amounts of sugary drinks, eating salty takeaways and watching scary movies.<br>They then decided to relax further by playing a quiet game of hoppo-bumpo. They didn't call it that; it was something like Bloodsucking Alien Demolition. But I know a game of hoppo-bumpo when I see it.<br>The 10-year-olds pulled their sleeping bags on, right over their heads, and started bouncing into each other while making bloodcurdling screams.<br>It was enough to cause my wife and I - the gimlet-eyed chaperons - to flee to the veranda as alien after alien leapt into each other with thuds and groans, and crazy laughter.<br>The upshot of all the hoppo-bumpoing was the winners got to dare the losers to do something outrageous.<br>I had to physically restrain my wife when one of the dares turned out to be throwing lollies into the revolving fan blades overhead.<br>?Darling,? I said, ?just be thankful they are only 10. In another decade they'll be sitting around chanting, "Who put the cookie in the cookie jar', and daring each other to eat live goldfish.<br>?Then 10 years after that some innocent girl will have fallen for their charms and they'll be raising little potential aliens of their own. And 10 years later, they will be running the country and the banks and ripping off aged pensioners (aka their parents) with exorbitant fees simply because they're not techno whizzes who routinely operate ATMs and EFTPOS outlets.?<br>She listened patiently, nodding at these wisdoms every now and then . . . but still went into the alien compound and ordered a halt to the chucking-the-lollies-into-the-fan caper . . . and hoppo-bumpo . . . and wrestling - any unsavoury 10-year-old activity as a matter of fact (it would have been exhausting for her to list them all).<br>So they stopped. And started jumping off the end of the veranda on their skateboards.<br>I forgot to mention that the aliens of the galaxies in the Tucana constellation will not only be 10-year-old boys, but 10-year-old boys who skateboard.<br>If you are not familiar with skateboarding 10-year-olds count yourself lucky. Dennis Lillee with a head of steam, Tony Lockett moving like a Mack truck for a mark, Mike Tyson in best ear-biting form . . . creampuffs. They don't stand a chance against 10-year-old skateboarders.<br>The aliens fly through the air, they roll up and down, up and down, they collide with everything, they tumble, they sprawl, they come gutsers; sometimes they just fall off.<br>All to roars of encouragement and puffed-out chests of boastfulness, and all in a language that is impossible for anyone - bar other skateboarding aliens - to understand.<br>Recently a particularly gorgeous GYM (gorgeous young mum) friend took two such aliens to a skate shop to buy some goodies. She had to flee in horror because nothing, least of all her own son and his mate, made the slightest bit of sense.<br>The boys actually hid among shelves at the far end of the shop rather than be associated with her and her innocent questions about decks, bearings, ollies and whatever.<br>The new galaxies can wait. Until then, please don't beam me up Scotty.<br></font></p>
