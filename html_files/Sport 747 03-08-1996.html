            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EVEN Superman has normal parents. Michael Johnson obviously changes into his US track uniform and those gold shoes in a phonebox.<br>After he ran into stellar history in 19.32sec. to win the 200m yesterday - completing the toughest athletics double - Johnson gave a few seconds of his precious time to Channel 7's Pat Welsh.<br>The fastest man on Earth smiled and lingered longer than in previous perfunctory chats with the affable Brisbane rugby league commentator.<br>But he still strode off mid-question to leave Welsh mumbling. I suppose he is always in a hurry. No one has run as fast or won so easily before. And Johnson does it all with the upright running style of a gentleman of the Victorian era.<br>Jane Flemming said his 19.32 was worth a 9sec. 100m, and she and Bruce McAvaney thought the record would stand for a long time.<br>In comparative terms, Johnson's record is probably equivalent to Bob Beamon's 8.90m long jump at Mexico in 1968. That came out of the blue and was not beaten for 23 years.<br>Johnson will be the only athlete to go near his mark for many years.<br>After his little chat with Welsh, Johnson's parents fronted up, beaming and proud.<br>They were such normal people after his majesty; down to earth and friendly. It is plain to see Michael came to them by unconventional means - a small spaceship from a dying planet landing in Texas is not out of the question.<br>How does Welsh get these trackside coups? He is so friendly it seems he will talk to anyone, and they to him.<br>Maybe he has a sign over his commentary spot that says ?talk to me and win?, rather than ?win and talk to me?.<br>Johnson could have run 5000m in the time it took to present the Hockeyroos with their marvellous gold medals.<br>Handing out that much gold is a big task and the presenter was wise to wimp out on the kissing. I think he would have expired with exhaustion halfway through the Korean silvers.<br>The hockey was wonderful and the coverage okay with more action than usual. Seven has not done well with the sport at these Games, missing more goals than the Dockers forward line.<br>This time they got it right.<br>THE Seven cameras also gave us an eyeful of the Nightmare Team drubbing a gallant Boomers in the basketball semi-final. It was exciting up to half-time, with the millionaires fighting to earn their big salaries.<br>Late on Thursday night all Seven could give us was Emotive Tumbling and Juggling by Pretty Girls. The rhythmic gymnastics is to sport what Don Scott is to impartiality.<br>It had to fight for sports-minded viewers against Channel 9's Footy Show.<br>No contest, especially with Trevor Marmalade telling jockey Darren Gauci that he would improve the odds by doing a Kieren Perkins and shaving his horse.<br></font></p>
