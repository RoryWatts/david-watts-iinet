            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE ASSIGNMENT<br>Even though Carlos the Jackal is safely behind bars it doesn't stop Hollywood from making yet another movie about the world's most notorious terrorist. This one involves a plot to discredit and kill Carlos by convincing the Russians that their most effective operative is disloyal. The CIA plans to pull off this stunt by training an American Carlos look-alike, a naval officer named Ramirez (Aidan Quinn), and then have the double persuade his communist sponsors that he cannot be trusted, prompting the KGB to bump him off. To help Ramirez hone his act, CIA boss Donald Sutherland assigns an Israeli named Amos (Ben Kingsley) to use psychological tactics to persuade the reluctant sailor to leave his wife and children to become a counter-terrorist. Rated MA (not previewed)<br>GOING ALL THE WAY HHH12<br>It's an old story - young men returning from the war and having trouble plunging back into a normal life - but first-time director Mark Pellington freshens up this familiar material with some eye-catching MTV-inspired visuals and a lively, spot-on period soundtrack. Based on a 1970 best-selling novel by Mark Wakefield (who also provides the screenplay), Going All The Way is set in the summer of 1954 just as the Korean War was ending. Two of those young veterans are the nerdy photographer Sonny (Jeremy Davies of Spanking the Monkey fame) and his popular jock friend Gunner (Good Will Hunting's Ben Affleck). Together they plan a future in New York City where they'll meet up with more exotic women than they'll ever find in their sleepy corner of Indiana. Those plans go astray when Gunner meets the girl of his dreams right there in town (Rachel Weisz from the just-out Swept From the Sea) and Sonny is drawn to Weisz's wild and sexy best friend (Rose MacGowan). At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>LUCIE AUBRAC HHH12<br>Two of France's most appealing stars, Daniel Auteil and Carole Bouquet (of Too Beautiful For You fame), are brought together by Claude Berri (Jean de Florette, Germinal) to tell the true-life tale of Raymond and Lucie Samuel, a husband-and-wife team who were active in the French underground during the nazi occupation. When Raymond is arrested in Lyon in 1943 along with Jean Moulin, to whom General de Gaulle had delegated the task of unifying the resistance, the grimly determined Lucie (who goes under the pseudonym Aubrac) hatches an elaborate plot that depends on fooling Gestapo officers into believing she's pregnant and needs to marry the condemned prisoner (her husband, naturally) as soon as possible. While Berri's film is not as exciting or melodramatic as others of the genre, Lucie's overwhelming love for her husband makes this a more accurate depiction of why people act heroically in appalling situations than all that flag-waving and Marseillaise-singing. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>MR MAGOO<br>When this live-action remake of the 1960s cartoon about a myopic millionaire was released in the US it stirred the wrath of the National Federation of the Blind, compelling Disney to include a disclaimer about the sightless being able to lead satisfying lives and so on. If the US reviews are anything to go by - "It ranks slightly above plastic doggie poo and slightly below a rubber chicken,? sniffed Rita Kempley of The Washington Post - the only thing the film-makers have to worry about is the audience turning a blind eye to the bumbling blind man. The plot involves Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) being an innocent bystander during a jewel heist. Mistaken for the thief, he is pursued by the standard-issue CIA and FBI goons while never quite grasping what trouble he's in. Curiously, Mr Magoo opens a week after The Man Who Knew Too Little, starring Bill Murray, which is also about a bungler everyone assumes to be a master underworld operator. Rated PG (not previewed)<br>TWILIGHT HHH<br>It's nice to see Paul Newman still gracing the screen at the age of 73 but perhaps it's time he took some grandfather roles rather rather than bedding his best friend's wife (Susan Sarandon) and running around Los Angeles, Raymond Chandler-style, trying to solve a 25-year-old murder mystery. Unlike his last film Nobody's Fool, which seemed tailor-made for Newman, this one feels too mechanical to make best use of a great star in his twilight years. For a full review see Arts Today. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>WILD THINGS HHH<br>A thriller of the most serpentine kind set in the wild and steamy surrounds of the Florida Everglades. A school counsellor and reformed womaniser (Matt Dillon) is accused of rape by two students: the local blue-blooded brat (Denise Richards) and damaged social outcast (Neve Campbell). What begins as a transparent courtroom drama with Bill Murray as defence counsel and comic relief takes a heart-stopping twist mid-way to open a pandora's box of sexual intrigue, greed, revenge and, naturally, murder. A local detective (Kevin Bacon) smells conspiracy but the story's ingenious depths continue to unfold as the end credits roll. Director John McNaughton meshes film noir elements and glossy Hollywood style to satisfying effect. Rated MA (Michael Dwyer).<br>A THOUSAND ACRES HH12<br>Described as King Lear in the cornfields, this is an adaptation of Jane Smiley's novel about a cranky old Iowa farmer (Jason Robards) who divides up his kingdom among his daughters (Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jennifer Jason Leigh), causing a family feud and the unearthing of dark secrets. The film looks pretty and the performances are heartfelt but the Australian writing-directing team of Jocelyn Moorhouse and Laura Jones have not dramatised the material sufficiently, with the story leaping from one overwrought melodramatic moment to the next. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>SWEPT FROM THE SEA HH12<br>You have to admire Beeban Kidron giving Joseph Conrad's staunchly literary tale about the convention-defying love between an eccentric outcast and a Ukranian peasant who washes up on the Cornwall coast after a shipwreck the kind of oomph and lavish visual treatment not normally associated with British costume dramas. But casting two such drop-dead gorgeous creatures as Rachel Weisz and Vincent Perez in the lead roles makes the whole thing look like a peasant-chic fashion spread in Vogue or Vanity Fair. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE BOYS HHHH<br>Less is more - that most fundamental of aesthetic principles has rarely been applied with such devastating effect as in this chilling, slow-burn Australian crime drama inspired by the shocking rape and murder of Sydney nurse Anita Cobby. Directed by newcomer Rowan Woods from a script by playwright Stephen Sewell, who adapted Gordon Graham's 1991 award-winning play, The Boys eschews the tiresome strategy of plastering the screen with viscera, choosing instead to explore the social and psychological roots of violence instead of wallowing in it. While a more routine crime yarn might have glamorised the three troubled, misogynistic working-class brothers who perpetrate the dreadful crime and the downbeat, grungy milieu in which their violence and social inadequacies were nurtured, director Woods keeps things lean, mean and ugly. Rarely has the banality of evil been so startingly portrayed. At the Luna. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE HHH<br>Bill Murray is ideally cast as an American dork who, while visiting his suave banker brother in London, confuses an experimental audience-participation play called Theatre of Life with a real-life drama in which Russians and Cold-Warmongering Brits are conspiring to blow up a peace ceremony. Director Jon Amiel (The Singing Detective) keeps the laughs coming, while the support cast of Peter Gallagher, Joanne Walley and Alfred Molina do their bungling bit for a movie that rides a running gag and flogs it almost to exhaustion. Art movie it ain't. Artful entertainment, well, why not? Rated PG (Patrick Cornish)<br>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION HH12<br>A pregnant woman being in love with her gay flatmate and best friend is a cute idea, opening the way for a very timely examination of what's missing in contemporary relationships, straight or gay. But this is a mainstream romantic comedy, starring Jennifer Aniston (of Friends fame) and Clueless' Paul Rudd, which means there's never the possibility that the two leads would make love (too perverse, too politically incorrect if she ?cures? him), denuding the film of all sexual tension. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>AFTERGLOW HHH<br>This romantic farce about two unhappily married Montreal couples who accidentally swap partners is pure Alan Rudolph - ambitious, eccentric, adult and very sexy but wildly uneven. What cannot be faulted are the luxuriant performances of Julie Christie as the depressed former horror-movie star and Nick Nolte as her randy handyman husband. These veterans glow so bright we have to squint to see their young co-stars Lara Flynn Boyle and Johnny Lee Miller. At the Windsor and Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BLUES BROTHERS 2000 HH12<br>The vast army of people who revere the original Blues Brothers will be disappointed with this vapid and timid sequel. While the original crackled with creativity, energy and laughs the latest instalment lacks nearly everything. But the music is to die for, with a supergroup consisting of B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Clarence Clemons, Stevie Winwood, Dr John, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Billy Preston and Isaac Hayes providing one of the great musical moments to grace the screen. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY HHHH<br>After the sweet inconsequentiality of his most recent films Woody Allen has descended into the dark night of his artistic soul and given birth, kicking and screaming, to a self-centred, pill-popping, skirt-chasing, foul-mouthed novelist named Harry Block. Bitter, black and drenched in self-loathing, this portrait of The Meanest Man on Earth (Allen's original title for the movie) is the writer-director's most original and envelope-pushing work for at least a decade. At the Windsor and Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>FOR RICHER OR POORER HH<br>Despite starring two of America's most popular TV actors, Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley, this comedy about a rich and unhappy Manhattan couple forced to hide out in Amish country is not funny. Not even Alley's extravagant gestures and Allen's screwed-up face can milk much more than a smile out of this lame effort. Rated M (Pam Brown)<br>LOST IN SPACE HHH<br>There's danger, Will Robinson! at every turn as the space-age scientific family (headed by William Hurt and Mimi Rogers) set out to colonise a new planet with Earth facing extinction. Witty one-liners keep the dialogue alive while amazing special effects steal the show. If the 1960s TV show was camp, this one is pure corn. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>MERCURY RISING HH12<br>There's a half-decent idea in Mercury Rising - an autistic young maths genius becomes the target of US government agents after cracking a billion-dollar encryption system. But this quickly evaporates as the film falls back into depressingly familiar action-thriller mode. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK HH12<br>The famous musketeer cry of unity ?All for one and one for all? is uttered no less than seven times during this latest adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of two kings in the France of Louis XIV. However, the only ones not listening seem to be the film-makers themselves, who yank the film in too many directions at once. It's energetic and never dull but fails to establish a style that allows the audience to be swept up by this rousing romantic tale. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING HHH12<br>Acclaimed novelist Richard Flanagan should be applauded for attempting a serious, European-styled art movie about the generational after-effects of World War II. It uses a complex structure to trace the story of a young woman of Slovenian heritage (Kerry Fox) who returns to her native Tasmania to uncover the dreadful secret of her mother's disappearance. Unfortunately, the various pieces don't add up to an emotionally satisfying whole. At the Astor. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>GALLIVANT<br>Something special this week at the Cinematheque - a new feature-length docu-drama about a film-maker who travels the coast of Britain in a camper van, taking with him his 85-year-old grandmother and seven-year-old daughter. The girl suffers from Joubert's Syndrome, which hampers her walking and restricts her power of speech. ?Gallivant is that rare thing,? according to Sight and Sound, ?a celebratory film that never turns sugary or mawkish.?<br>nThe National Cinematheque is on each Saturday afternoon at the Cinema Paradiso. For details of tickets and times consult the Palace Cinemas ad in Saturday's West or phone 9227 1771.<br></font></p>
