            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 7 has the rights to the National Soccer League but does not show it on free-to-air TV. Seven's cable channel C7 pumps the soccer finals to pay-TV stations Optus and Austar, neither of which can be seen in WA.<br>If Sandgropers wanted to see Perth Glory hang on for the scoreless draw against Adelaide City on Sunday, they had to settle for the ABC's delayed telecast.<br>I have my own theory about Seven's soccer reluctance. It came to me in a dream at the weekend. Actually it was a nightmare. It went like this.<br>Channel 7 producer: We need to show the Glory but save some money in the process. We will have to call on the AFL commentators. Let's audition them; first we'll try Mick McGuane.<br>McGuane: I seen them Glory players with their terrific leg speed. They'll score here if the tall forwards lead into the open. This will allow the small crumbers to follow in the space and get front and square to the contest to exert scoreboard pressure.<br>Producer: Not sure what you mean Mick, next please.<br>Ian Robertson: The Glory have pumped the ball down to their big talls - and tall players don't get any shorter. Hang on, umpire you cannot be serious. What's happened to this game?<br>Producer: We already have a referee basher thank you. Your chance Mr McAvaney.<br>Bruce McAvaney: Oh, it's a special ball played by Big John Markovski and it's falling for Bobby Despotovski. Bobby, Bobbbbbyyyy ... Oh, it's off to the left. You know, I reckon Carey would have kicked that.<br>Producer: That'll be enough of that. Come on, next please.<br>Dennis Cometti: Like a cork in the ocean, Rob Trajkovski keeps bobbing along. And like a cork in the ocean Scott Miller keeps bobbing along. And Despotovski, like a cork ... Producer: Dennis, they all do that in this game. We'll try KB.<br>Kevin Bartlett: Pass is a poor one, but Trajkovski's got it and away he goes to weave some magic. It's Trajkovski, Trajkovski, Trajkovski ...<br>Producer: Actually it was Despotovski.<br>KB: Is he from Victoria?<br>Producer: Your go, Sandy.<br>Sandy Roberts: A nailbiter here at Hindmarsh folks. Big John's got it, delivers to Bobby, across to Scotty, but whoa, he's put it out on the full after copping a push in the back. Whadya reckon Dipper?<br>Robert Dipierdomenico: Can't pronounce their names, Sandy.<br>Producer: Off you go, you two. I reckon we should try some of the Nine boys. Can't be any worse.<br>Eddie McGuire: These Glory boys would be welcome at Victoria Park any day of the week.<br>Producer: No thanks, Eddie.<br>McGuire: Can I just plug my other shows then?<br>Producer: No.<br>McGuire: What about the Crown? Holden?<br>Producer: Mr Newman please.<br>Sam Newman: Adelaide and Perth ... who gives a fat rat's ...<br>And then I woke up.<br></font></p>
