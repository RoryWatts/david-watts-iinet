            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE is one sure thing in life. It is death. The human race has a 100 per cent mortality rate.<br>And the Grim Reaper has been making quite a point lately by scything through enough big names to make it perfectly clear, that no matter who we are, one certain fate awaits us.<br>Why so morbid? Well I'm not really. In fact my mind was tuned to this once-taboo issue recently while eavesdropping on a conversation on the Internet. On the Net they call it lurking, which sounds a little too sinister, but never mind.Here are some edited extracts of the cyber-chatter. The names have been left out to protect the innocent: ?Argh! All the famous people are dying. Diana, Mother Teresa, John Denver and some other people I forgot.? (The writer probably meant authors James Michener and Harold Robbins and Australian comedian Noel Ferrier).<br>A response: ?Don't forget, each generation has a 100 per cent mortality rate! So far anyway.?<br>Another retort: ?Yah . . . I have no plans of ever dying. Just doesn't seem to fit in well with my schedule. No. I'm sorry. I'll leave things like dying up to those mortals who believe everything that the doctors and nurses tell them.?<br>He was quickly put in his place by this: ?You're so inflexible.?<br>Actually this flippant approach to death is not a bad way to approach the subject. If it's going to happen, and it is going to, why not assign it similar levities that we give other parts of life like TV, music, politics, footy and so forth?All can be taken seriously despite the immense pool of humour surrounding them.<br>It is well to remember that even the dying often have a zest for life that would shame people who regard some salty takeaway and a night in front of Blue Heelers as living.<br>IT has been my privilege to mix with people in the late twilight of life. Sometimes it is sad; they are tired and weak and unable to cope.Often it is funny; many may have lost a lot physically, but have wonderful sparkles in their eyes.Overall, it is just another part of life that has to be lived.<br>Two conversations with very elderly gentlemen facing death certainly brightened my feelings about life.The first man was wheelchair-bound and about 80. He wheeled himself out for a chat and had to come down a slight slope to do so.For the frail even little inclines can be nerve-racking in a wheelchair.<br>But no. This bloke pushed harder and even shouted ?Wheee? as he accelerated towards the table where we were planning to talk.<br>Just in time he applied the brakes to stop himself catapulting into the carpark and turned around smiling as if to say: ?That was great.?<br>We looked out on to the carpark and beyond it the gleaming towers of Perth on a perfect day.?Gee, I'd like one of those,? he said to me. ?What, a new car?? I asked slightly perplexed. ?No, the nurses. They're so pretty, I'd like to keep one as a pet.?<br>It certainly wasn't politically correct, but so what.<br>Pets and women also figured in the conversation I had with a second man, who at 89 and nearly blind, might have been considered washed-up.He was patting my dog and admiring that species' wonderful talent for loyalty and friendship.<br>?You know, one day they'll make wives more like dogs,? he said.?I beg your pardon?? said I, failing to quite comprehend what he was on about. ?Well wouldn't it be great if a wife was more like a dog and the later you got home, the happier she was to see you.?<br>Not a lot wrong with this bloke's attitude to life.<br></font></p>
