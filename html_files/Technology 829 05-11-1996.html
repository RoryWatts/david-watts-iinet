            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet is a super warehouse of software, easily beating for sheer size, choice and availability any shop in the real world.<br>US Net company c-net has added to the choice with the addition of download.com to a cyber empire that includes shareware.com, news.com, search.com and c-net TV, seen on Channel 7 in Perth on Saturday mornings.<br>Download.com is a far easier site to use, particularly for newer surfers, than shareware.com.<br>The latter required a user to know the program they were looking for, enter it in a search, then comb through possibly hundreds of choices to find what they were looking for.<br>Download.com is far easier by contrast. It offers users the choice of looking for software for Windows95, 3.1 or Macintosh. The programs are assembled in nine categories and each program carries a brief description.<br>C-net employees apply a ?pick? icon to programs they consider good. At the moment every program also carries a ?new? icon because the site is barely a fortnight old.<br>The number of times a program is downloaded is logged, and a ?pop? icon is added to the most popular.<br>Downloading instructions are simple and there is occasionally a choice of sites to download from, depending on availability of the program.<br>Most download sites are in the US, but if the example of shareware.com is followed there will be Australian choices.<br>Each site is rated for reliability, based on traffic congestion, ease of access and correct identification of the program - few things are more maddening than to discover the program you want does not exist in the folder at the FTP site you have clicked on.<br>Download.com offers programs in the following categories: business, development tools, education, games, home and personal, Internet, kids, multimedia and design, and utilities.<br>Most categories are then split into several sub-categories, some of which can occupy a dozen Web pages.<br>Like most software repositories, the section for HTML editors is big and bound to grow more.<br>Although it is extensive and comprehensive, download.com still has flaws. WestWeb could not find one of the most essential and popular programs on the Net, WinZip, for example. At least download.com offers the chance to look with its inbuilt search engine.<br>A well written, simple FAQ at the site teaches new users the best way to download.<br>?Luckily, downloading is easy to understand,? it says, then offers an easy-to-follow, six-step guide. ?Use a special download directory; find the software; download the software; decompress the archive; install the software, and delete the compressed file.?<br>C-net has supplied an on-site toolkit and several utilities to help further, particularly with the management of downloaded files.<br>Download.com appears to be a worthy addition to the big software warehouses on the Net. It still has a way to go to compete with Tucows (The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software) for speed and program range; or the Consummate List of Winsock Appliances for its expert choices, fast mirrors and in-depth reviews.<br>However, it is a worthy complement to other good sources like the Beyond the Black Stump site and Windows95.com.<br>But when downloading from the Net be sure to check local sites first.<br>Often your provider will have a download area, storing popular software like Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Communication's Navigator.<br>Many providers are also offering game demos and shareware, like Quake and Command and Conquer levels, so be sure to check the sites closest to home for maximum transfer rates.<br></font></p>
