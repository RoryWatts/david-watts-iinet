            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">OLDTIME Unix hands will instantly recognise the latest Internet toy for what it is - a Windows update of the old favourite, Talk.<br>ICQ, a play on the words I Seek You, allows a Net user to communicate online with only those he or she wants to, and identifies when those people are logged on.<br>The Israeli program is in free beta release for Windows95 and is well worth the trouble of downloading and playing with.<br>Advantages it has over other communications applications are that, unlike Internet Relay Chat, it allows chat or message sessions only with those you specify; and, unlike e-mail, you know when the person you want to talk to is connected.<br>So you get to the point and save time and frustration.<br>The program can be configured to load immediately you log on to the Net. It shows which of a pre-determined group of people are logged on too, then allows either two-way chat sessions, messaging, game playing or cooperative surfing.<br>It also allows you to use external Internet applications for phone and video conferencing through built-in support for clients like Internet Phone, Microsoft NetMeeting, WebPhone, IRISPhone, VDOPhone, CU-SeeMe, CineVideo, Netscape CoolTalk, and more.<br>There must be something in the air in Israel, because this is the second major internetworking communications program to come from the Jewish State. The first, which has caused many a peptic ulcer in the stomachs of telco bosses, was Internet Phone. IPhone allowed people to make long distance phone calls over the Net for the price of a single call to an ISP.<br>ICQ will even notify you and automatically update itself when support is added for new external clients.<br>It sits in the background and will flash from the system tray when another user wants to chat or has left a message.<br>ICQ can be put in away mode, a bit like placing a do not disturb sign on the door, if a user wants to surf without interruption. Other users can still leave messages.<br>Built-in are handy facilities like FileDirect (a powerful module for transferring files), Message Direct (saves and stores messages for you when you're offline), URLDirect (for exchanging Web bookmarks), an online search engine and the use of FileDirect servers (personal file servers that you can set up so others can freely browse and download files).<br>ICQ can be annoying if not used properly. For example, users who leave themselves logged on but are away from the computer and forget to go into away mode, cause frustration for those trying to open a chat session.<br>The 1.2Mb compressed program can be downloaded from:<br>www.mirabilis.com<br></font></p>
