            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A US report has damned Internet filtering software which impressed Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston and is poised to be used by hundreds of Australian schools.<br>The report by the Censorware Project accuses the software of allowing access to pornography sites while blocking inoffensive content.<br>The software program is known in the US as Bess and was developed by the N2H2 company. In Australia, Net reseller Infopro has rebranded it with the name iFILTER.<br>Infopro Technologies Pty Ltd has signed a deal with Schoolsnet Australia for installation of iFILTER in State and Catholic schools. In the US, about 8000 schools use Bess.<br>In March, Senator Alston said on radio that iFILTER was among software that ?really opens your eyes?. He had been told it could guarantee users clean sites. N2H2 claimed the senator had endorsed its product. But at the weekend Senator Alston's office denied the Minister's comments amounted to endorsement of iFILTER/Bess.<br>The Censorware Project, which campaigns against any form of Net censorship, released a detailed online report about Bess last Wednesday under the title: Passing Porn, Banning the Bible.<br>In it, software developer Jamie McCarthy warned Web users that the report contained many links to porn sites - most with obvious, sex-related names and URLs - which were not blocked by Bess.<br>The group also found that Bess blocked a substantial number of innocuous sites. These included a version of the Bible compiled by Thomas Jefferson, a site on Darwin and evolution, and sites dealing with issues as diverse as Serbia, baseball, psychiatry and celibacy.<br>Also blocked were a family and child mediation service approved by the Australian Federal Attorney-General, the Institute of Australasian Psychiatrists, the entire sites of several Australian Internet service providers, including hosted business and personal Web pages, information about Catholics helping street kids, and sites for children.<br>Many anti-censorship sites were also blocked, including that of Perth woman Bernadette Taylor.<br>Ms Taylor has run a strong campaign against Australia's Net censorship laws due to be introduced on January 1, and has posted details of government e-mail addresses found looking at offensive sites.<br>Mr McCarthy said the report showed the Net was unable to be filtered.<br>?Recent statistics indicate that there are about 800 million pages on the Web, a number which grows by leaps and bounds every week,? he said.<br>?N2H2 claims that Bess blocks eight million of them, a small fraction. Anyone who claims that censorware is a substitute for parental supervision is selling you a bill of goods.?<br>The report was highlighted by Australian online free-speech campaigners Electronic Frontiers Australia as more justification for its stance against Net censorship.<br>EFA spokesmen agreed with Censorware's observation that schools installing a filtering product should expect that it would ?at the very least? block hard-core porn sites.<br>But Bess/iFILTER had let through a shocking number of hard-core sites.<br>?Senator Alston has apparently been hoodwinked,? said EFA executive director Darce Cassidy. ?During a radio interview in March, he informed listeners nationwide that eight and a half million Web sites had been classified and said that the distributors of Bess/iFILTER can "guarantee you clean sites'.?<br>The Censorware report points out that products like iFILTER/Bess miss so many porn sites because of the size and rate of growth of the Web.<br>EFA says the Web contains more than one billion pages and two million pages (about 25 new pages per second) are being added every day.<br>?If you can read and rate an entire Web page in 30 seconds, you would need another 749 people just like you simply to keep up with the new information. Of course, you'd have to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week,? EFA said in a press release last Friday.<br>Senator Alston's office said the Minister had always encouraged parents and guardians to investigate various filters and use only those they believed best suited their purposes.<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority's Family Web site had plenty of information about filters.<br>The senator's office also attacked EFA saying its comments were not worth considering because they were often misleading.<br>The stoush comes after the Federal Government agreed to beef up Internet censorship in a bid widely seen as attracting Senator Brian Harradine's vote on key Telstra legislation.<br>Many foreign governments, including the US, have been moving toward stricter Net regulation.<br>Industry bodies argue they should not be responsible or suffer economic penalties for removing other people's illegal material posted on the Internet.<br>Help Desk<br>Censorware Project Report:<br>censorware.org/reports/bess<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia:<br>www.efa.org.au<br></font></p>
