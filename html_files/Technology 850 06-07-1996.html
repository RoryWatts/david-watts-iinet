            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Australian Broadcasting Authority's recommendations to go easy on Internet censorship, and Senator Richard Alston's acceptance of them, represent a return to family values and individual responsibility.   The ABA's call for parental supervision, self-censorship and an industry code of practice puts the regulatory ball at the feet of Australia's one million Net users.<br>It is a move away from government intervention and sends a message to politicians to tread cautiously in areas they know little about and which have the potential to change society for good.<br>ABA chairman Peter Webb has led a probe that has put much thought into the rapidly changing world of technology and its influence on the public.<br>Mr Webb telegraphed the ABA findings in two speeches this year in which he emphasised the global power of the Net as a place for the free exchange of ideas.<br>But he also observed the need for the community to have standards and to try to minimise the harmful effects of some of the material on the Net.<br>The ABA appears not to have bowed to hysterical outcries that would have us believe the Net is just a sewer of pornography.<br>Its report acknowledges that bad things happen in the best places. The exponential growth of the Internet means more and more prying eyes will see things they do not like.<br>There is pornography on the Net, and bad language, and racist rubbish.<br>There is also the Bible, the Koran, Shakespeare and Leonardo da Vinci.<br>The good things outnumber the bad about 9-1, a figure one United States survey says is changing rapidly as the Net becomes a source of information for more women and families.<br>A government putting its spoke in to determine what people see is not following the spirit of freedom of exchange of information.<br>Adults setting standards for children, that is parents regulating the Net, is a return to family values of the most fundamental and far-reaching kind.<br></font></p>
