            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FOR some unknown reason I love lists. I suspect it is a form of time-wasting wrapped in a thin veneer of creativity and pretending to be half intelligent.<br>You know the sort of thing - 10 best movies, 10 worst TV shows, five great left-handed ping-pong players.<br>All this year I have been able to indulge this love of lists courtesy of the Internet and the BBC. The Beeb has been running a millennium poll. Each month a panel of experts in a chosen field such as sport, comedy or music, has drawn up the top 10 in that category. Then visitors to the site have been asked to annoint their chosen one.<br>It has led to some interesting results. The greatest star of stage or screen, according to popular vote in June, was Amitabh Bachchan.<br>Amitabh who? You may well ask. He is India's number one actor; hero of what is known as Bollywood, and has appeared in more than 100 films over three decades.<br>Bachchan beat Sir Laurence Olivier into second place with Sir Alec Guinness and Charlie Chaplin in third and fourth. Fifth spot went to Homer Simpson . . . I am not making that up.<br>Greatest musical composer was the subject in April. The experts settled on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, just ahead of Johann Sebastian Bach.<br>But the public went for a living legend, a 56-year-old Englishman who gave us Hey Jude and The Long and Winding Road, not to mention Yesterday, said to be the world's most popular song, recorded by more than 2200 artists - and also murdered nearly every night in cheap piano bars throughout the globe.<br>Yes, Paul McCartney relegated Mozart to second and Bach to third. Then came Ludwig van Beethoven, John Lennon, Frank Zappa and Prince (or the rock star formerly known as Prince as he became to be known . . . formally).<br>The accolade for greatest sportsman went to Muhammad Ali. Our Don Bradman was sixth. William Shakespeare was greatest writer, Johannes Gutenberg (he of the printing press) was greatest inventor, nudging out Leonardo da Vinci, but da Vinci picked up the prize for greatest artist.<br>Last month, Spike Milligan topped the table as greatest comedian of the millennium. It was a close race. But the man who made insanity respectable with his Goon Show scripts, and whose poem On The Ning Nang Nong was voted Britain's most popular verse last year, triumphed over John Cleese. Some voters sent in e-mails to say they had nearly voted for Cleese but now he had found happiness in his life, he wasn't as funny.<br>Then came Billy Connolly, Charlie Chaplin, Rowan Atkinson, Peter Cook, Laurel and Hardy, Peter Sellers, Lucille Ball and Eric Morecambe.<br>Obviously it was a very English poll because there was no mention of Richard Court and his hilarious Bell Tower.<br>In May, Mahatma Gandhi pipped an illustrious field that included Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler to be voted the millennium's greatest leader. This month the search is on for the greatest thinker of the last 1000 years.<br>In neither of those last two sections was Mick Malthouse mentioned. Obviously, that it is as it should be, but it is hard to deny the impact that the Eagles coach has had in Perth in both those fields.<br>I don't know him and have never had to tangle with him at press conferences, but I have been to functions where he has been guest speaker.<br>And he has been marvellous, very motivational, quite humorous and always well prepared and knowledgeable.<br>At one function, all the blokes at the table I was on agreed that Malthouse would be a leader in whatever field he chose.<br>It's a big wrap, but he's been a big influence in WA and will be missed . . . at least until the Eagles play whoever he is coaching next year (and not even daughter Christi has been able to prise that information out of him in TV interviews).<br>Now we can get on with real life and stop compiling the list of 10 most-heard rumours about Mick Malthouse.<br></font></p>
