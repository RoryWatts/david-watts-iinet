            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FRANKLY I was bored on Australia Day. It was a case of seen eight or nine Skyshows/works, seen them all.<br>I did ride up to a high vantage point near home for a squizz, but a very drunk man tried to make friends by saying repeatedly: ?I suppose you're not going to talk to me either.?<br>I replied: ?Go away you horrible little man or I shall call the army? . . . or words to that effect and headed home halfway through the pyrotechnics.<br>Fireworks were better when you could do it yourself on Guy Fawkes night, which in my native Queensland, was held at the height of bushfire season.<br>How well I recall the simple pleasures of letting a jumping jack go leaping through the family's legs, or the looks on the faces of an uncle and aunt when their son threw their unopened bag of fireworks into the bonfire at the start of the night.<br>And it is hard to forget the scream of the ambulance as it took away the burns victims from the nearby Smith house.<br>Or the sound of the fire engines as they raced to extinguish the blazes that had sprung up around the same place.<br>Or the siren call of the police pulled up, wanting to know who had angled the milk bottles containing the rockets directly at the Smith garage.<br>Ah, those were the days of real fireworks.<br>The one-day cricket match on TV before the Skyworks should have eased my boredom.<br>After all we beat England in a bit of a thriller.<br>But without the portly, chattering frame of Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, the match lacked fireworks.<br>After the Skyworks, the tennis from Melbourne failed to alleviate the boredom, despite Venus Williams' exploding hair.<br>It might have been the heat that brought on this boredom, but I think it was because I agree with English author Martin Amis that most of these young things on centre court are hypo-<br>chondriac yuppies.<br>So the bottom line was that I was bored; bored listless . . . or something similar. I turned to my computer to read some notes and found something far more scintillating than fireworks, or Ranatunga-less cricket, or yuppified tennis.<br>Unfortunately my usual diligence in research was missing with these notes and I have no idea what date they were taken, nor from what source. However let's not let that get in the way.<br>The notes concern the most useless word in the English language. The contention is that word is haplography, which the Chambers dictionary defines as the inadvertent writing once of what should have been written twice.<br>One response to this challenge came from a calligraphy teacher, who said she found the word haplography useful. ?When concentrating on producing good letter forms it is easy to make mistakes such as writing "rember' instead of "remember',? she wrote.<br>Two people did not think haplography deserved its most useless tag. In derisive unison they pointed out the existence of the noun taghairm. This means divination; especially inspiration sought by lying in a bullock's hide behind a waterfall. Then came a torrent of uselessness (if that is a word) from another, who listed these:<br>SCAPHOCEPHALY: Having a head which is the shape of a boat. PANEITY: The state of being bread. STILLICIDE: The right to drop water on somebody else's property. HAECCEITY: Thisness, i.e. the quality of being this. CORSNED: The practice of establishing somebody's guilt or innocence by seeing whether they are able to swallow a large piece of mouldy cheese. And as if to prove the word's popularity, the writer listed good, old taghairm.<br>My boredom is on the way to being cured. Just to make sure, I'm off to Lesmurdie Falls for a spot of taghairming.<br></font></p>
