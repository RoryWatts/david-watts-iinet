            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIAN racing began with the mounted corps sent with the convicts of the first fleet.<br>Captain Arthur Phillip's first white ?settlers? of 1788 brought with them a stallion, three mares and three yearlings bought at the Cape of Good Hope on the voyage. By 1801 there were almost 250 horses in the colony.<br>Many of the soldiers were cavalrymen and they organised races. The first formal race meeting was held in Sydney's Hyde Park in 1810. Other official first race dates were 1814 in Tasmania, 1836 in WA, 1838 in Victoria and South Australia and 1842 in Queensland.<br>Early races were over long distances - up to 25km - and often run as heats with two or three starters and a final.<br>Racing grew in popularity during the early 19th century despite wild swings of favour with the ruling powers. By 1852, the first classic, the AJC St Leger had begun, soon followed by the first Derby at Flemington and, in 1861, the Melbourne Cup.<br>Bookmakers were present from the 1860s onwards, a legacy of the British background, and were licensed for the first time by the Victoria Racing Club in 1882.<br>The totalisator was first used in South Australia in 1879 but it was banned soon after and did not come to be a fixture until legalised in NSW in 1916.<br>In the early 1960s, the Totalisator Agency Board was introduced by several State governments as a way to access the huge amount of money bet off-course with illegal starting price (SP) bookies, many of them controlled by crime figures.<br>Since the introduction of the TAB betting shops and the growth of legal offcourse betting, crowds have declined at racecourses as have the holdings of legal and illegal bookmakers.<br>On any day at an Australian course, gamblers have the choice of dozens of races from all over the country, telecast live from track to track and covered by TAB betting and bookmakers.<br>Australia's major racetracks.<br>IN NSW and Queensland, horses race clockwise. All other States have anti-clockwise races.<br>Sydney: ROYAL RANDWICK - has two turf tracks, the 150-year-old course proper and the inner track which was first used for race meetings in 1996. The major track in Sydney and home of the AJC Australian Derby and the Doncaster Handicap.<br>ROSEHILL GARDENs - home of the Golden Slipper Stakes, the world's richest two-year-old race.<br>WARWICK FARM - most often used for restricted class racing midweek. Still is the stage for several top class meetings each year and hosts the group one Chipping Norton Stakes.<br>CANTERBURY - small, turning, suburban track.<br>Melbourne: FLEMINGTON - home of the Melbourne Cup. Established in March, 1840, and named after a local butcher, Bob Fleming, whose shop was nearby. A big, open course by Australian standards, it features straight sprint races up to 1200m.<br>CAULFIELD - venue for the Caulfield Cup. Established in 1859. Tight-cornered track with only a 329 metre straight.<br>MOONEE VALLEY - can be seen from the Tullamarine freeway as visitors to Melbourne travel from the airport. The smallest of Melbourne's tracks, Moonee Valley first hosted racing in 1883 and also hosts high class harness racing. Home of the Cox Plate.<br>SANDOWN - newest of Melbourne's racecourses, Sandown began operations in June 1965. Its one group one race is the 1400m C F Orr Stakes.<br>Brisbane: EAGLE FARM - Queensland's main track which runs six group one races including the Stradbroke Handicap and Brisbane Cup. Established in 1865, it is a spacious course with a long, wide home straight.<br>DOOMBEN - across the road from Eagle Farm. Smaller than many of the top grade courses in Australia, Doomben has tight bends and suits front-runners in its major events, the group one Doomben Cup and Doomben 10,000.<br>Perth: ASCOT - WA's main racecourse, Ascot is a picturesque track by the Swan and is the site of the group one events, the Perth Cup, Railway Stakes and West Australian Derby.<br>BELMONT  used most frequently as a winter racecourse. Its features are the Belmont Sprint and Winter Cup.<br>Adelaide: MORPHETTVILLE - scene of all group one racing in that city, including the Adelaide Cup and Goodwood Handicap.<br>CHELTENHAM - began as a harness racing course in the 1890s and gallop racing was gradually added to the programs. A small track with a straight of less than 300m.<br>VICTORIA PARK - tight, constantly-turning course, but flattens out into the longest straight on any circle course in Australia at 637m.<br>Canberra: CANBERRA - the nation's capital has its own racetrack in a picturesque setting. The main races are the Black Opal Stakes, run in March and used as a test for the rich Golden Slipper and the Canberra Cup, run in early October and a useful guide to Melbourne Cup chances.<br>Darwin: FANNIE BAY  venue for Darwin's carnival of racing which attracts big crowds each July-August. Unique among major raceourses in that it is a compound of dirt and oil not turf.<br>Big winners<br>While the greatest horses to race in Australia are generally considered to be past champions like Carbine, Phar Lap, Tulloch and Kingston Town, inflation has meant that Australia's highest prizemoney earners of all are more recent performers:<br>Super Impose: $5.659 million<br>Better Loosen Up: $4.774 million<br>Octagonal: $4.124 million<br>Rough Habit: $3.887 million<br>Durbridge: $3.369 million<br>Naturalism: $3.286 million<br>Horlicks: $3.210 million<br>Vo Rogue: $3.118 million<br>Sydeston: $3.106 million<br>Let's Elope: $3.100 million<br>Racing industry<br>AUSTRALIA has a racecourse for every 46,000 people. Betting turnover equates to $500 a year for every man, woman and child in the country.<br>The industry is ranked one of the nation's three leading businesses and employs more than 250,000.<br>Australian Jockey Club records for the 1995-96 season ending July 31, 1996, show:<br>Number of raceclubs: 459<br>Number of racecourses: 400<br>Race meetings: 3335<br>Races: 23,280<br>Number of individual horses which raced: 33,551<br>Total prizemoney distributed: $239.972 million<br>Prizemoney totals more than all of Europe.<br>Group And Listed Races: 540<br>Group And Listed Race Prizemoney: $64.120 million<br>Group One events: 65 with prizemoney of $29.88 million.<br>Foals bred: 17,077<br>Mares registered with Australian Stud Book: 30,592<br>Number of stallions standing: 1737<br>Attendances: 5,585,458.<br>On and off track totalisator betting: $6.589 billion<br>On-track bookmaker betting: $1.493 billion<br>Biggest prizes<br>ELEVEN races have total stakes of $1 million or more:<br>The Melbourne Cup $2.2 million<br>Golden Slipper $2m, Magic Millions $1.1 million, W.S. Cox Plate $1.5 million, Caulfield Cup $1 million, Australian Cup $1 million, AJC Australian Derby $1.25 million, Doncaster Handicap $1 million, Mercedes Classic $1 million, Blue Diamond Stakes $1 million, Stradbroke Handicap $1 million.<br>Did You Know? IF A horse is described as a ?bird? it means it is a certainty.<br>?Betting on the angora? means betting on the tote. It's rhyming slang for angora goat.<br>A bookie may say ?Ill take your goose's?. It means ?Ill take your cheque?. It's rhyming slang for goose's neck. This is particularly so if you haven't got an ?Oxford? (Oxford scholar which rhymes with dollar).<br>A monkey is $500. A spot is $100.<br>In 1903 at Moorfield Race Course in Sydney, High Flyer, Loch Lochie and Bardini dead-heated. The race was re-run, with the same result.<br>The first photo finish camera was installed at Canterbury racecourse, Sydney in March 1946.<br>The ?mail? on a racecourse refers to a tip, not necessarily a good one. It often comes from an over enthusiastic owner.<br>The weight for age system, still in use all over the world, was masterminded by one Admiral Rous. The Admiral was a great friend of Captain Standish, the man generally given credit for being behind the first Melbourne Cup.<br>Phar Lap's skeleton is kept in a glass case in his home country, New Zealand. In memory of the champion, a headstone is located at Randwick racecourse in Sydney. The gelding's body is on display at the Victorian Museum in Melbourne. The heart is kept at the old Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. It weighed about 6kg.<br>PHAR LAP (A Thai phrase meaning thunder and lightning) was the Depression-era champion which brought hope to many people down on their luck. The 17.1-hand (208cm) chestnut was almost always likely to win a punter some money.<br>Phar Lap was sired by Night Raid out of Entreaty and foaled at Timaru in New Zealand on October 4, 1926.<br>He was bought at auction by Hugh Telford on behalf of his brother Harry, a Sydney trainer, at the Trentham sales in NZ for 160 guineas.<br>Telford then convinced David Davis to buy the horse. Phar Lap was in very poor condition when he arrived in Australia at the Telford stables and Davis refused to pay for his training.<br>Telford and Davis then agreed that Telford would lease Phar Lap for three years. Telford agreed to meet all costs, while Davis would receive one third of all prizemoney.<br>Now gelded, Phar Lap made an unimpressive debut in the Nursery Handicap at Rosehill in 1929, finishing out of the money. He failed to run a place in his next three starts.<br>Phar Lap's first win was at Rosehill on April 27, 1929.<br>In a career spanning four racing seasons the champion started in 51 races, winning 37, finishing second three times and third twice.<br>He won 32 of his last 35 starts, including the 1930 Melbourne Cup at 11/8 on.<br>After finishing 8th in the 1931 Melbourne Cup, Phar Lap was taken to America where he won his first start, the Agua Caliente Handicap in Mexico on March 20, 1932.<br>This was to be Phar Lap's last race. He died on Thursday April 5, 1932 at Menlo Park near San Francisco. Grief, disbelief and anger were widespread in Australia where Phar Lap was regarded as a legend.<br>The Sydney Mail commissioned A.B. (Banjo) Paterson to write the paper's tribute.<br>Phar Lap won 39,000 pounds in prizemoney which equates to more than $7 million in today's values, much more than modern horses have won, and on a par with the other greats of Australian racing, Tulloch and Carbine.<br></font></p>
