            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LIFE is precious. Every minute counts. In nine of them you can do a lot - save Lois Lane from the ticking bomb, or change the course of a game of football.<br>Superman Wayne Carey did not save Lois at Subiaco Oval on Sunday, but in less than nine minutes he swung the crucial AFL battle against West Coast to North Melbourne's advantage.<br>Would the Eagles respond? Would they claw back and unearth their own Superman?<br>The last nine minutes would prove crucial.<br>If you could see it. But Channel 7's delayed telecast did something it never has before ... it stopped nine minutes short.<br>And those viewers who did not know the result - and probably those who did but just wanted to see an epic struggle - were denied the chance because the computer that stored the replay hiccuped. Unfortunately, a backup system failed to notify Seven staff, and without warning it was all over ... before it was over, but some hours after it really was over (you know what I mean).<br>Viewers got to see Peter Landy sum up the match because his segment was recorded separately, then Seven managed to reassemble and play the entire second half - plus the last nine minutes - after the movie.<br>Diehards had to wait until nearly midnight for those last nine minutes.<br>Those nine minutes were nail-biters. At the ground, there was a collective air of resignation as they unfolded.<br>At the ground you can often feel how things will turn out.<br>It is in the body language of the players. Sometimes you can see it in their eyes.<br>But TV lies. TV is a temptress. Even delayed telecasts retain hope of fightbacks, particularly as the commentators ritually chant ?plenty of time left?.<br>Without the smell of the ground or the real muttering of the crowd, anything seems possible.<br>So those last nine minutes could have been dramatic viewing.<br>Taken on their own they would have shown mostly that players from both sides were running up and down on the spot and that play rebounded from half back line to half back line by way of the boundary.<br>But like the one-point Springbok win in the rugby union Test the night before, the last minutes needed to be put in the context of a tough, even brutal encounter. On TV, Australia looked a chance in the last minutes. On TV, the Eagles would have looked a rough chance, too.<br>We viewers take for granted that Seven will show lots of AFL action. In theory it is free. In practice we pay by having advertisements at every conceivable break and by having the Seven logo applied to the screen like some brand marking livestock.<br>As club memberships ensure sell-out games, TV is the only way most of us can watch the great game.<br>It looks and sounds better than it really is at times. But it fulfils a great need for entertainment.<br>And every minute counts.<br></font></p>
