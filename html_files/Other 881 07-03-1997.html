            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT'S A man's world ... bah humbug. Did you see page one of The West Australian on Wednesday? There, with all her lovely female friends, was 100-year-old Ivy Nevill, propping up the bar at the Carlisle Hotel.<br>People don't turn 100 very often and men rarely do. But women seem good at it and judging by the size and age of Ivy's little coterie, they keep their wits about them pretty well into the 70s and 80s.<br>In this ageing Australia of ours no one ages better than women. Now I have found out from the CIA - that American spy organisation that keeps tab on everyone from satellite nooks - that Australian women live to an average age of 81.04 while their men only make it to 74.67.<br>What's more, in the growing over-65 age group, women outnumbered men 1,227,004 to 934,374 in 1995. Up to the age of 64, men actually were in the ascendancy - 2.02 million to 1.93 million in the 0-14s and 6.18 million to 6.02 million in the 15-64s.<br>This statistical phenomenon is not uniquely Australian. When I lived in London in the roaring 80s, my neighbourhood was knee-deep in blue rinse.<br>Our little corner of the world was out west where the Heathrow flight path did not go over our house but the guy next door's. It was a unique neighbourhood in that everyone who owned a house in the street therefore owned a proportion of the common - a rough little park and community centre adjoining it.<br>Several times a year the whole street would have a knees-up at the centre. This always started with an inept attempt at barbecuing Spam, graduated to a few warm beers and cheap Bulgarian red, then culminated in the over-70s Fitness Group display. This was more often than not a performance of the Chicken Dance or aerobics, or both. It was hard to tell. All the over-70s Fitness Group were women.<br>A ND all 20-30 dashing, cardigan-wearing ladies were firm friends. They had moved to the street as GYMs (gorgeous young mums) in the 30s with their husbands. But every chap had shuffled off his mortal coil at least two or three years earlier.<br>So, what is it with us blokes? Why can't we stand the pace? Theories abound of the pressure of making a living, too many sedentary pursuits, weak genes that lead to violence, homicide, car accidents and football fever. On the other hand, the girls visit doctors far more often, chase kids, never sit down (thus ensuring maximum aerobic workouts) and talk to people about their problems.<br>Then of course there is the fact that women, by and large, don't marry other women and don't have the nerve-wracking task of having to answer these questions: ?What are you thinking??; ?Do you love me??; ?Do I look fat??; ?Do you think she is prettier than me??, and ?What would you do if I died??<br>An incorrect response to any of these causes untold stress and cuts a chap's longevity considerably.<br>For example, here is what not to say to ?What are you thinking?? even if what you say is the truth: a) about Greg Blewett's innings; b) Glen Jakovich's knee; c) Elle; d) Elle and Claudia Schiffer; e) pay-TV and the chance to play with a new remote.<br>To ?Do you love me??, the only answer is ?yes? but preferably ?yes, my gorgeous one?.<br>Wrong answers include: I suppose so; would it make you feel better if I said yes? that depends on what you mean by ?love?; does it matter? and who, me?<br>Try to get out of the room as quickly as possible when saying ?no? to the ?Do I look fat?? one. It's just not worth the aggro going into the lateral thinking needed to save your life. And that applies whether the woman is a drop-dead gorgeous Elle-like creature or an Amanda Vanstone clone.<br>They all think they're fat ... and someone's got to pay for it.<br></font></p>
