            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE APARTMENT ????<br>Writer and director Gilles Mimouni's debut feature is an astonishingly well-crafted and mature film. Paris has never looked lovelier or more romantic than in this contemporary tale of a young man seeking to find his lost love. He thinks he caught a glimpse of her in a telephone booth, and instead of going on a business trip to Japan, secretly decides to follow the trail. But is it his lost love he finds? Someone else seems to have usurped her place in the apartment. There are dozens of tantalising clues and mysterious incidents and coincidences that shape this love story with a twist, including a thriller element thrown in to confuse matters even further. The Apartment is told in a very clever series of time shifts between the past and the present, and keeping track of what is unfolding is a satisfying experience. It is one of the cleverest romantic comedies to come out of Paris in recent years and shows that the French can be much more sophisticated in their film-making than those ogre Americans. Screening at Luna Cinemas. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>KAMA SUTRA ???<br>Indian director Mira Nair, who came to international attention with Salaam Bombay, a tale of contemporary street kids, winds back to the 16th century in this sensual story of the erotic arts, seduction and the desire of the human heart for possession. Set within the context of the Kama Sutra, that familiar yet misunderstood manual of ?lessons in love? that were created in times of the Sufi tribes who roamed the country, Kama Sutra is a richly-crafted, lushly-coloured cinema experience. It tells the story of Maya, a servant girl who learns the art of seduction, only to find that her success in this field leads to rivalries between two men - the king whom she initially seduced and the sculptor with whom she falls in love. Shot in ancient Indian palaces, Kama Sutra is sumptuous and entrancing, with beguiling performances from its handsome actors - both male and female. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Ron Banks)<br>MOLOM ??½<br>Rarely do we get to see a film from Outer Mongolia, that strangely beautiful region of lakes and mountains where life has existed pretty much the same for centuries. Molom, a co-production between Mongolian film-makers and the French tells the story of a shaman and an orphan child who wander through its uplands and grassy slopes. There is not much of a narrative, but the way of life of Mongolian tribesman is lovingly, if rather slowly, observed. The photography is superb, but this is not a film for those who prefer action and intensity. It is more for those who like to savour exquisite scenery and ponder on the mysterious beauty of regions that always seem to lie beyond our understanding. The film is the second in Cinema Paradiso's Cine 7 season, in which audiences are introduced to a new film from a different country each week. Rated PG (Ron Banks).<br>MOTHER<br>After two divorces, sci-fi writer John Henderson (Albert Brooks) realises he has to sort out his relationship with his mother Beatrice (Debbie Reynolds) if he is to have any hope of a decent relationship in the future. So he moves back home, forcing changes not only in his relationship with his mother but also with his younger brother Jeff. This comedy, which was also directed by Brooks, marks Debbie Reynolds' first starring role in a movie in more than 25 years and she picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her effort. And watch out for Friends star Lisa Kudrow as John's date Linda. Screening at the Astor, Greater Union Innaloo and Ace Cinemas Subiaco. Rated PG (Not Previewed) PRIVATE PARTS ????<br>Howard Stern is America's No.1 ?shock jock? - a man who turns the airwaves blue with his lewd, lascivious and outrageous commentaries on the private obsessions of his fellow Americans. How he reached this position is told in this autobiographical film, in which the tousled, lanky DJ plays himself. Private Parts is really about the rise and rise of Stern from geeky college radio kid to barnstorming master of broadcasting, despite management and broadcast authority attempts to stop him. Yet Stern, as this film suggests, is really a warm, loving character devoted to his wife and kids. It is hilariously funny in places, and even the tasteless episodes have a wry irony and self-deprecating wit that will have audiences convulsing. At its heart the film is soft-centred and romantic, but there is enough inside dope on the way big-time radio operates to make it one of the more intriguing glimpses into a segment of American culture that simply does not exist here. The real winner is the First Amendment - which gives controversial figures like Howard Stern the right to say the most outrageous things and become famous for them. Rated MA (Ron Banks)<br>THE RELIC ??½<br>If you're planning on seeing The Relic because you need a good scare, don't get your hopes up. Although the first hour of this US box office hit film meets the criteria of suspense thiller, there's only so long you can remain fearful of an unseen killer running rampant in a Chicago museum, repeatedly ripping off people's heads to tuck into their brains. The Relic has the big budget feel without the big budget stars. Penelope Ann Miller is reminiscent of Nicole Kidman and Tom Sizemore is a bit George Clooney-ish. By the time the real monster reveals itself in the last quarter of the film, you'll probably be laughing. But just like Jurassic Park, the plot is open ended enough for there to be a Relic 2. Rated MA (Sue Yeap).<br>TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY ??<br>Two years after the death of his wife Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) - in a yachting accident no less - David Lewis (Peter Gallagher) is talking to her and frolicking with her on the beach like she's still alive. His sister-in-law Esther (Kathy Baker) thinks he's nuts and wants custody of his daughter Rachel. If there is a point to this film, it is lost somewhere in the heavy handed sop and sentimentality. Gallagher makes an awkward leading man and Claire Danes is wasted as Rachel, parading around in a G-string and acting drunk, badly. Only Picket Fences star Baker manages to rise above the very ordinary script. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>RECENT RELEASES<br>BLACKROCK ???<br>The lightness of touch which characterised Nick Enright's play Blackrock (on in Perth last year) is missing in the screen version of the sad story of a girl raped and killed after a surf club party. Director Steven Vidler spends less time looking at the lifestyles of the young people involved and more examining the aftermath of the killing and the way the town is divided, with some seeing the girl as ?asking for it?. The movie, based on the real-life murder of Newcastle girl Leigh Leigh, and starring Simon Lyndon as Ricko and Laurence Breuls as Jared, is bleak but very watchable. Rated MA (Pam Brown).<br>BLOOD AND WINE ??½<br>Director Bob Rafelson describes Blood and Wine as part of a trilogy of dysfunctional family studies which started with Five Easy Pieces and The King of Marvin Gardens. Given he worked on the Blood And Wine project for four years, and given a strong cast, including Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine and Judy Davis, the result is disappointing. Despite Rafelson's intention to make a brooding film noir psychological study, this has a B-grade heart. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Chris McLeod)<br>BROTHER OF SLEEP<br>Germany's Brother of Sleep is a 19th century tale of a mountain village peasant possessed of a natural talent for music and his bizarre relationship with nature. Director Joseph Vilsmaier has described his film as a study of the ?abnormal? - those who hardly ever find support in the world, yet try to live their lives with passion, feelings and courage. Brother of Sleep is one of those atmospheric art-house films with eerie locations, strangely pious peasants, a disturbing series of events and an overall sense of gloom and foreboding. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Not Previewed)<br>THE CASTLE ???<br>The Frontline team makes a smooth transition from small to big screen, using a subtle, naturalistic style to tell the tale of an Oz family so low on the evolutionary scale they make the Simpsons look like the Kennedys. Not nearly as richly layered as the average episode of Frontline - the story is so straightforward it's rather dull - but the dialogue and performances are very funny. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>DONNIE BRASCO ???<br>What is Hollywood going to do when Al Pacino is no longer with us? Who is going to play the archetypal Mafia gangster? Pacino is at it again in Donnie Brasco. Rather than a high-up heavy, he is a lowly crim in Brooklyn often reduced to robbing parking meters to keep gang bosses happy. Into his life walks Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), who we know from the first minutes is really FBI agent Joe Pistone. An endearing bond forms between the down-at-heel hitman and the cocky, young informant, who becomes a good gangster; even cutting up dead bodies of ?rivals?. Don't look for Godfather-type glamour or Goodfellas energy. This is a grim tale based on a true story. Rated MA (David Watts)<br>EXTREME MEASURES ???½<br>Hugh Grant puts away his usual soppy comic character to portray a brilliant young doctor deeply involved in a serious medical and ethical dilemma. A homeless patient dies mysteriously in front of him and then the body goes missing. Grant delves in, and what he finds is murk and controversy, as well as a God-like Gene Hackman experimenting on people who cannot defend themselves. It is a dramatic, gritty film with a theme to think about, topped off with excellent New York backdrops. Rated M (David Watts)<br>FEMALE PERVERSIONS ??½<br>Billed as ?a powerfully rich exploration of gender, sexuality, identity and self realisation,? Female Perversions doesn't fulfil these great expectations, at least not in a broad sense. On some levels the film explores how society expects women to conform to its norms, in everything from fashion and family to career and sexuality. But most of the time the focus seems rather more narrow, concentrating specifically on lawyer Eve Stephens (Tilda Swinton), a woman who seems in total control but is actually struggling with her insecurities, sexuality, her past and how each encroaches on her professional life. Screening at the Luna Cinemas. Rated R (Sue Yeap)<br>GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI ??½<br>The assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in Mississippi in 1963 and the subsequent legal shenanigans stretching over 30 years that led to the jailing of white supremacist Byron Dela Beckwith make for a strong story. Pity then that its film adaptation has fallen into the hands of Hollywood neatness and glamorisation. Director Rob Reiner focuses on the lawyer who wins the case (Alec Baldwin using the sincerity of a car salesman) rather than the family of Evers. A wooden performance by Whoopi Goldberg as Myrlie Evers does not help. But James Woods' portrayal of assassin Beckwith oozes racist nastiness. Rated M (David Watts).  MARVIN'S ROOM ????<br>Two sisters, one a frumpy spinster (Diane Keaton) and the other a head-strong single mother (Meryl Streep,) must confront unresolved family issues when the elder sister Bessie finds she is dying of leukaemia. Instead of drowning in Hollywood sentimentality, director Jerry Zaks comes up with a sensitive and humorous film that explores issues of personal sacrifice, family obligations and the power of love to heal. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>ONE FINE DAY ???<br>Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney star in this feelgood flick about a pair of headstrong single parents thrown together one rainy New York day. Everything that can go wrong does, but you just know they'll fall for each other. ER's bad boy Clooney makes up for his dismal appearance in last year's From Dusk Till Dawn. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>RETURN OF THE JEDI ????<br>The third instalment of the Star Wars special edition trilogy is not super-loaded with new special effects, but it never needed to be. Luke Skywalker's final confrontation with Darth Vader and the evil Emperor was spectacular enough in first release. The long opening at the grotesque Jabbah the Hutt's palace is peppered with remarkable new aliens, however. No matter the technology, Return of the Jedi remains heartwarming, exciting and even cute (the Ewoks provoke as many oohs and aahs as ever). Rated PG (David Watts)<br></font></p>
