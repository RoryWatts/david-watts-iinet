            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">To use a technical term: Aaaargh. Computer users throughout the world are familiar with this, although Apple Mac zealots tell me they rarely use it.<br>The majority of us - some put the figure as high as 90 per cent - like a challenge, however, and use Windows. Thus we fall prey every now and then to a piece of Microsoft bloatware that isn't half bad. This means, of course, that it isn't half good either.Today's target is FrontPage 98, the Web authoring tool that costs around the $150 mark. Access readers themselves are partly to blame for a string of expletives and other technical terms in the vicinity of my PC the other night. Several weeks ago, many wrote of the problems they have been having - no, the almost complete failure - at using FrontPage to send (or publish) their HTML pages to ISP servers.One even suggested a favourable review I had given FrontPage as an HTML editor had caused his ultimate grief with itsso-called Web server capabilities.<br>Let me be plain: FrontPage98 is one of the best WYSIWYG (What-you-see-is-what-you-get) editors on the market. Its performance in that arena compared with Adobe, Netscape, Dreamweaver (all $700 of it) and Claris make it well worth the price. I recommend it heartily.But, until last week, I had never given the Web server side of the program a second thought, and had written such. Then curiosity at your letters got the better of me. I launched FrontPage's Web Explorer and tried to create a new Web: a collection of inter-connected HTML files and images in other words.FrontPage said it couldn't do it because there was no recognised server on port 80. What? I didn't ask for it to make my humble home PC a Web server.<br>After letting fly with a few technical terms I figured, rightly, that it was trying to hook me up to the Net. Again, I didn't want to do my HTML work in cyberspace. I'm far more comfortable, and have been for two years, writing HTML in the safety of my room, checking it, then connecting and sending it via FTP to my ISP.I opted to import a Web to create a new one. Why not my existing, carefully separated folders full of HTML and images that mirror exactly the folders and files I have uploaded to the Web already? Well, I'll tell you why.FrontPage duly created my new Web, automatically calling it My New Web (very creative) and started throwing in a stack of new folders such as _personal and _vtisomething or other.My original 2.5Mb of data in two simple folders grew to 10Mb in about eight folders, most of which I know I'll never need. Afraid to delete this Web - in case I never saw my HTML again - I plugged on and opened one of my old pages in the FrontPage editor.No background image, lurid colours for the links, a stupid border around the whole page and lots of buttons I'd never seen before, plus a hole for a banner ad.<br>It took some mad hitting of keys and menu options to find that FrontPage had - unasked as usual - applied a theme to my whole site, meaning every page now bore the stupid border and lurid colours. I got rid of that slowly and returned to near-normal. Still, every time I call up a page I have to re-institute the backgrounds I put in so laboriously when learning to write HTML in Notepad in 1995.<br>A lot more has happened since while using the Web Explorer in conjunction with the editor. And, no, I cannot export my pages to my ISP either - only a handful of Australia's 700 providers have installed FrontPage extensions.<br>But the HTML editor is still doing a beautiful job on its own, so I'll stick with the side of FrontPage that isn't half bad.Meanwhile, I'll try to work out what Microsoft's game is. MS has tried to take control away from the user, it appears. By leaving so much on auto-pilot, it fails to acknowledge the truism that a computer is a lightning-fast idiot which the user controls.<br>HELP DESK<br>Survive 2000: www.survive-2000.com<br></font></p>
