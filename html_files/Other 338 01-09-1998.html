            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SORRY, but what election?<br>To the casual observer on the Internet yesterday, it looked like Prime Minister John Howard had not caught up with word of the October 3 poll.<br>Mr Howard's official Web site has a page called the PM's Desktop/What's New at which speeches, press releases and transcripts of interviews can be viewed online.<br>But not a word about the election. The curious omission, however, may be explained by the fact that Mr Howard's site is produced by the Federal Government, not the Liberal Party.<br>As soon as the poll was announced, the Government started operating in a caretaker role. Convention dictates it has no role in electioneering, therefore, no news of the poll.<br>The coalition's messages will be sold on the Net through the sites of the Liberal and National parties.<br>The Liberal Party - whose official site had barely changed since the 1996 victory - added an Election '98 section yesterday.<br>Federal Labor - whose site has been more active since 1996 and has adopted technology that allows scrolling headlines - announced: ?Australia Deserves Better: 33 Days to a Better Australia?.<br>Both parties offer Net users the opportunity to read major policies online.<br>Web addresses:<br>PM's Desktop:<br>www.pm.gov.au/ new.htm<br>Liberal Party:<br>www.liberal.org.au<br>Labor Party:<br>www.alp.org.au<br>Tax Reform (GST):<br>www.taxreform. gov.au<br></font></p>
