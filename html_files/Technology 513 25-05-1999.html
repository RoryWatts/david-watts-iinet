            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA Internet users are joining a worldwide hunt for aliens.<br>They have been downloading a program from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Web site which turns their home computers into analysis tools that read chunks of data from the world's biggest radio telescope.<br>The program, called SETI@home, was officially released last week after three years of testing.<br>It aims to add hundreds of thousands of computers around the world to help with the job of detecting signals that may come from intelligent beings in space.<br>Dozens of Perth Net users have been reporting their excitement at being part of the project to local newsgroups. They have commented on the addictive nature of watching SETI@home throw graphs and data on to their home screens.<br>They have also warned that the global experiment has chewed up computing power.<br>But the chance to be part of what Seti scientists have called a grand experiment has been too hard to resist.<br>Seti, which has been searching for intelligent alien beings since 1960, decided to step up the hunt in 1996 by harnessing the growing power of the Net.<br>The reasoning was that one big computer might miss subtle signals, whereas a small computer could do the job but take an extremely long time, leaving a mountainous backlog of unanalysed data.<br>Seti hit on the idea of using lots of small computers, all working simultaneously on different parts of the analysis. Net users had millions of small computers, most of which used their idle time to display images of flying windows.<br>The Net community did not need much convincing to lend idle computing time to Seti. Nearly 400,000 people from 96 countries registered an interest in the SETI@home project before the final software was even released last Monday. The program can be run as a screensaver which has to be connected to the Net. It can also be run more actively by users like any other application.<br>SETI@home analyses the radio signals being received by the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. The program on home computers breaks this data into small chunks - a 10 kilohertz range of wavelengths in a strip of sky visible from the telescope. It can then search the data for patterns, pinpointing irregularities that may come from alien sources.<br>Seti scientists say the data downloaded to each desktop computer take up only about 250k of memory, though the computer must have 32Mb of RAM to run the software.<br>Users can download enough data through the Internet in five minutes to keep their computer analysing for several days.<br>As the computer works on the data, the screen displays a three-dimensional graph charting the signal analysis.<br>Participants also can view maps showing where the SETI@home project is searching and who is taking part in the project.<br>When the home computer is finished with its analysis, it sends the results back to Seti scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and grabs another chunk of data.<br>Don Werthimer of Seti told the BBC last week: ?This project lets us do Seti a lot, lot faster, with 10 times more sensitivity and exploring more thoroughly the spectrum of radio frequencies we scan.?<br>Louis Friedman of the Planetary Society, which is a principal sponsor for the project, said: ?Never before has there been an opportunity for anyone, anywhere in the world, to join the scientific search for intelligent beings elsewhere in our universe.<br>?This is a grand experiment - in science, in technology and in society - a global cooperative effort at the frontiers of knowledge.?<br>HELP DESK<br>SETI@home: setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu<br>Looking for Life (Seti special):<br>www.msnbc.com/news/SPACELIFE_Front.asp<br></font></p>
