            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PSYCHOLOGISTS say there are five definite stages of grief. Thousands of WA football fans went through them all on a red and black Saturday afternoon.<br>Without leaving the loungeroom it was possible to experience denial, anger, bargaining, depression and even acceptance. Carlton fans went through the same thing on Saturday night.<br>Here were tales of two teams too far from home and too outgunned by determined opponents.<br>The stages of grief do not have to happen in set order, nor does the experience of depression, for example, preclude the feeling of anger.<br>But let's look at each stage as it applied to Saturday's Essendon-Eagles game at the MCG.<br>Denial: West Coast shouldn't have been there. It was unfair that, having finished above Essendon and beaten Carlton (remember the Bombers failed against Brisbane) that the Eagles had to travel to Essendon's de facto home and face them in a knockout game.<br>The topic was on everyone's lips last week, when Mick Malthouse made it into a weapon to start the Eagles as underdogs. Even Kevin Sheedy agreed the rule that makes one Melbourne final a must was unfair.<br>Anger: All that red and black in the 85,600 crowd was enough to stir the heart of any diehard Eagle. There were only small pockets of blue and gold. Australia's best athlete, able or disabled, Louise Sauvage, carried a little Eagles flag in the parade of Paralympians before the game.<br>Even the cover of the Football Record was predominantly black and red.<br>Bargaining: If only the umpire had awarded Sumich a free for a high tackle, instead of penalising him for holding the ball early in the first quarter.<br>If McKenna had not been hurt ... if Matera had kicked better ... if Gehrig had got in front of Hird more ... if, if, if.<br>Depression: From early in the third quarter, when big Steven Alessio became another multiple-goalkicking Bomber, and Bewick and Cockatoo-Collins ran riot off the feed of Hird and Somerville; the only way to feel was lower than a platypus' bottom.<br>Acceptance: In the end, the sight of all those waving jumpers and scarves woke even the most one-eyed Eagle to the fact that Essendon played with special character and a toughness that did not allow West Coast more than token displays of their skills.<br>You can't win if you don't kick a goal in the first quarter, or if the opposing forwards are defending harder than your hardest backs.<br>Acceptance maybe, but I still kicked the cat. We don't actually own a cat, but the next-door neighbour does.<br></font></p>
