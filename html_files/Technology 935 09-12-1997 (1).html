But it runs a good corner store too. Its online specialties are books, videos, CDs and CD-ROMs.<br>Buying is uncomplicated. You select your items and go to a virtual checkout where you are shown how to send credit card and registration details. Delivery is said to be between seven and 10 days, but shoppers are told to wait as long as 28.<br>We in Australia have to add 45 per cent to the price of goods for postage and packaging. That may take the shine off some supposed bargains but you can always read the excellent reviews that accompany the goods. Among books on sale are the Enoch Powell biography, the Faber Book of Science and My Name Escapes Me by Sir Alec Guinness. CDs range from The Boatman's Call by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds to the Beethoven Sonatas by Stephen Kovacevich. The video section has Apollo 13, Braveheart and Reservoir Dogs among many others. (DW)<br>VIDEO <> Streamland<br>As Net connections have increased in speed, so has the number of videos available to watch on the Web. Although the prospect of watching a full-length movie is still some way off, movie trailers, news clips and music videos abound.At this spin-off of the SonicNet site you can register (for free) to watch more than 100 music videos in streaming audio from the likes of Marilyn Manson, No Doubt, Helmet and more. You can also submit requests.You'll need a fourth generation browser, the Flash plug-in and RealPlayer version 4.0 or 5.0 - but they don't tell you that until after you have registered. And the faster the modem you have, the better, with 28.8Kbps the minimum option. (SY)<br>ENVIRONMENT <> BBC global warming report<br>The Kyoto conference on climate change finishes tomorrow. The big question will be: what has this gathering of world government representatives achieved? This special report by Richard Black of the BBC World Service is pessimistic in that he predicts the Kyoto summit ?will not stop the rising tide?.<br>Black's in-depth look at global warming, the symptoms, the causes and possible cures is well worth looking at. But the important thing about this site is the collection of links to a wide variety of resources on climate change generally and the conference itself. Rather than pointing you to one particular site which may or may not give a balanced view, this page gives Netizens interested in the environment a diverse choice of views. (DW)<br>MUSIC <> Sound Cellar<br>So you can't decide between the latest releases from The Verve and Oasis? Then head for Sound Cellar, an archive of CDs reviewed by UK music magazine NME.If the album you are looking for isn't listed in the latest release section, it's easy just to key in a name in the Search Archive area. But don't click on Search Archive until you have typed something over the deceptive words Look For? or you'll end up with the results of artists that might match Look For!Results are gathered by the Excite! engine and listed by confidence or subject. The former doesn't always give you the most current album first, as I found doing a search on techno artist Moby but it's still easy to find what you want.Many reviews come with RealAudio clips. You can also browse the A-Z listing, post your opinions to the message board, read what the critics recommend and, as seems mandatory these days, you can buy CDs online. (SY)<br>HUMAN INTEREST <> Starlight Foundation<br>The Starlight Foundation grants burning wishes to sick and dying children in several countries. With the opening of an Australian Web site, it has put its mission statement and several amusing diversions online.<br>The site is divided into a section for grown-ups, with information concerning the organisation and why it exists, and a section for kids with games, arts and crafts tips, and a ?friends? area. Most of the games, and devices such as the online ?radio?, use Macromedia's Shockwave technology.<br>One of the games, the Interactive Rhythm Composer, is particularly engrossing. This little Shockwave beauty has a simple series of drumbeats, bass lines and wicked samples which kids can mix up to create their own infernal techno tunes. It is limited, of course, but it's a good example of how varied Web pages can be.<br>The site also has details of coming Starlight Foundation events, through which the foundation raises the money it needs to keep going. (HC)<br>HUMAN INTEREST <> Addicted To Noise Australia<br>The publication once described in these esteemed pages as ?possibly the best music zine on the Net? has gone local. ATN Australia has features on Australian bands and local concert and CD reviews as well as a good dose of articles from its American big brother.<br>The structure of the zine is good - pages branching off a cover page, with numerous soundbites - and its status solid enough for it to snaffle interviews with the big names. ATN has a cover feature on Brisbane's Regurgitator this month - cover stories are updated monthly while reviews change much more frequently. The excellent news section is updated daily.<br>With the new emphasis on Australian bands, this site deserves to register a lot of hits. (HC)<br></font></p>
