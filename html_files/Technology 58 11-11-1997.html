            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Web can be a shocking place. Just like Darth Vader, we humans have a dark side. The rapid publication and broadcasting technology of the Web does not stop that from showing. It enhances it, in fact.<br>It pays to be aware that with 50 million users and possibly 100 million pages of HTML, the chances of landing in something you don't like are fair to middling.<br>However, no one forces you to browse pornography sites or copy bomb recipes or read racist bilge.<br>Even sites that appear disagreeable at first can actually teach you a little about human nature. I like the Web for that ability to take you out of the comfort zone into what, ironically, might be called the real world of human emotions.<br>Sick of trying to come to grips with Microsoft push technology, which promises to automate Web browsing, I opted recently to return to real surfing ? you know, just clicking on a link to see where I would end up.<br>Where I found myself was Heartless Bitches International which had coincidentally been recommended to me months ago by a young female reader. Being a sensitive 40-something soul baffled by the in-your-face attitude of cybergirls, I declined her invitation for a peek.<br>But now I'd landed at the page I thought, ?Why not?? It couldn't hurt to see what drives or enrages the hearts of these young women who have decided to make a very aggressive mark on the Web. I could tell I was going to learn a thing or two about life in the 90s almost from the first paragraph.<br>Here are a few examples from the welcome page of how heartless bitches define themselves:Do really sappy, insipid, ?always and forever? love poems make you want to puke?Does the sight of an incredibly handsome man turn you off, because so many of them have room-temperature IQs, and obnoxious or non-existent personalities?Have you run out of sympathy for your female friends who continually whine about how awful men are but then they keep dating the same kind over and over, and over again?<br>The site tells its dear readers that if they said yes to these things ?then Heartless Bitches International wants you?.<br>What they say they want to promote is: ?A world where large breasts or jeeps are not acceptable substitutes for personalities and/or brains.?<br>In their own words: ?Heartless Bitches International is not about man-hating. We don't discriminate against stupidity, arrogance, irresponsibility, bloated egos, or immaturity on the basis of gender.?<br>So, as I browsed, I realised this site was good fun, as well as good sense, using industrial-strength satire.<br>But, just as in real life, human frailty reared its ugliest head soon enough.<br>I followed a link to the I Passed for Hotgirl page, the story of a man who posed as a woman on IRC and recorded the reactions of other men.<br>On one hand, the Net can open your mind and eyes, on the other it can cause all sorts of creeps to slide into the ether. IRC seems to attract people who, for better or worse, play games with their identities and gender and try to get away with conversation they would not dare to if face to face.<br>The author of Hotgirl, James Stockford, comments: ?A lot of people love it (role playing, chatting up), most prominently single men ??<br>Stockford claims he did not try to solicit other blokes online. He merely logged on under his nickname of Hotgirl and waited for the responses ? which weren't long in coming and arrived in droves.<br>Many people behaved impeccably. They were courteous, refined, witty, interesting and, according to Stockford, interested in who Hotgirl was and not how big her breasts were. But the others ? His chronicle of the online chat-ups, propositions and plain rudeness and lewdness is fascinating.<br>Unfortunately, hardly any of it could be published in a family newspaper because the language, to put it mildly, would make a wharfie blush.<br>I am not totally sure what Heartless Bitches and Hotgirl taught me but as two little windows to a different world they were illuminating to say the least.<br>And there are millions more out there telling us about countless different worlds. It's worth a few shocks.<br></font></p>
