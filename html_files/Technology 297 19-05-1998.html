            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ChiBrow - The children's browser<br>Developer: KCS & Associates<br>Cost: Free 30-day trial download, then approximately $50 to register with online discount. Normal price is about $80.<br>Parental fears about unsavoury sites on the World Wide Web are not unfounded.<br>It must be said that publicity about online pornography and bomb recipe sites is usually exagerrated. They are neither easy to view by accident, nor easy to access without credit card information. But they do exist and their content is not fit for young children . . . if indeed for anyone.<br>Children under 12 should be supervised by an adult when browsing the Web, but this is not always possible. Californian company KCS & Associates has produced what it regards as an answer to these worries.<br>It is called the ChiBrow - for children's browser - and promises adults the ability to define where children can venture on the Web. KCS says: ?We know that their browsing will be limited to only the sites that adults approve of.?<br>ChiBrow looks very limited when compared with the browser giants Internet Explorer and Netscape. It has a simple interface which allows manipulation only by someone - hopefully a parent, teacher or other responsible adult - with a password.<br>With that password, the adult is able to enter the URLs of sites deemed acceptable.<br>There is no facility for anyone to enter a Web address freehand, thus eliminating inquiring fingers typing the words ?sex sites?, for example.<br>The free trial copy of the program is even more limited, offering a drop-down menu of 20 pre-determined sites that are purely child or family-oriented.<br>These include three Disney sites, Nasa, Homework Help and Yahooligans. The set home page is ChiBrow itself, at which tips are offered for parents wanting to know more about regulating surfing.<br>KCS says Net filters such as NetNanny, which mostly work from lists of banned words, tend to deny access to content that may be both safe and educational.<br>For example, if you entered the word ?genitalia? in a filter list, your browser might be denied access to sites displaying pictures of Michelangelo's David, or important sex-education texts.<br>KCS also claims management of filters can be time consuming and frustrating. It says the ability of adults to enter acceptable sites in ChiBrow means the browser can be as flexible as the family's own attitudes to what is desirable and permissible for children to see and read.<br>ChiBrow maintains a database of allowable sites which the child accesses from the drop-down list.<br>Once a page is displayed, the child may browse using hyperlinks on the pages. Each link is verified before allowing the child to surf further. Allowable links are those within the same domain and/or located within a domain/site that the password-holder has included in the URL database.<br>When the child comes across a link that they would like to visit, but which is not allowed, the child has to ask the adult to include that URL in the database of allowed sites.<br>The full version of ChiBrow contains a list of pre-defined allowable sites that KCS says are safe. The company provides updates at its site that can be downloaded to the user's database.<br>The updates include descriptions of all new sites that can be added to the database. Users have the ability to add and delete from the upload list.<br></font></p>
