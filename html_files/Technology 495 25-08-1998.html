            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALTAVISTA has won critical acclaim as the fastest search engine on the World Wide Web.<br>Now it is promising similar results on personal systems.<br>The newly released AltaVista Discovery engine can be downloaded off the Net and installed to interrogate the data on a home user's own computer.<br>It looks and feels just like the well-known Web tool, and indeed it can be set up to search the Net while connected.<br>But its value is in the way it can seek and find a huge variety of document types from Excel spreadsheets to straight text files. Discovery is free at the moment. Its main cost appears to be its size, a 10Mb compressed file before installation.<br>But in these days of big hard disks and faster Net connections that is not over the top.<br>The big hard disks actually make the use of Discovery more appealing. As users fill their drives with more and more documents - because they have the space to do so - they need a fast way to find important data.<br>Windows operating systems have find functions geared to looking for filenames or document types.<br>Discovery allows searches for single words or phrases. For example, if you know you have documents about your telephone accounts on your system, but cannot remember where they are, you simply type ?telephone? in the Discovery window and stipulate you want to search your documents, and it will bring to screen anything with the word ?telephone? in it.<br>Discovery operates as a slim toolbar normally at the top of your screen.<br>When a query is entered it brings up your default Web browser to display results.<br>It can be configured in a variety of ways. You can have it displayed automatically on start-up. This results in your Net connection being triggered, too.<br>Or you can opt to place it on the desktop and use it when you choose. Discovery allows several different locations to act as the database to be searched. Called Search Spaces, these include the Web, a user's documents and any e-mail messages.<br>You have to set Discovery to index your PC before performing a search ... otherwise it would have no database to work on.<br>The indexing schedule is set up through the options menu and lets users choose daily, weekly or monthly settings.<br>Indexing can also be performed manually. The time taken will vary depending on the size of disks (you are not restricted to one drive), processor speed and memory, as well as the all important amount of information you want to search through.<br>Indexing is a background task that can impede any heavy programs you may want to run, so it is best to index in low-activity times.<br>AltaVista says Discovery's indexing allows it to perform a content-based search, increasing the performance of information retrieval significantly.<br>Discovery has all the usual tricks that help make AltaVista such a popular Web tool, including advanced searching and varying the length of summaries.<br>It has a facility to find related documents or pages, so that when you are looking at one document you can get a list of others with similar content.<br>Discovery requirements: Windows 95/98, or NT 4.0; 16Mb RAM; 24Mb disk space free; Navigator or MSIE 3.0 or higher. Estimated 28.8K download time: 50 to 65 minutes.<br>HELP DESK<br>AltaVista Discovery:<br>discovery.altavista.digital.<br>com<br></font></p>
