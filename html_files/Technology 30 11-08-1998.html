            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A SYDNEY businessman is using the World Wide Web to try to assure Asians that Pauline Hanson's One Nation party does not represent the views of most Australians.<br>Trevor Johnson, a 37-year-old management consultant and passionate Internet user, has published a web site called An Open Letter to the World Asian Communities.<br>Mr Johnson says he wants one million visitors to the site to read his message that Australians are not racist and that One Nation is an unrepresentative minority party.<br>Visitors to the site are taken point-by-point through Mr Johnson's views on Ms Hanson. He says:<br>?Asian media often exaggerate Ms Hanson's views and influence;<br>?One Nation has no similarity with the Ku Klux Klan, other than for racist attitudes;<br>?Ms Hanson has no power whatsoever. She is but one of more than 200 Federal parliamentarians;<br>?She is equally detested by both the Liberal-National Party Government, and the Labor Party Opposition.<br>Mr Johnson decided to go on his anti-Hanson web quest mainly because he believes the major parties are not doing enough to play down the Hanson factor overseas. His business has a predominantly international clientele, and he has many Asian friends.<br>?Whenever I "meet' anyone in an Asian chat room (on the Net), the moment I introduce myself as being an Australian, the first thing invariably they want to know is about Pauline Hanson,? Mr Johnson said in an e-mail interview.<br>?She is the only thing many people even know about Australia - certainly more famous than any other political figure in Australia and even more well known than the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Opera House.<br>?Her fame abroad is not good news. As much as I detest her blatant and her "latent" racist attitudes, I must say that some sections of the Asian media have exaggerated her out of all proportion, to the definite detriment of Australia.?<br>Mr Johnson gave examples where friends from Singapore and Indonesia had decided against either holidaying or settling in Australia because they believed racist attitudes fanned by Ms Hanson now prevailed.<br>?I've also chatted with probably a dozen or more students who were going to study at Australian universities but, due to the recent media attention, have decided to study in their own countries instead, or in a couple of cases, go to London,? Mr Johnson said.<br>?Business connections in Malaysia have advised me that, in the wake of the Queensland elections, they have been strongly advised by their government against doing business with Australia.?<br>His Open Letter site links to several anti-Hanson pages and welcomes feedback from visitors.<br>Help Desk<br>Open Letter to the World Asian Communities:<br>bestprac.com/asia/index.shtml<br></font></p>
