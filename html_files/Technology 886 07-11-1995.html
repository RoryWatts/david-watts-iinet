            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HAGGIS, bagpipes, kilts, Billy Connolly, Glaswegian accents ... depending on your point of view, we have a lot to thank the Scots for.<br>What we can be thankful for is that in 1768 three canny gentlemen from Edinburgh - Andrew Bell, Colin Macfarquhar and William Smellie - published the first Encyclopaedia Britannica.<br>As the oldest and biggest English-language general encyclopaedia, it is a byword for authority.<br>But at more than $1800 for a CD-ROM version, the Britannica is simply unable to compete electronically with the likes of Grolier, Colliers and the omnipresent Microsoft Encarta.<br>It is on the World Wide Web, however, and with an offer of a seven-day free trial, the Britannica is hard to resist if you are curious or have schoolchildren in the house, needing to know facts accurately and quickly.<br>Britannica Online, as it is called to distinguish itself from the groaning leather-bound common or garden variety Encyclopaedia Britannica, is up to version 1.3 on the Web.<br>One of the endearing features is a collection of 17 so-called classic articles by famous authors.<br>Here, Sigmund Freud analyses psychoanalysis, G.K. Chesterton waxes lyrical about Charles Dickens and Harry Houdini grapples with conjuring.<br>Another novel feature is for the surfer who is lost for a word or thought. Britannica Online offers a random article. Just click the hyper text and who knows what will appear.<br>The night I tried I was presented with the life and times of Elisha Graves Otis (1811-1861), a pioneer who invented the safety elevator. Without him we would never feel comfortable in anything over a two-storey building.<br>Britannica, in US hands since 1901, is as avid a sales pitcher as ever. Browsers have a choice of a demonstration database search, free seven-day trial, or joining up at $US125 a year.<br>URL for free trial registration: http://www.eb.com/splash.html.<br>David Watts ... watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
