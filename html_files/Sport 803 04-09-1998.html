            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">RUSSIA is in crisis, the world's stockmarkets are behaving like rollercoasters, and, dare it be said in this section, Australia is in the middle of an (expletive deleted) campaign.<br>You can find out about all these matters on the World Wide Web, at great length and in great depth.<br>But what really concerns me - and a lot of the population - are the AFL finals which start tonight at the MCG.<br>The AFL has a trendy official site with videos of games, news, analysis and so forth but far too much from the Adelaide Advertiser about the fortunes of Malcolm Blight and the Crows.<br>The Melbourne Age has its Footy98 section which is packed with news, statistics and opinion but one has to be wary of those eastern Staters at the best of times, let alone this time of the year when the Vics see the AFL premiership as their untouchable holy grail.<br>The Age does have that intelligent larrikin Dermott Brereton though, and he is proving to be as good a newspaper columnist as he was a champion for Hawthorn in its many grand finals of the 80s.<br>His words this week about the finals are worth a replay: ?Yes, the animal that writes this article is still seething that nature brings an ageing process with it.?I am a sad animal that can no longer chase the lure or hunt for prey. All I have is the memory and the vehicle to tell others what it means to play in finals.?You could lock me away in solitary confinement for years without a calendar, but I would still smell finals.?<br>Speaking of words . . . if you are lost for them while following the finals action on TV, there is an excellent Web site that just might help.<br>It is called the Lexicon of Football. Its downside is it was penned by a Carlton supporter. Seriously though, Carlton fans are among the more passionate and learned in the land - and their team failed to make the finals.<br>The lexicon can improve your barracking ability overnight. Here are a few choice examples: ?Centimetre Perfect - An extremely accurate pass. Known to send supporters into fits of absolute rage whenever it is said by Dennis Cometti.? (This of course is a Victorian view.) ?Collingwood - The Evil Empire? (a typical Carlton view). ?Girl, You - An abusive term used by some neanderthal men at the football to indicate that a particular player is soft. Generally frowned on as outdated and extremely sexist.?<br>?Idiot, You - A relatively recent addition to the barrackers' vocabulary but one that adds much mirth and jocularity. Said with a considerable amount of joy, usually about opposing players.?<br>?Idiot, You f...... - Reserved solely for when your player makes a mistake. Said with a considerable amount of anger.?<br>You get the picture don't you, you joke, you idiot, you big sheila's blouse, you soft pillow.<br>The words that the Web failed to enlighten me on while doing research for this article are from Mick Malthouse, the Eagles coach. ?The ox is slow but the earth is patient? simply left Web search engines scratching their electronic heads.<br>But why should they be any different?<br>Web addresses:<br>AFL: www.afl.com.au<br>FOOTY98: www.theage.com.au/footy98/index.html<br>DERMOTT BRERETON'S COLUMNS:<br>www.theage.com.au/footy98/news/brereton-past.html<br>Lexicon of Football: www.pipeline.com.au/users/kimo/<br>lexicon.htm<br></font></p>
