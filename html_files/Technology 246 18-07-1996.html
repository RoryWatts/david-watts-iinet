            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SINGAPORE'S brief flirtation with unfettered freedom of speech ended this week when the Government imposed some of the toughest Internet censorship in the world.<br>The island-state's 100,000 Net users cannot use cyberspace to:<br>? Bring the Government into hatred or contempt, or excite disaffection against it;<br>? Mislead and alarm the public;<br>? Jeopardise security or defence;<br>? Undermine confidence in the administration of justice.<br>The Government watchdog, the Singapore Broadcasting Authority, is responsible for determining what constitutes breaches of these rules.<br>Users or service providers found guilty will lose their licences to operate on the Net.<br>The laws are seen as repressive in that they will be able to stop criticism of the Government.<br>An Australian correspondent to an electronic newsgroup - or bulletin board - said the legislation was akin to the Australian Government not allowing Net users to say: ?John Howard is a dork?.<br>Comments on politics would be reduced to: ?Geez, isn't that nice Mr Howard a peachy-keen Prime Minister.?<br>The Straits Times newspaper said the censorship was aimed at safeguarding public morals, political stability and religious harmony.<br>The laws automatically license two groups of Net users - those who provide or sell Internet access and those who provide information with business, political and religious content.<br>Licensees have to provide to the Government lists of readers targeted by their Net service, and the names of editors, publishers and organisations behind them.<br>The Straits Times said this was a move to promote responsible use of the medium.<br>Critics see it as a way of presenting only good news about Singapore to the 40 million Net users worldwide.<br>The SBA is also responsible for stopping Net users providing objectionable material which it classifies as discussion, or pictures relating to sex, politics or religion.<br>SBA chief executive officer Goh Liang Kwang told the Straits Times that the laws aimed to encourage responsible use of the Internet, while allowing its healthy development.<br>Reaction to the censorship has been guarded. The predominantly Singapore-based users of the newsgroup alt.soc.singapore have mostly questioned the effect of the law on them. A few have openly attacked the laws, but other users have warned them to be careful.<br></font></p>
