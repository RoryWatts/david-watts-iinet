            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE fighting spirit of Steve Waugh has been everywhere since his never-say-die century against South Africa last week.<br>It goes without saying it infected his teammates so that they were able to out-stare South Africa, again, then pulverise Pakistan to win the World Cup.<br>Prime Minister John Howard has talked of little else, despite this probably being the biggest week in Federal politics of the year.<br>Hawthorn surely was imbued with the Waugh factor when it bounced back from 10 goals down to beat St Kilda on Saturday.<br>The Kangaroos must have called on Waugh to sneak in against Melbourne on Sunday; and Collingwood showed it had learnt a trick or two - unfortunately one trick short - about fighting the odds against Adelaide.<br>Even the Irish rugby union team showed signs of the Waugh spirit at Subiaco Oval on Saturday night.<br>Then our Wallabies reminded them in no uncertain terms that Waugh is Australian, to be sure.<br>Perth television viewers reacted to Waugh's narrow-eyed inspiration in big numbers.<br>Channel 9 says the Thursday semi-final audience totalled 488,000.<br>Obviously, they liked what they saw because program manager Ric Bryndzej said yesterday that 669,000 people tuned in to the Sunday night final.<br>In Australia's five biggest cities, an average of 2.875 million viewers watched Mark Waugh's catch, Shane Warne's wizardry, Tom Moody's economy and Glenn McGrath's moments of ecstasy and agony.<br>They did not see much of a game despite all this, although Adam Gilchrist's 54 would have been worth watching even if Australia had been beaten.<br>It was last Thursday's semi-final that produced the game of the series - if not the decade.<br>The tie with South Africa exhausted all the adjectives in the sporting dictionary.<br>In future, when we are tempted to call a cricket match dramatic, exciting or great, we will have to refer to this match. It is now the benchmark.<br>The World Cup triumph obviously says a lot about Waugh and the Australian team.<br>Remember how flat and sloppy they were when the series began last month, hot on the heels of months of slogging it out against Pakistan, then England and finally the West Indies?<br>The evolution from tired team to world champion has been mirrored by reaction to the TV coverage.<br>?Aside from the telecasts of the preliminary matches in which Australia struggled, the viewers' acceptance of the coverage grew match by match, that is, as the Aussies started to win so did Channel 9,? Bryndzej said.<br>?It's yet another reinforcement of what we all know. As Australians we love winning and we'll watch any of our national sides in any sport when they are on top.?<br>NINE took risks by shuffling popular programs such as Sixty Minutes and the Footy Show so that the cricket could take over prime time, and by allowing armchair fan Ray Martin to intrude on matches. But Bryndzej said public reaction had been overwhelmingly positive.<br>Those who thought Sunday ended a run of late nights should note Nine is now showing Wimbledon.<br>The only question - has Pat Rafter caught the Steve Waugh bug?<br></font></p>
