            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WILLY from Edgewater would not stop sending me e-mails. ?Margaret Rutherford is only a 2?, ?Will Fyfe is easy, would you believe?? and most telling ?Mate, I just can't stop doing this?.<br>The avid Perth Internet user was another victim, one of a growing number throughout the world. His addiction was serious. His e-mails to me were usually time-stamped 3.05am or something equally ridiculous.<br>Willy (not his real name ... to protect the innocent) had fallen for Kevin Bacon, co-star of more than 20 films from Footloose to Apollo 13.<br>The photogenic 38-year-old is all the rage at college campuses and on the Internet, for his perennial number two, three or four billing status. Bacon is almost omnipresent. And if he isn't, then it doesn't take too long to find him.<br>This quality of seemingly being everywhere has made Bacon the main subject in a parlour game variously called the Kevin Bacon Game, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and Making Bacon.<br>The object is to name any film star and then have that star linked to a film in which Bacon has appeared. Chances are that, even if you name an obscure actor, such as our own ?Moonface? Bert Newton, there will be a reasonably quick link back to a Bacon film.<br>It goes like this: think of a star, say Meg Ryan. Ryan appeared in Sleepless in Seattle. So did Tom Hanks. Hanks was an astronaut in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon.<br>Or Tim Curry. Curry was with Susan Sarandon in The Rocky Horror Show; Sarandon was with Kevin Costner in Bull Durham and Costner and Bacon were in JFK together.<br>These are easy. Ryan has what is known as a Bacon Factor of 2 and Curry has a 3. The factor is the number of films it took to find the one in which Bacon starred.<br>Real aficionados of the game say it is best when you aim for a Bacon Factor of 6, hence the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon tag. The six degrees is borrowed from the talky film Six Degrees of Separation starring Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing in which it was theorised that it took only six people to find one exactly like you. Which six was the dramatic interest.<br>Sutherland, by the way, has a Bacon Factor of 1. He co-starred with Bacon in JFK.<br>CHANNING was in Grease with John Travolta, Christian Slater's co-star in Broken Arrow, and Slater was with Bacon in Murder in the First.<br>It is maddening. The game can be played on the Internet using a sophisticated search engine linked to the voluminous Internet Movie DataBase which has details of more than 50,000 films.<br>Simply enter your actor's name in a box and within a minute the computer program, known as the Kevin Bacon Oracle, will show how your star is linked to Bacon.<br>Purists say they hate this computerised intervention, preferring to play the game in their heads or with reference books on film trivia.<br>But it does allow a lot of games to be played quickly.<br>The Oracle even lists the stars that players have tried to link to Bacon most frequently. Of 360,000 entries so far, Elvis Presley is the most requested. He is easily linked, by the way. He was with Ann-Margret in Viva Las Vegas, who was with Jack Nicholson in Carnal Knowledge, who was with you-know-who in A Few Good Men. A Bacon Factor of only 3 for ?The King?.<br>Brett Tjaden, who put the Oracle to work on the Net, told the Los Angeles Times last month he now had 170,000 actors linked to Bacon. Among them are many who are so obscure as to be unknown to anyone but their closest family.<br>Take Dmitri Vasilyev, who appeared in one film, the 1928 silent Plenniki Morya. Tjaden says Vasilyev has a Bacon Factor of 6.<br>The Bacon game was begun by three US college students, Craig Fass, Brian Turtle and Mike Ginelli while they were ?frustrated movie trivia buffs at Pennsylvania's Albright College in 1994?, according to the Chicago Tribune.<br>On a snowy day, drinking too much beer and watching TV, the three started to speculate that the productive Bacon had starred with everyone in Hollywood.<br>From this far-fetched idea came the game.<br>The three got their idea on cable TV in the US. Bacon even appeared on the show - somewhat mystified by this strange fame which after a few airings turned into an almost national craze, the Tribune says.<br>Now, the question you've all been waiting to see answered: how is Bert Newton linked to Bacon?<br>Newton was in Fatty Finn (1980) with Greg Kelly, who was in Manhunter (1986) with Peter Maloney, who was in JFK (1991) with Bacon.<br>So says the Internet Oracle (which also allows you to play the game with Arnie Schwarzenegger instead of Bacon).<br>For the Net-aware, here are some addresses to browse:<br>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon:<br>http://www.spub.ksu.edu/issues/v100/FA/n069/fea-making-bacon-fuq   Kevin Bacon Game:<br>http://www.metronet.com/~jmacfee/kbacon.htm<br>Kevin Bacon Oracle:<br>http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/bacon.html<br></font></p>
