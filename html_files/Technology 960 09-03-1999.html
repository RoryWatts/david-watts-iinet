            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS not unknown to lose track of time while using the Internet.<br>The other day, or maybe it was night, I was:<br>?Listening to 6PR on RealAudio.<br>?Contemplating what pizza to order online.<br>?Firing up a RealVideo trailer of the new Austin Powers movie.<br>?Reading the scoreboard and commentary of the first West Indies-Australia Test from Trinidad while simultaneously checking the state of play in three Sheffield Shield matches.<br>?Checking out the progress of an online chat about the seriousness of Ben Cousins' knee injury.<br>The Net made all these cool pursuits possible for an old sports junkie like me, but I had a feeling real life on the outside might be passing me by.<br>To get in touch with nearby geography I decided to check out the state of the new artificial reef off Cottesloe.<br>I went to the Coastal Data Centre's Coastcam on the Web. I clicked on a map and hey presto ... it was pitch black.<br>The Coastcam was working fine, presenting constantly updated pictures of the reef back to my Web browser.<br>But it was 11 o'clock at night and the sun had long sizzled into the ocean past Rottnest.<br>Where had the day gone? And did it matter when I could easily hop on a virtual bike and ?cycle? around Rotto anyway?<br>Or was time important with the next edition of the New York Times due off the cyber presses, particularly now that it had dropped its subscription fees and rejoined the land of free information?<br>Besides, I could just as easily be useful now and pay some bills through my online bank.<br>Time does not really matter on the Net. And despite the rapid progress of its technology - witness RealAudio and Video or Macromedia Flash tours of Rottnest - its user base is almost stuck in one place, truly timeless.<br>You will find after a couple of years that the majority of other people out there have hopped on only recently.<br>The take-up rate is phenomenal. In the UK alone, more than 10,000 new users a day are signing up mainly through free ISPs which have decided to drop all fees and take a percentage of the income generated by British Telecom's timed local calls.<br>This flurry of new Netizens causes the wheel to be re-invented constantly. Just as you work up the courage to repartition your hard drive to install Linux, you will be asked why Yahoo gives so many different answers to a simple question.<br>Perhaps you will be stuck in a discussion group forever reminding new members not to post big attachments. Or certainly not to open them in case of nasty viruses.<br>Such timelessness deserves some sort of solution. The people at Swatch watches in Switzerland believe they have the answer with Internet Time which they describe as revolutionary and based on a totally new unit of time, the beat of a Swatch, or 1 minute 26.4 seconds.<br>I haven't had time to find out more. Someone wants to know why his online bank won't send money through his fax machine.<br>HELP DESK<br>6PR: www.6pr.com.au/live.ram<br>CricInfo (for the Tests): www-aus.cricket.org<br>PizzaNow: www.pizzanow.com.au<br>Austin Powers trailer: www.austinpowers.com<br>AFL (for football): www.afl.com.au<br>Coastal Data Centre:<br>www.coastaldata.transport.wa.gov.au<br>Rottnest (for virtual tour): www.rottnest.wa.gov.au<br>New York Times: www.nytimes.com<br>Swatch Internet Time: www.swatch.com/internettime/<br>beatnik-fs-time.html<br></font></p>
