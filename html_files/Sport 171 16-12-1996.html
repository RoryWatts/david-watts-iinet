            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETBALL is the most popular women's sport in Australia. It is derived from basketball which was invented in the US in 1891.<br>Basketball spread quickly to other countries and by 1897 English women were playing it, but outside on grass rather than inside.<br>Within a year significant changes had been made to the game which resulted in the first appearance of what we now know as netball.<br>English school teachers brought the game to Australia. There are records of inter-school games as early as 1913. In 1927 the All Australian Women's Basket Ball Association (AAWBB) was formed and promoted seven-a-side netball.<br>There were no standard rules at this time, and there was a nine-a-side and a five-a-side version of the game.<br>According to the Australian Institute of Sport, standardisation of rules was discussed on an Australian tour of England in 1957.<br>These discussions led to the formation in 1960 of the International Federation of Basketball and Netball Federations (IFNA).<br>International tournaments were suggested at this meeting to be held every four years. The first of these World Championships was in 1963.<br>In 1970 the title All Australia Netball Association was adopted and the game was officially named netball.<br>Recent rule changes have meant that the modern international game is fast andexciting, providing excellent television.<br>Did you know?<br>NETBALL has been one of Australia's most consistently successful international sports.<br>The Australian team has won seven of nine world championship title, the most recent being in July 1995 in Birmingham, England.<br>The Australian team has dominated other international events too, finishing no worse than second at any major tournament.<br>It's world titles were in 1963, 1971, 1975, 1979, 1983, 1991 and 1995.<br>The number of countries affiliated with the International Federation of Netball Associations is increasing. Most of the new affiliates are African countries.<br>Netball is the most popular sport for Australian women, with more than 350,000 registered players.<br>Before 1970 netball was known in Australia as women's basketball.<br>Netball will be an official sport at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.<br>Profile of Australian captain - Vicki Wilson:<br>Position: goal shooter, goal attack.<br>Height: 184cm<br>Birthdate: 11 February, 1965.<br>Occupation: Teacher/sports administrator.<br>Local Club: Broadwater Canons, Queensland.<br>Test caps: 66.<br>Details: Had Vicki not grown to be taller than most of the boys in her street she may well have been a ballet dancer rather than a netball player. This was her early dream. Down the track she is extremely glad of her choice, having been a member for the Australian netball team for over a decade.<br>Last year she played her third World Championships and is the only member of the current team to have done so. Her dedication was rewarded earlier this year when she was awarded the captaincy for the first time.<br>AUSTRALIAN TEAM<br>Big game results this year:<br>June 1: Australia d South Africa at Challenge Stadium, Perth 77-44<br>June 22: Milo Cup, Australia d NZ at Sydney Sports Centre 49-40<br>June 26: Milo Cup, Australia d NZ at Adelaide Powerhouse 58-39<br>June 29: Milo Cup, Australia d NZ at Melbourne Glasshouse 56-35<br>November 16: Fisher and Paykel Cup, Australia d NZ at Sydney Entertainment Centre - 52-41.<br>Best of the best<br>The Australian squad chosen after this year's national championships in Perth:<br>SA: Jenny Borlase<br>Jane Brandford<br>Audine Cobb<br>Jacqui Delaney<br>Kathryn Harby<br>Peta Squire<br>Sarah Sutter<br>NSW: Catherine Cox<br>Nicole Cusack<br>Carissa Dalwood<br>Liz Ellis<br>Vic: Susie Howie<br>Janine Lynch<br>Simone McKinnis<br>Shelley O'Donnell<br>Eloise Southby<br>Liz Taverner<br>Qld: Vicki Wilson (captain)<br>Global game<br>AT INTERNATIONAL level, the game is controlled by the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA) which was formed in 1960.<br>It is estimated that more than two million players are active in thegame all over the world, including Barbados, Bahamas and Jamaica (West Indies), Sri Lanka, India, Fiji and Vanuatu (in the Pacific), Hong Kong and Singapore (in South-East Asia) and Kenya and Tanzania (in Africa).<br>The top netball nations are Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago,Jamaica and England.<br>Game in brief<br>NETBALL is a seven-a-side team game traditionally played by women and girls, although over the last 10 years it has become popular with men and boys as well.<br>A player's position on the court determines which of the two functions they concentrate on most - there are attack and defence positions.<br>There are seven positions, each with restricted areas in which they areallowed. Letters showing the position are worn on players' uniforms.<br>Centre (C) - has the most freedom, allowed in all areas except the goal circlesand plays major roles in attack and defence.<br>Wing attack (WA) and wing defence (WD) - situated at opposite ends of the court, with each allowed in the centre court and their respective goalthirds only.<br>Goal attack (GA) and goal defence (GD) - similar to the wing positions, except both are allowed in their respective goal circles as well as the centre and goal thirds, with (GA) shooting goals and (GD) trying to stop the opposition scoring.<br>The goal shooter (GS) who also shoots for goal and the goal keeper (GK) who tries to prevent goals are allowed only in their respective goal circles and goal thirds.<br>Big difference<br>THE crucial difference between netball and basketball is netball players must remain almost stationary while they have the ball, using passes to convey the ball down to their two shooters, who are the only ones allowed to score.<br>A player has a limited amount of movement only and must stop or pass the ball once they have gained possession. A player cannot hold the ball for more than 3seconds.<br>Body contact is not allowed, neither is obstruction or holding a player, throwing the ball to yourself, bouncing the ball to yourself, very short passes or stepping.<br>A game is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each, with 3 minute intervals between the quarters. Half-time is a maximum of 10 minutes. Injury time is added to each quarter.<br>Two umpires control the game watching half the court each from the sideline.<br>Players may wear shirts, blouses or leotards with skirts or shorts. Shoes must not be spiked, and must suit the court surface.<br>Success trail<br>National results of recent years:<br>1993<br>Mobil League: Adelaide Garville 1, Sydney Electricity 2, Adelaide Contax 3; National championship: NSW 1, SA 2, Vic 3.<br>1994<br>Mobil League: Adelaide Contax 1, Adelaide Garville 2, Melbourne Keas 3; National championship: NSW 1, SA 2, Qld 3.<br>1995<br>Mobil League: Sydney Electricity 1, Melbourne Waverley Pumas 2, Adelaide Garville 3.
