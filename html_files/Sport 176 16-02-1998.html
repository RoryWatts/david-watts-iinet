            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I MUST apologise. In the past few weeks I have made several references to the ?lunatics on the luge? in various articles.<br>After a week of watching the Winter Olympics from Nagano on Channel 7, I have changed my initially uninformed opinion.<br>They are not merely lunatics. They are dumb, stupid, definitely certifiable, dead from the neck up ... jokes.<br>But what fun. For the uninitiated the luge is a small sled. A luger is a person of the above requirements who lies flat on the sled and slides at speeds up to 130kmh down an iceslide (imagine a waterslide but much, much colder).<br>You can even have a double luge in which one nutter lies on top of the other, sort of like a lopsided sandwich.<br>Lugers negotiate the descent without perceptible moves. On my reading of the Encyclopedia Britannica's guide to the cool games, they use minute twitches of the shoulders and legs - and no doubt the eyes - to steer them on their way to what looks like certain death.<br>The winner is not only the fastest over four slides down the 1000m-to-1300m course - time differences are measured in thousandths of a second - but more importantly, the one who has lived to tell the tale.<br>In Nagano, the solo gold went to Germany's Georg Hackl for the third Games running. Last Monday a small crowd gathered in front of my TV to watch the 31-year-old army sergeant make his first run.<br>There was stunned silence for the roughly 49.999 seconds that Hackl dived around the Spiral course.<br>Then this: ?Awesome? (from a 13-year-old girl), ?Unbelievable? (a 12-year-old), ?Oh wicked? (nine-year-old boy), ?Coooool? (another boy), ?Dumb? (40-plus man) and .... (unprintable from another 40-plus man).<br>The luge provokes mixed emotions then. One is undoubtedly: why bother?<br>Channel 7 has thrown the kitchen sink and lots of cuddly red and white sweaters at covering these games for little result, judging by the ratings.<br>That is hardly surprising given the sheer foreignness of the events, no matter how exhilarating or graceful they are.<br>Ice dancing can be glorious entertainment, but do we want to watch Sandy Roberts interviewing our brave and bubbly 13th-placed Australian duo for more than 10 minutes at peak time?<br>Or do we need to listen to Neil Brooks trying to grapple with the intricacies of moguls when all the time he sounds exactly like what he is: a swimmer out of water?<br>And Bruce McAvaney just loves to enmesh himself in sport - here he has been shouting at the speed skating - but aren't we seeing just a teensy bit much of him, particularly with six months of footy just rarin' to go?<br>Seven has an important commitment to covering Olympic competition, but has taken it a bit far with Nagano.<br>And no one has yet answered the most important question from the first week: why did both the silver and bronze medallists in the men's snowboarding giant slalom test negative for marijuana?<br>Surely they are all on something.<br></font></p>
