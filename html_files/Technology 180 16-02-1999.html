            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA COMPUTER users have been swept up in an annoying global trend ... their computers have caught the happy99 bug.<br>It sounds like fun, but is far from it. The happy99 or ska bug is a computer worm - less dangerous than a virus but often as annoying - that can send hundreds of copies of itself to e-mail addresses and newsgroups without the sender being aware of it.<br>Happy99 is sent as an attachment to e-mail where it carries the tag happy99.exe.<br>People who execute the attachment see a screen filled with fireworks. There is nothing to it ... except in the background the happy99 bug is toying with several files.<br>It creates files called ska.exe and ska.dll in the windows\system directory, and, if it can at the time, alters the wsock32.dll file - critical for Internet use.<br>Even if it cannot affect wsock32.dll at the time the happy99.exe attachment is opened, it waits for a reboot, then replaces wsock32.dll with a nuisance version and renames wsock32.dll as wsock32.ska.<br>The result of all this is that each time the user sends e-mail, happy99.exe attaches itself.<br>It cannot be seen in the user's out list, nor if users send e-mail to themselves.<br>But it is delivered to whoever the e-mail is sent. If they execute the attachment, the worm spreads some more.<br>First reports of happy99 filtered through to the Net in late January. Users in the US and Europe were reporting it and alerts were broadcast in a wide variety of newsgroups as well as on Web sites.<br>A search for happy99 at dejaNews reveals it has sparked complaints from more than 1000 users in Italy, Germany, France, Britain, the US and now Australia.<br>Several sites (see Help Desk) have full explanations of the bug, plus the fairly simple way to get rid of it.<br>Anyone who has executed the happy99.exe attachment on a Windows 95, 98 or NT system should check for the presence of these files: ska.exe, ska.dll, liste.ska and wsock32.ska. They will be in the windows\system directory (or the system sub-directory of whatever folder you have created for Windows).<br>The best cleansing method is to go to DOS, change into the system directory (CD windows\system), then DEL (the delete command) ska.exe, ska.dll and wsock32.dll. Then REN (for rename) wsock32.ska as wsock32.dll.<br>If you want to be more careful, reinstall wsock32.dll from original set-up.<br>When you return to Windows, open liste.ska in Notepad. This file shows a list of all e-mail addresses to which you have passed on happy99. Contact them and pass on the cleansing instructions.<br>And ensure you delete happy99.exe from your system.<br>The easiest remedy is not to open e-mail attachments with .exe suffixes.<br>Happy99 does not appear to cause damage or in any way affect the normal running of an infected computer, but it does clog Net connections with junk and consume time as people try to deal with it.<br>It does not appear to affect Apple Macs, Windows 3.x or DOS machines.<br>HELP DESK<br>These sites have more information and remedies on happy99:<br>www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/<br>3652/SKA.HTM<br>www.pspl.com/trojan_info/win32/<br>happy99.htm<br>www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/<br>data/happy99.worm.html<br></font></p>
