Former players were not allowed to vote for themselves. Eleven active players are among the 50:<br>The list is:<br>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar<br>Nate Archibald<br>Paul Arizin<br>Charles Barkley<br>Rick Barry<br>Elgin Baylor<br>Dave Bing<br>Larry Bird<br>Wilt Chamberlain<br>Bob Cousy<br>Dave Cowens<br>Billy Cunningham<br>Dave DeBusschere<br>Clyde Drexler<br>Julius Erving<br>Patrick Ewing<br>Walt Frazier<br>George Gervin<br>Hal Greer<br>John Havlicek<br>Elvin Hayes<br>Magic Johnson<br>Michael Jordan<br>Sam Jones<br>Jerry Lucas<br>Karl Malone<br>Moses Malone<br>Pete Maravich<br>Kevin McHale<br>George Mikan<br>Earl Monroe<br>Hakeem Olajuwon<br>Shaquille O'Neal<br>Robert Parish<br>Bob Pettit<br>Scottie Pippen<br>Willis Reed<br>Oscar Robertson<br>David Robinson<br>Bill Russell<br>Dolph Schayes<br>Bill Sharman<br>John Stockton<br>Isiah Thomas<br>Nate Thurmond<br>Wes Unseld<br>Bill Walton<br>Jerry West<br>Lenny Wilkens<br>James Worthy<br>Great moments<br>Wilt the Stilt<br>Wilt Chamberlain was so good he forced the authorities to change the rules. When Wilt played in college the NCAA introduced four rules - no inbounds passes over the backboard, no offensive goal-tending, no long jump free throws (he could jump and jam) and defending team gets both positions nearest goal during free throws - and when he went to the NBA, it adopted a rule against goal tending and widened the lane from 12 to 16 feet.<br>He was responsible for the NBA's only 100-point game by an individual, a 4000-point season, was the only centre to lead the league in assists, won the MVP award four times, won 11 rebounding titles and had career averages of 30 points, 23 rebounds and 46 minutes per game.Setting screens<br>First, it was basketball. Then commercials. Then rapping. Now it's movies.<br>Shaquille O'Neal appeared in Blue Chips, a fictional account of a college program, that hit the screen in 1994. InKazaam, released this year, he plays a hip-hop 90s genie who teams up with a street-smart 12 year old. And the script writers are already at work on a movie with the working title of Shaq Fu, due to be filmed next year.<br>Not to be outdone, Michael Jordan has teamed up with Bugs Bunny and other Looney Tunes characters forSpace Jam, release imminent.<br>Best of the best<br>Street and Smiths basketball magazine fed a computer with stats and rankings and asked it to produce the All-NBA, All-Time, All-Star team. Here it is.<br>Starters: Wilt Chamberlain (centre), Larry Bird (forward), Julius Erving (forward), Magic Johnson (guard), Michael Jordan (guard). Bench: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Elvin Hayes, Elgin Baylor, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West.<br>Michael Jordan<br>THE highest profile in world sport belongs to 33-year-old Michael Jordan, guard for the<br>Chicago Bulls.<br>Jordan's all-round brilliance and his aerial genius - giving him the nickname Air Jordan - are major reasons that the NBA has become such a big sport on the world stage.<br>Jordan is 200cm tall and weighs 98kg. He wears number 23.<br>Career highlights:<br>Drafted to Chicago in 1984. Member of the Bulls four NBA championship teams (1991,<br>1992, 1993, 1996).

The following year it was introduced in Tientsin, China and India, and by 1900 was being played in YMCAs and churches in Japan and Persia.<br>It made its Olympic debut at the 1936 Berlin games. The US won gold, Canada won silver, and Mexico the bronze.<br>After World War II basketball experienced rapid worldwide growth. In 1948 Australia became the 52nd affiliated member of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), an organisation that boasts 201 members today.<br>The NBA started in 1946 because businessmen wanted to attract people to their indoor venues on nights when ice hockey was not being played.<br>Eleven teams made up the first series. The championship has gone from strength to strength since. Its players attract global followings and command huge salaries.<br>Games are showbusiness events in themselves with ever-more-ornate light shows, dancing girls and music to entertain up to 20,000 spectators at a time.<br>This season runs until late April with games across North America most nights of the week, attracting prime-time TV coverage.<br>Sources of statistics and information:<br>http://www.nba.com/ (Official NBA site)<br>http://rainbow.rmii.com/ ~doug/NBA.html (Doug's NBA Stat Page)<br>http://www.ausport.gov.au/basketb/hist02.html (Basketball Australia)<br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/nba.htm (Washington Post - The NBA)<br></font></p>
