            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DEVELOPERS of the Fremantle Dockers Web site are taking a punt on the future of the medium that is every bit as adventurous as the club's style of play under original coach Gerard Neesham.<br>Subiaco firm Guerilla has set up a subscription-only area at the Dockers site, known as the Virtual Supporters Club.<br>People who want more than player profiles, results, some pictures and club news have to pay $60 a year.<br>This allows them to enter a whole new area of the site that offers online chat with players, club gossip, special e-mail addresses, a pack of club merchandise, exclusive downloads such as club screensavers, competitions and discounts.<br>Virtual supporters are also able to join the Internet service provider Astro at special cut rates.<br>Fremantle now joins Essendon as the only AFL club Web sites that ask for subscriptions for extra services.<br>But official club sites - and not every club has one - range from the purely promotional with few offerings, except contact and membership details, to those like West Coast's which have the ability to play live radio broadcasts.<br>Football club sites, like the Web itself, are developing at different rates.<br>Ruwan Weerasooriya, of Guerilla, has been with the Dockers' site since its birth three years ago.<br>He pointed out last week that the site still offered the same free features it always had.<br>But the Dockers had to choose whether to leave the site in its previous state - stagnation, according to Mr Weerasooriya - or to use it to give supporters the extras they expected as use of the Web grew.<br>More interactive and involved projects required additional resources. Guerilla felt they represented value that the public was willing to pay for.<br>The bottom line was that sites like the Dockers were niche products with an appeal to a set market.<br>But the Web represented as exciting a development for such clubs as it did for big business.<br>Mr Weerasooriya said that by choosing to keep developing the site the Dockers had the chance to keep abreast of a medium that made transactions easier and that could add services.<br>He spoke of the possibility of supporters one day being able to send virtual postcards to fans of teams that the Dockers had beaten.<br>?That would certainly be something different to what you can do on the phone now, and keep people talking and involved with the club,? he said.<br>ADDING paid-for features simply acknowledged that the early days of simple, almost brochure-like sites developed on shoestring budgets were over.<br>?Entertainment driven sites have to weigh up the benefits of online brand development as part of their advertising mix against the cost of becoming involved with the Web,? Mr Weerasooriya said.<br>?I think you will certainly see more starting to experiment with the model in the near future.<br>?We accept that the subscription model we are using may not be the solution to how the site runs in the future.<br>?If advertising is seen as the single driver for online participation, many organisations find that the budget they are comfortable to allocate is prohibitive in allowing them to provide all the services they would love to get involved in, such as real audio, virtual reality and interactive games.<br>?These are the same services that the online public is demanding.<br>?I don't believe that in the short term these sites will be looking to the Web site to make a profit in its own right.<br>?They are simply looking for a method to cover the development costs so they can provide the public with a better experience.<br>?Who knows, as more people take up Internet access and the audiences becomes larger, or once the sites have the funding from subscriptions to provide all the bells and whistles on the Web site, it may draw significant numbers so that the advertising revenue model works and subscriptions may be scrapped.<br>?Personally I would love to see this happen,? Mr Weerasooriya said.<br>He claimed it was too early to tell what difference the subscription services were making.<br>Only a trickle had joined the Virtual Supporters Club, but this was bound to grow once the AFL season got under way, and more people visited AFL sites.<br>Even in 12 months, Mr Weerasooriya will be happy if virtual supporters number only a few hundred.<br>Although West Coast's site remains free, there are signs that the cost of providing extra Web services is being addressed.<br>Polls at the special online members' area are asking if supporters would pay fees to see extra features at the site like exclusive pictures.<br>Cross-promotional deals are also helping lift the number of visitors to the site.<br>A club source said last week that traffic to the site had increased 50 per cent since last year, and that thousands of extra hits were registered after a promotion on a local radio station.<br>HELP DESK<br>Fremantle Dockers: www.dockers.com.au<br>Guerilla: www.guerilla.com.au<br>Astro: www.astro.com.au<br>West Coast Eagles: www.<br>westcoasteagles.com.au<br></font></p>
