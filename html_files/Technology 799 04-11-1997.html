            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Your PC can say hello or goodbye in hundreds of different ways. One of the customisable joys of Windows 95 is providing the sound files for start-up and shut-down.<br>My favourite start-up sound is of Homer Simpson at the computer. It is taken from an episode of the popular cartoon and has dear, dumb Homer learning to operate a computer from home that controls radiation levels at the Springfield nuclear power plant ? yes, disaster did strike.<br>And no wonder. Homer looks at the manual and mutters: ?To start, press any key. Where's the Any key??<br>The loveable klutz's confusion with following a computer manual - and this is the man who says ?Operator, give me the number for 911? - is more common than you think.<br>I once worked at the Guardian in London dispensing computer advice to a staff of journalists who were mostly Oxford or Cambridge graduates. It turned out they were not computing graduates, unfortunately.<br>As a revered international paper, the Guardian sent reporters to every corner of the globe to cover even middling coups and State visits. My job was to equip the reporters with a laptop and the right phone connections and instruct them how to file their words from the middle of the Gobi Desert (it didn't work) or Peru (always did) plus any other spot on the planet you'd care to mention.<br>One reporter was sent to Germany for the launch of a new Mercedes-Benz model. He crashed it but that is not the story. Before he left, he got a one-on-one training session and a carefully worded instruction manual on how to use a laptop to get his words back in no time at all.<br>The phone call from Baden Baden, Berlin or Bonn (I forget which) went like this:<br>Reporter - This laptop you gave me seems to be a dud, old chap.<br>Me - It was working fine when you and I tested it, what's happening?<br>Reporter - Well, I type F3 to upload, then type the name of my story, then type Enter, just as the manual says, and nothing happens, dear fellow.<br>Me - indecipherable and unprintable.<br>What the manual actually said was ?To upload, press F3, type the name of your story and (meaning hit the ENTER key).?<br>Anyway, to cut an already very long story short, I am actually avoiding the issue. I cannot get Channels to work in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. And I couldn't get Netcaster to work in Netscape Communicator either.<br>I am a failure, a techno-dunce, yet I have read all the documentation and even the excellent tips for push technology at cnet's Web site.<br>It should be simple but, like Homer and the roving reporter, I must be misunderstanding something.<br>The aim is to have MSIE 4.0 dial the Net automatically at 8am and download the Australian National News Channel. Then, after I have showered, shaved and read The West Australian, I can read the channel even though I am not on the Net.<br>I have followed the subscription wizard through, telling the system to send me e-mail when the news is updated, saying to log on to the Net even if I am not on the PC and to do it daily at 8am.<br>Something is happening. I have looked at my browser cache - MSIE calls it the Temporary Internet folder - and there are strange sub-folders with names such as Dj256bxw which contain files that look like they could be the news I want if they were joined together.<br>But clicking on the actual channel in offline mode causes the browser to rebuke me with the words ?not in cache?.<br>I have rummaged around re-configuring everything so that Netscape is no longer my default browser and MSIE 4.0 can display what only it can digest.<br>But nothing; not a byte.<br>My suspicion is that having the PC download an online newspaper for my perusal at my leisure may actually be a good thing, though heaven knows what it could do to the newspapers made out of real paper.<br>But until I do, I have to repeat earlier criticisms of push technology in general, and both Channels and Netcaster in particular.<br>They are not intuitive and are difficult to comprehend. They may take away the sense of freedom of choice and mild adventure that comes with roaming the Web.<br>And they are heavily commercial and have the potential to have us all reaching for our credit cards in the future if we want to keep reading what we now take for granted to be free.<br></font></p>
