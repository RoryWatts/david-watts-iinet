            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>Blues Brothers 2000 (PG)<br>Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman<br>Directed by John Landis<br>H H½<br>Review: David Watts<br>IMAGINE a snack of cold toast with cold baked beans. Then imagine washing down that repulsive dish with one or possibly two bottles of the finest Grange Hermitage.<br>Blues Brothers 2000 is just like that. The cold food is the film and the Grange is the music that dominates it.<br>This may come as a disappointment to the vast army of people who revere the 1980 original Blues Brothers but its sequel is a vapid and timid creation saved by music.<br>The original crackled with creativity, energy and laughs. The sequel lacks nearly everything but - and it is a big but - the music is to die for. In fact you have to sit through nearly two hours to be rewarded by one of the greatest musical moments to grace the big screen. It is a number performed by a group called the Louisiana Gator Boys.<br>Never heard of them? Well they are led by B.B. King. Playing second fiddle, so to speak, is Eric Clapton. On sax is Bruce Springsteen's man Clarence Clemons. And among the massive back-up are Stevie Winwood, Dr John, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Billy Preston and Isaac Hayes.<br>And they are just the entree for James Brown, who wails as the credits roll.<br>Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett are among the stars who revitalise interest in earlier sequences. Their appearances certainly help to ward off boredom or exasperation.<br>It is anyone's guess why director John Landis and actor Dan Aykroyd, who plays Elwood Blues, chose to write a sequel to such a one-off cult film 18 years after its birth, and well after the death of John Belushi, who was the funnier, fatter Blues brother Jake.<br>At least they had the good sense not to recreate Jake, though the casting of John Goodman as Mighty Mack McTeer, the barman who just happens to possess a bluesy voice, certainly makes it look as if they thought about it.<br>And you know there is a paucity of ideas when a child - in this case J. Evan Bonifant as an orphan called Buster - is given centre stage and sage lines.<br>Nothing - with the notable exception of the fine music - hangs together well. The story-line has Elwood being released from prison to learn of Jake's death. He returns to the orphanage and finds a tenuous family link to a possible stepbrother who happens to be Chicago police commander Cabel Chamberlain (Jo Morton).<br>Chamberlain, or Cab, won't help Elwood's quest to reform the Blues Brothers band; in fact he leads a police hunt for the man who now has ?kidnapped? Buster, been the victim of Russian gangsters and broken dozens of traffic rules.<br>All this paves the way for a big chase through several States as the re-formed band - with the addition of Mack as lead singer and Buster on harmonica - heads to a gig at a Louisiana battle of the bands hosted by a Cajun witch.<br>But it's nearly all been done before; 18 years ago it was fresh and exciting.<br>The massive build-up of police cars chasing the band is an attempt to recreate the memorable multiple pile-up in Blues Brothers.<br>In fact many more cars are crashed in this sequel but the pile-up is so contrived and predictable the viewer is left wishing it would end, rather than rolling around laughing.<br>Where Jake and Elwood were ?on a mission from God?, the solo Elwood uses the catchcry ?God works in mysterious ways?.<br>The evidence is this sequel. It is unnecessary and disappointing.<br>But the music . . . it might be a good idea to buy the soundtrack CD instead of seeing the film.<br></font></p>
