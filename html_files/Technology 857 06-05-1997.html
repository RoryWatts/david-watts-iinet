            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE of the best HTML editors around keeps getting better. Homesite was recently released in version 2.5 by its new owners, Allaire of Boston. What started as almost a hobby by cartoonist Nick Bradbury has now become big business.<br>Homesite started making a big impression with its first release last year. It came to the Web as free software and impressed quickly as a fast and simple HTML editor which taught new users the language of the Net as well as giving more experienced Web-page creators a tool they could trust.<br>The speed and ease of use have stayed with each release, even though many new features have been added.<br>But unlike its main competitor, HotDog Pro, Homesite has been brought to market with an ever increasing number of toolbars, buttons and applications without becoming cumbersome.<br>Homesite now supports the latest HTML 3.2 standards, including style sheets. It allows users to add Java, ActiveX, varying multimedia files or apps and animations with simple toolbar clicks that lead to easy-to-follow prompts.<br>A click on the add style button, for example, allows the budding author to define body tags quickly, store them and insert them in files.<br>New features aside, it remains the clearest editor to follow, particularly with its in-line browser that shows changes almost instantly.<br>Homesite is not quite a new user's tool. It requires a little knowledge of HTML that can be gained by starting with WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) programs like Navigator Gold or FrontPage and viewing and editing the source of the pages.<br>The trouble with WYSIWYG is that, though it allows easy site creation, it is an inexact science and the HTML can always be improved.<br>Homesite, by comparison, allows total control. And the in-line browser allows constant checking on the result while learning more about hypertext.<br>MR BRADBURY, author of the Dexter comic strip, created Homesite because he found that there were no compelling or capable HTML development tools available.<br>He has navigated Homesite through a time when new HTML editors are released weekly and managed to keep it in front of the pack, winning plaudits from computer magazines and Web reviewers.<br>He said recently he needed the resources of a bigger software firm to support continued growth of his product, and in March sold it to Allaire, makers of ColdFusion server software.<br>Homesite 2.5 is available for trial downloads but costs about $40.<br>Version 1.2, which has fewer features, is free. Unfortunately, both are for Windows95 and NT 4 only.<br>URLs: Homesite: www.dexnet.com/homesite.html.<br>Allaire: www.allaire.com/products/homesite/<br>overview.cfm<br></font></p>
