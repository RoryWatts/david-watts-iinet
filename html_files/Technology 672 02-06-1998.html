            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Web has hundreds of resources devoted to the US Department of Justice fight against Microsoft.<br>Whether the hectares of fact, opinion and gossip make the case and its ramifications any clearer for Netizens is debatable.<br>However, the truth - or at least the chance to be as well informed as is humanly possible - is out there somewhere, .<br>Surfers who want to skip the hype should go straight to the actual Department of Justice anti-trust suit that accuses Bill Gates's company of monopolistic and anti-competitive practices.<br>This document weighs in at 88Kb, or 28 A4 pages, which might sound forbidding. However, for a piece of legal material it is refreshingly simple and to the point despite its length.<br>The suit, and a similar one filed by 20 US States, is available at several sites, but perhaps it is best to look at it at the official DOJ site, which lists all actions against MS, thus giving some context to what is the most important fight facing the computer industry on the verge of the new millennium.<br>Microsoft has rallied strongly to debunk the allegations against it. It has spared no expense in seeking favourable legal opinions to back its claim that the DOJ should have no say in shaping the industry's future.<br>MS claims that anti-trust actions will stifle creativity and innovation and that the DOJ - with its demand that Windows include rival browser Netscape - has no right to determine software design.<br>At the Microsoft Press Pass site the company has all these arguments, plus links to supportive computer writers, to press its case.<br>Global media giant CNN, which continues to be an impressive resource for those seeking more on any big issue, has an excellent site called Target Microsoft. This site packs in the latest news, industry analysis, background and, most importantly, contains an interactive forum that allows users to have their say.<br>The cnet organisation, which maintains dozens of sites devoted to instruction and information on a diverse range of subjects from TV to browser development, has tried to answer the question: How Could the DOJ affect Windows 98? This is an important issue for those considering upgrading when the new OS is released in three weeks.<br>Another major Web presence, ZDNet, has plenty to say about the action and also offers readers an interactive forum. Its link to a surprising survey of browser use tells us that the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows 95 does not necessarily impede Netscape's domination of the market - a key point in the DOJ case.<br>Although MS boss Bill Gates has a reputation on the Net, particularly in Usenet newsgroups, of being the new Satan, the world's richest man has plenty of friends too.<br>Not surprisingly, one of the biggest bands of supporters is made up of businessmen and industrialists who have set up the Committee for the Moral Defence of Microsoft. The site quotes widely from the great pro-capitalist writer Ayn Rand.<br>And as every action has an equal and opposite reaction, the capitalistic view is countered at Netaction, a site calling for consumer activism in exposing Microsoft practices.<br>To play it straight and with an open mind, have a look at the various articles and message boards at the Findlaw site.<br></font></p>
