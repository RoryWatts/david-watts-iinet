            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ANYONE who has used the Web for more than a few weeks will realise it is not devoted entirely to fun.<br>You can read Shakespeare or Jane Austen, catch up on ancient history, check out arcane papers on nuclear physics and tut-tut at the Starr report on President Bill Clinton's sexual misdemeanours.<br>There is a lot more serious stuff as well. But who wants to know? Today, let's look at a few new fun sites that have emerged in recent weeks.<br>A favourite is PoliticalGoo, an Australian site which allows surfers to push politicians around . . . literally.<br>Users select a face from a gallery of politicians - 10 at present - and then push their mouse pointer into parts of the pollies' head. It is not voodoo. As far as I know they are not hurt physically. But if any of them saw what can be done to their smiling images, they might be hurt mentally.<br>It is alarming to know you can even disfigure as gorgeous a face as that of Democrat Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja. Alarming . . . and almost impossible to stop once you've started.<br>Other famous heads include those of Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, his reluctant former deputy Gareth Evans, Liberals Tony Abbott, Amanda Vanstone and Richard Alston, and Independent Brian Harradine.<br>The program that allows their heads to be moulded into whatever shape pleases is known as Kai's Power Tools and is usually found with Adobe Photoshop imaging software.<br>It works interactively on the Web through a Java applet (or program that can be played down the line to any type of computer no matter its operating system).<br>The program works by allowing very small areas of even complicated blocks of colour to be manipulated.<br>The bottom line at PoliticalGoo is that by pushing at Senator Stott-Despoja's mouth (or the mouth of whoever you choose) you can change its shape while you watch.<br>It is even possible to alter just parts of the hairline to ?create? receding lines or even more hair.<br>And ears can get bigger or smaller, as can chins, eyes, mouths and noses. Even Senator Stott-Despoja's lovely dimples can suffer . . . or prosper.<br>A very different sort of fun is derived at The End of the Internet site.<br>The temptation is to take this Canadian site literally. After all, this is what it says: ?You have reached the end of the Internet. You will have to turn around. This is the final directory entry of the easternmost Web server located in the City of St John's, Newfoundland. The Internet's fibre optic junction nodes of North America all have ingoing/outgoing limbs numbering more than one. Except for Newfoundland . . .?<br>By then the penny should drop. Have a look for yourself.<br>Links<br>GooGallery - PoliticalGoo: www.rainbow.net.au/ ~canning/politicalgoo/<br>The End of the Internet: opaldata.com/the_end/index.html<br></font></p>
