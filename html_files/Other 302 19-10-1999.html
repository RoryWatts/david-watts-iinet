            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE November 6 republic referendum has many Australians breathing fire or at least scratching their heads.<br>Why change a workable system, say the monarchists. Why kowtow to a woman in another country, counter republicans.<br>An appointed president would be a political product of Canberra, claim the No voters. A directly elected president would be even more political, counters the Yes camp.<br>And on and on it rages, leaving a cloud of confusion.<br>The question here - as if there were not enough questions already - is whether the Web can be any help in unravelling this issue.<br>I would have to say yes ... then again, I could just as easily say no. A fat lot of good that may be, but it's symptomatic of the way the medium operates.<br>You could spend the whole time being preached to by Web pages that already enshrine your cause. For example, a dedicated republican need never leave the safety of the Australian Republican Movement's site. Ditto for a monarchist and the pages of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy.<br>But if you need to look at the issues to feel better informed so you can make your own judgment, there does seem to be ample material online. The benefit of the Web is that so much archived information from a wide variety of sources is far more accessible than in the real world.<br>The best example of this is the text-rich (Web jargon for not pretty) site called The Australian Republic Issue: A Guide.<br>Subjects on offer include articles analysing and discussing the issues associated with constitutional change; presentations on opposing views; speeches and papers from the 1998 Constitutional Convention; and the full text of the Australian Constitution.<br>If that all sounds a bit heavy going, there are many other sites which might help unfurrow the brow a bit.<br>One of the best places to start is the Sydney Morning Herald Icon site's Queen or Country page.<br>The Government's official Referendum99 site delivers links without comment, so it may be a spot for those who are sick and tired of the rhetoric.<br>As always, the Web has something for those who want to think as little as possible. It is called the Boonie for President site, which presents the case for making former Test cricketer David Boon our head of state.<br>This excerpt from a ?testimonial? by former West Indies fast bowler Joel Garner probably best sums up the site: ?I love Boonie because he is the perfect height for me to rest my beer on his head. I have taken him to many functions in the Caribbean and he was always popular and always well respected.?<br>HELP DESK<br>Queen or Country:<br>www.smh.com.au/icon/9910/16/review3.html<br>The Australian Republic Issue: A Guide<br>www.edfac.usyd.edu.au/staff/souters/republic.html<br>Boonie for President:<br>www.boonieforpresident.com<br>Referendum99:<br>www.referend<br></font></p>
