            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WILL be interesting to put a stopwatch on Thursday's Footy Show to see how much time is devoted to last-placed AFL side Collingwood.<br>A correspondent to the Internet version of the Sam's Mailbag segment claims that the week after West Coast cruised past the Pies at bottle-throwing Victoria Park, the Channel 9 show spent more than 25 minutes talking about the wooden spooners and only 10 previewing six other teams.<br>That figure may or may not be right; I did not have the stopwatch out. But the perception every week is that Collingwood consumes a lot of screen time.<br>This is not really so surprising given that host Eddie McGuire is the club's president and that any number of panellists find Collingwood a cheap target for laughs.<br>McGuire always responds to the taunts and gobbles up more time.<br>Last week, he had a go at Kangaroos supporter Trevor Marmalade for backing a team that had been ?50 points up at half-time but still got rolled? (by Sydney).<br>Marmalade, the show's resident comedian, responded that McGuire's boys were always ?50 points down at half-time and then get rolled?.<br>It was not true, but it was funny. And it meant Collingwood kept hogging the show's limelight.<br>This week, look for more of the same because the Pies nearly won the Anzac Day battle with Essendon.<br>The team, well down on size and experience, played with great passion to get to be just eight points behind. The missed set shot by Anthony Rocca in the dying minutes will no doubt generate a lot of talk.<br>But does Collingwood deserve all this screen time just because its president is also in charge of a national football show?<br>Given the club's great history and its current battles to overcome a horrible start, it certainly is more newsworthy than most.<br>But it is one of 16 teams from around the country, and the lowliest of them at the moment, although the way Fremantle played against Brisbane that dubious honour looks sure to change.<br>The overall effect of this Collingwood obsessiveness is that a lot of teams are skimmed over. Fremantle and Brisbane got just over a minute at the end of last week's show, for example.<br>And the overly Victorian slant of the show - a nationally televised one, remember - was emphasised by the unanimous tipping of Hawthorn to beat West Coast.<br>Glenn Manton, Paul Kelly, Dermott Brereton and Sam Newman appeared uninterested in the Eagles' new look and impressive undefeated start, hardly pausing for thought before going for the Hawks.<br>It was a strong contrast to Seven's Talking Footy three nights earlier which took a long, hard look at how and why the Eagles had been able to pulverise Melbourne glamour team Essendon.<br>Last year, Newman had a strange flirtation with Adelaide after years of bagging the Crows. But for the moment he and the rest of the show seem to have retreated to the confines the other side of the Murray River.<br></font></p>
