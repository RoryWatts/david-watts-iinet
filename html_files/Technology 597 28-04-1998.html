            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The World Wide Web is fast becoming a bottomless pit of both useful and useless information. It looks a daunting place to find homework help, but as DAVID WATTS discovers, there is plenty there, whether you are doing a primary school nature project or a Year 12 English literature essay.<br>After a few years surfing the World Wide Web, the following conclusion is inevitable: It is not only becoming the biggest repository of knowledge in history - it is also easily the worst organised library possible.<br>Given that, it may not look like a fruitful place to help with homework. But, as with anything to do with the Internet, there are two cardinal rules: Don't panic and don't give up.<br>Whether you - as a harassed parent or student - need to know the breeding habits of woylies for a Year 4 project, or would like to spice up a Year 12 essay on Hamlet, chances are the information is available on the Web.<br>1: To search or not to search<br>The customary starting point for many Web surfing sessions is with a search engine such as Yahoo, AltaVista or Lycos.<br>This is not such a good idea if you have a homework project on the boil. Search engines can take you where you want, but generally are too hit-and-miss for homework. The main problem is that results from search engines can seem so scattalogical that you can waste a lot of time calling up irrelevant pages before getting anywhere near what you want. They are best used for homework as a last resort. You need to focus, not surf.<br>Search engines suited to specific topics can be found at cnet's Search.com. The Yahooligans site run by Yahoo is geared towards young people and has extensive educational links, including many to specific homework-related sites in which students who have done assignments using the Web share their knowledge.<br>2: Encyclopaedicknowledge<br>The local library's reference shelves are an excellent place to find homework help - but mainly because you know the books will be well organised. The CD-ROM version of Encyclopedia Britannica, which costs about $300, offers computer users a wonderful resource which might make the local library a bit passe.<br>Other CD encyclopaedias, such as Microsoft Encarta and Colliers, are much less valuable (and less expensive), but can still help with homework.<br>On the Web, the outlook is still not as grand, but it is improving. Britannica can be used online if you are willing to subscribe for roughly $100 a year. Even if you don't subscribe, you can use the limited trial facilities.<br>A cheaper option is Australia's MacquarieNet. For $25 a year, you will have online access to a growing number of resources including the Macquarie Dictionary and thesaurus, international encyclopaedias, Australian encyclopedias, the Australian Associated Press daily news feed, an art gallery of famous Australian paintings and major reference works on Australian history and geography.<br>For free you can use Encyclopedia.com. This site acts like a search engine, using a small but useful encyclopaedia provided by the Electric Library company as its database.<br>The results and resources are hardly on a par with Britannica, but it is fast and free and can provide useful summaries of many topics.<br>3: General reference<br>Desk space is a valuable commodity when much of it is taken by a computer monitor, keyboard, CPU, printer and peripherals. It is difficult to squeeze in a dictionary, thesaurus, atlas and other reference books. However, all these are just a bookmark away on the Web.<br>The WWWebster's Dictionary is - as you might have guessed - the virtual version of the book. Just type in a word, hit enter, wait a little and the answer is there, probably in less time than it takes to leaf through a couple of hundred pages. If you need biographical information about a famous person, try Biography.com, which has short but useful snapshots of 20,000 people.<br>The CIA World Factbook is one of the best all-round reference tools on the Web. It is updated regularly with the 1997 version being the latest online. It covers the politics, history, economics and demographics of every country in the world and has good maps for each.<br>The World Atlas and Geography site refers back to the CIA site for some of its maps. It also uses the National Geographic magazine's resources. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is a number-cruncher's delight. It has all the facts and figures including population, economic indicators and demographics.<br>If you need help with English homework Roget's Thesaurus is online too, as is Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. Both are invaluable study aids, particularly for high school students.<br>Nearly all the above tools, plus quite a few more, are available at the University of NSW Library site.<br>4: Specific subjects<br>English students are well served by the Web, a medium some see as a danger to literacy. But the more you look, the more you will find on the great writers. In particular, William Shakespeare is well represented. His Complete Works are online and there are numerous sites dealing with several of his great plays, as well as one devoted entirely to Shakespearean scholarships.<br>The Internet Classics Archive features, among others, such titles as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the histories of Herodotus, Livy, Tacitus and Thucydides, Plato's Apology, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Aesop's Fables.<br>The Ancient World Web is ideal for history students. It has hundreds of links to subjects as diverse as Australian Aboriginal culture, Vikings, Ireland, world religions and the classical world. If you look hard enough you can even find details of map references made by the Romans in the Middle East before Christ.<br>Regia Anglorum is devoted to English history, especially the times of the Anglo-Saxons, and has dozens of informative links to other sites.<br>The Australian Federal Environment Department runs Erin, which operates best as a search engine on the department's comprehensive database. It is particularly useful for projects on endangered species - remember the woylies?<br>The WA Department of Conservation and Land Management - CALM - has an excellent Web site which offers educational instruction packs for teachers as well as many resources covering the flora and fauna of the State.<br>Perth Zoo has a site with many interesting links to endangered species and education projects.<br>5: Americanisms<br>Americans dominate the Net population and produce the bulk of Web pages. As a result they have developed some good sites dealing specifically with homework. The American concept of K12 (kindergarten to year 12) serves to grade sites to required levels for students.<br>One useful place to visit is the Minneapolis Star-Tribune's Homework Help which runs interactive forums that promise answers to homework questions within 24 hours. The site also has a wealth of links. For example, here are some on maths: 21st Century Problem Solving; Appetisers and Lessons for Math and Reason; Ask Dr Math and Brain Teasers.<br>StudyWeb has a terrific helpmate called the Study Buddy. When clicked, this opens a new window on screen that includes dictionary, encyclopaedia, thesaurus and calculator.<br>Baxter's EduNet includes coverage of the arts, careers, culture, language, magazines and newspapers, maths and technology, the natural sciences, reference libraries and resources, the social sciences, weather and sport. If that is not enough, it also has resources for teachers, educational sites-of-the-week, a pen-pal directory and a search facility.<br>6: Local knowledge<br>The WA Education Department site Serious Stuff is billed as ?the place to search the Internet for information to help you with your homework and projects?. It has links to powerful educational search engines and to Education Network Australia (EdNA).<br>Here you can follow links to co-operative school projects, where students from around the world use the Web to collaborate on projects as diverse as ancient Greece, earthquakes and wild animals.<br>Edsite WA is a local site which has tried to list all State schools on the Net as well as educational resources.<br>And saving one of the best until last, the WWW Virtual Library site at Charles Sturt University is a vast repository. Its highlight is the grading of resources according to educational level - from primary through to post-graduate.<br>Hundreds of links flow from this categorisation. And we've only just begun.<br>HELP DESK<br>1: Search<br>Search.com: www.search.com<br>Yahooligans: www.yahooligans.com<br>2: Encyclopaedic<br>Britannica Online: www.eb.com<br>MacquarieNet: www.macnet.mq.edu.au<br>Encyclopedia.com: www.encyclopedia.com<br>3: Reference tools<br>WWWebster's Dictionary: www.m-w.com/netdict.htm<br>Biographies: www.biography.com<br>CIA World Factbook: www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html<br>Australian Bureau of Statistics: www.statistics.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/homepage<br>World Atlas and Geography: geography.miningco.com/library/maps/blindex.htm<br>Roget's Thesaurus: thesaurus.com<br>Bartlett's Quotations: www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/bartlett<br>University of NSW Reference Tools: www.library.unsw.edu.au/references.html<br>4: Specific subjects<br>Complete Works of Shakespeare: the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/works.html<br>Internet Classics Archive: classics.mit.edu<br>Ancient History: www.julen.net/aw/meta<br>English History: www.ftech.net/ ~regia<br>Erin: Environmental Australia: www.erin.gov.au<br>CALM Nature Base: www.calm.wa.gov.au<br>Perth Zoo: www.perthzoo.wa.gov.au<br>5: American<br>Homework Help: www.startribune.com/stonline/html/special/homework<br>Lots of links: idea.startribune.com/idea/cgi-bin/link<br>StudyWeb: www.studyweb.com<br>Baxter's EduNet: www.baxter.net/edunet/cat/index.html<br>6: Local knowledge<br>WA Education Department (Serious Stuff): www.eddept.wa.edu.au/stseriou.htm<br>EdNA: Education Network Australia: www.edna.edu.au/EdNA<br>Edsite WA: www.edsitewa.iinet.net.au/reference.html<br>WWW Virtual Library: www.csu.edu.au/education/library.html<br>Seventh Day Adventist doctrines: mcdonald.southern.edu/adventis/believe<br>AltaVista: www.altavista.yellowpages.com.au<br>Europress: www.europress.com.au<br>Optus: www.optus.net.au<br>3Com: www.3com.com.au<br>Dataflow: www.dataflow.com.au<br>Logitech: www.logitech.com<br>Acer: www.acer.com.au<br></font></p>
