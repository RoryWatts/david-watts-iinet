            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE protest against Telstra's possible time-charging of Internet calls is spreading on the World Wide Web.<br>At least four sites have been set up either to allow Internet users to join the protest or to inform them of the consequences of timed data calls.<br>The chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia, Perth lawyer Kim Heitman, says in the latest bulletin on the protest that Telstra chief executive Frank Blount's assertion that Internet users are tying up exchanges for up to 24 hours a day is wrong.<br>?There are numerous technical and policy options to fix the alleged congestion of the telephone system,? Mr Heitman said.<br>?The Telstra plan would triple the cost of Internet access to the average user and would be astronomically expensive for active users.<br>?People on low incomes and organisations such as schools and libraries would be forced off the Net, while businesses would simply pass on the costs to customers.?<br>Mr Heitman, urging users to join the protest, said the social costs of timed calls - which Mr Blount predicted would happen next year - would be enormous.<br>He said Telstra was abusing its service obligations and treating customers badly.<br>Organisations supporting the Stop Telstra protest so far are the WA Internet Association, South Australian Internet Association, Electronic Frontiers Australia and the PC Users' Group of the Australian Capital Territory.<br>A protest representative has been appointed in each State to handle e-mail and provide feedback for users, who are also able to protest directly to Telstra at its Web site: www.telstra.com.au/cgi-bin/feedback.<br>The Minister for Communications, Senator Richard Alston, could be e-mailed at minister@dca.gov.au, Mr Heitman said.<br>At the Telstra Timed Calls site, the protest is signalled by a special Stop Telstra logo and Telstra is spelt with a dollar sign - Tel$tra.<br>This helps emphasise the passionate assertions at the site, which include:<br>?The Internet will become even more unattainable to the average citizen.<br>?If you were to sit down and come up with one single action that would cripple the Australian economy and competitiveness in the future, you could not go beyond this.<br>?This grab for your dollar is going to hang like a millstone around the Australian economy in the future.<br>?Freedom of expression will be dead.<br>Mr Heitman has told Net users in previous Stop Telstra bulletins that Telstra has been using a ?straw man? argument by implying that users ?hog? the telephone lines for 24 hours a day.<br>?Of course the average Internet call is much less than an hour,? he said.<br>?EFA feels that if Telstra has a genuine argument based on cost of provision of services then it is time to see it.?<br>URLS:<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia - www.southwest.com.au/~azure/other/efa/<br>FAQ wwwcs.newcastle.edu.au/CSS/stfaq.html<br>Death of the Internet hal9000.net.au/~decker/tel$tra.html<br>Timed data calls wwwcs.newcastle.edu.au/CSS/telstra.html<br></font></p>
