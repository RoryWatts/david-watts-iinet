            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Columbine High School massacre in the US has prompted major Net providers to offer parents tools to limit children's access to Web sites that may contribute to violence.<br>Companies including America Online, Lycos and Yahoo will join a program, initiated by US Vice-President Al Gore, that will see them offering links on their Web pages to tools that monitor the sites their children visit, block access to hate sites and pornography and limit time online.<br>?There are some dark corners, there are some free-fire zones and red-light districts in cyberspace from which children must be protected,? Senator Gore said when he unveiled the Parents' Protection Page program which will be accessible in July.<br>The 15 companies that will take part in the program account for 95 per cent of all US Net traffic. They are: AOL, AT&T, @Home, Bell Atlantic, Commercial Internet Exchange, Disney Online, Excite, Lycos, MCI WorldCom, Microsoft, Network Solutions, Netscape, MindSpring, Prodigy and Yahoo.<br>Senator Gore said no one knew precisely what drove Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to turn on their fellow students with guns and bombs, but suggested the Net was a factor.<br>Harris had a Web site, which is no longer accessible, that bragged he and Klebold had made pipe bombs and reportedly also featured instructions on bomb-making and ways to customise the computer game Doom.<br>At his own Web site last week, Senator Gore provided links designed to help parents as well as to promote the protection program.<br>He also posted an opinion poll, encouraging Web users to put their thoughts on how the US Government might prevent school shootings like the one at Columbine.<br>He asked whether the Government should:<br>? Make gun companies more responsible for the guns they sell.<br>? Create stricter gun control laws for teenagers.<br>? Create programs that allow parents to be more involved in their children's schools.<br>? Work with the entertainment industry to decrease violence in the media.<br>? Increase security at schools.<br>? Make it easier for parents to keep their children's Internet experience positive.<br>Senator Gore's links to tools designed to help parents include ZDnet's Kids Safety Clearinghouse, Netnanny and Cybersitter.<br>He also points out sites where parents can surf with their children in safety. These include the kidscom.com Safety Game site, Families Connect, Ask Jeeves for Kids, yahooligans.com, Lycos Safety Net, supersnooper.com, onekey.com, Classroom Connect and KidsClick.<br>From sites which tell parents about safe surfing, Senator Gore has provided not only the links but also these tips:<br>1. Do not give out personal information such as your full name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, parents work address/telephone number, or the name and location of your school without your parents' permission.<br>2. Tell your parents right away if you come across any information that makes you feel uncomfortable.<br>3. Never agree to get together with someone you ?meet? online without first checking with your parents.<br>4. Never send a person your picture or anything else without first checking with your parents.<br>5. Do not respond to any messages that are mean or in any way make you feel uncomfortable.<br>7. Do not give out your Internet password to anyone (even your best friends) other than your parents.<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority has had a similar site offering hints on family surfing since late last year.<br>HELP DESK<br>Senator Gore's family site:<br>algore2000.com/resources/<br>netfamilies.html<br>ABA guide for<br>Australian families:<br>www2.onlineaustralia.net.au/<br>aba/index.html<br></font></p>
