            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The creators of the Snap Web site are hailing it as the start of a ?totally new Internet?.<br>American Net giant cnet launched Snap just over a week ago, claiming it will become a must entry point for new users and a convenient home page for the experienced.The reaction of users has been mixed, although many correspondents in an online discussion at WellEngaged say Snap may become the USA Today of the Web.Some, such as Jack Schofield, computer editor of the Guardian in London, are worried about the hype surrounding Snap and wonder whether the work needed to maintain the virtual one-stop Web shop can be sustained.<br>Like USA Today, Snap is a sort of personalised newspaper. It has 13 ?channels? covering topics such as computing, health, and travel. And like the American national newspaper, it does nothing in great depth.However, it draws on resources throughout the Web to deliver a constantly updated site that can ease the experience of surfing. It is a little like a department store which has small parts of major specialty stores as its tenants.<br>Snap carries links to pages at CNN, ESPN SportsZone and even competitors such as Ziff Davis Publishing and MSNBC.It throws in links to cnet's other sites such as news.com and download.com but its main thrust is to the big information sites. It also has a browsable directory of Web sites, chat rooms and Internet events.Christopher Barr, cnet's editor in chief, said Snap was born because: ?We didn't see any other service that packaged the whole Internet the way we wanted to use it. Snap Online is a content aggregation service, that is, it gathers the best of the Internet in one easy-to-browse area.?<br>Barr explained that Snap's producers scour the Web every day to uncover the latest information in each category. They summarise what they've found and provide links to related stories and sites, so that users can find nearly anything by checking out a single location.<br>Snap has been set up as an autonomous division within cnet, giving its staff the freedom to direct browsers away from their parent when better information is available from others.<br>HELP DESK<br>Snap: www.snap.com<br>cnet: www.cnet.com<br>WellEngaged discussion about Snap: www.wellengaged.com/engaged/<br>seidman.cgi?c=online&f=0&t=5<br></font></p>
