            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO small words can spell trouble whenever we let them creep into our heads. They are ?what if?.<br>Dusty Springfield sang lustily about ?wishing and hoping? not getting anyone very far. I'm sure she had in mind the phrase ?what if? only it didn't scan that well.<br>When you say those two little words it is often with regret or depression. ?What if I'd won Lotto. What if I'd passed the exam. What if Elle came to life out of the magazine page.?<br>Of course the words can be said with hope and positive energy too. Robert Kennedy almost did that in the eulogy for brother John: ?Some men see things and say "why'; my brother dreamed things and said "why not'.?<br>Almost but not quite. The overall effect of ?what if?, then, is often negative.<br>But sometimes the words can spell fun and fantasy. On the Internet is an intriguing page of information called The World-Village Project. This site has been set up by some bright-spark Americans using information from heavyweight intellectuals like the author of The World From Above, Hans Reich; writer Donella Medows and David Ehrenfeld who penned a tome called The Arrogance of Humanism.<br>Actually I haven't got a clue who any of those people are, but the term heavyweight intellectual trips neatly off the computer cursor. So there.<br>The input from these biggies has gone into shrinking the world, theoretically that is, to try to gain a better understanding of it.<br>To do this they have mathematically reduced the 5 billion-plus population of the globe to just 1000 people, and consequently reduced all other statistics in the same way.<br>Thus, if the world was inhabited by only 1000 people, 165 would speak Mandarin Chinese, 86 English, 83 Hindu, 64 Spanish, 58 Russian and 37 Arabic. Those favourites of the school curriculum French, German and Italian would hardly get a look-in.<br>On Sundays in this world village, 329 people would go to Christian churches ... or not as is often the case. In other parts of town, 178 would be Muslims, 132 Hindus, 62 Buddhists and three Jews. There would be 45 atheists, 167 non-religious, non-atheists, and 86 people would belong to anything from the Elvis is God clan to the Zorastorians to the Druids.<br>The most interesting statistic by far is this: The village would be made up of 584 Asians, 124 Africans, 84 Latin Americans, 95 Europeans, 55 people from what used to be the Soviet Union and 52 North Americans.<br>There would be just four Australians and two New Zealanders - and, no doubt, they would live over the road - or better still the creek - from each other.<br>This puts into perspective what a little country we are, people-wise. But what I want to know is which four Australians?<br>You could gather some interesting combinations. Try these for starters: Graeme Campbell, Pauline Hanson, Bruce Ruxton and Bronwyn Bishop. I'm assuming they are two couples, otherwise we could have the Oarsome Foursome or the old Mean Machine Olympic relay swimmers. And what would the neighbours think.<br>So back to combinations. We could have Richard Court, Carmen Lawrence, Jeff Kennett and Ros Kelly; or Paul Keating, Amanda Vanstone, John Howard and Cheryl Kernot.<br>I say we could have these combos, but I don't think it would be long before Kiri Te Kanawa and Richard Hadlee had to come over and mediate.<br>But then, would things be better if the four Aussies were Rolf Harris, Paul Hogan, Dame Joan Sutherland and Diane Cilento? I think not. Rolf's didgeridoo would interfere in Dame Joan's vital arias and Hoges would try to cook and eat half Ms Cilento's precious wildlife.<br>How about Nicole Kidman, Mel Gibson, Bryan Brown and Kimberley Davis? No ... too many egos for the house probably.<br>I could say the perfect setup would be an Australian house with Elle Macpherson, me and I wouldn't really care who else. I could say that, but the wife would kill me.<br></font></p>
