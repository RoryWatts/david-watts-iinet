            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Kids (R)<br>Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloe Sevigny<br>Directed by Larry Clark<br>Luna Cinemas<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>PEOPLE with middle class sensibilities should take a psychiatrist with them when they see Kids. Being of rural working class background I could afford only a school psychologist.<br>In a state of shock after this raw documentary-like drama about disaffected youth, I asked the psychologist whether the scenes of Kids could happen in Perth.<br>She sent me reeling by saying they were commonplace in certain areas.<br>Kids is set in Manhattan's East side over a 24-hour period ... the hottest day of the year in fact. What happens in that 24 hours will have most people's hair standing on end.<br>To start with a gangly, fairly ugly 17-year-old youth called Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) deflowers a girl lucky to be 15.<br>Gangs of boys loll around an apartment smoking dope, inhaling laughing gas and drinking while keeping up a noisy, almost incomprehensible but profane discourse about girls and sex. These boys range from about 11 to 18.<br>A group of 15- and 16-year-old girls talk in a similar profane way about boys and sex.<br>Gangs of boys hang out in Central Park, scoring drugs, drinking, smoking their heads off and threatening homosexuals.<br>When a black man banters with one of the gang, Casper (Justin Pierce), for one second too long, the gang sets on him, thrashing him to a pulp. We don't find out whether he dies.<br>A quartet of pre-teens sits smoking joint after joint and talking absolute rubbish as all around them their big brothers and sisters smoke, drink, take drugs and fornicate.<br>A girl, so drunk, doped and depressed by the news that her only sexual encounter - with Telly - has left her HIV positive, is raped by Casper while unconscious.<br>That is only 24 hours. What do they get up to tomorrow? The truth is the kids of Kids don't believe in tomorrow. There is only the moment, and these teenagers have learnt a brutal way of life.<br>Kids is like looking into the eyes of a tiger snake. It's repulsive and deadly, but at the same time fascinating and compelling.<br>Debutant director Larry Clark, a noted US photographer with a liking for the dark side of life, got the idea for the movie after talking to a skateboarding 19-year-old named Harmony Korine.<br>Korine wrote the story he told Clark in three weeks; Clark got together a group of non-professionals ... very young non-professionals ... and Kids was the result.<br>Using mostly hand-held camera and tight grainy shots, Clark has delivered a European rather than American film.<br>It is so un-Hollywood and so brutal, it makes other teen shockers look like Disney movies.<br>Korine's plot, if you can call it that, concerns Jennie (Chloe Sevigny), the girl who contracts HIV from her first sex act with Telly.<br>Telly's only calling in life is to deflower virgins, so Jennie tries to get to him before he spreads more disease.<br>That's it really; all set in the honking, hot, dirty streets of New York.<br>On the Richter scale of adjectives, Kids scores the following: shocking - definitely; brutal - absolutely; distressing - emphatically; confronting - always; worrying - tremendously; unnecessary - the jury's out.<br></font></p>
