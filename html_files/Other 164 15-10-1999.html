            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MY conscience has got the better of me. The parts of last week's column that dealt with the width of standard gauge railways being determined by the size of two horses' bottoms were almost certainly . . . and I'll put this as gently as possible . . . bollocks.<br>I cited an e-mail chain letter that claimed the width of railway tracks was based on older wagon widths which had to fit the wheel tracks of ancient roads built by the Romans for their war chariots.<br>The chariots were as wide as the behinds of the two horses towing them.<br>It was typical Internet chain letter material - probably a lie wrapped in the veneer of a mildly convincing story.<br>Reader Rick Boyd was not fooled and pounced immediately. ?The Romans did not use war chariots. They used chariots only for racing. Four feet eight inches does not accommodate two horses' arses or anything like it. Romans used paved roads and not dirt tracks full of ruts,? he wrote.<br>Mr Boyd's main reason for writing, however, was to pour some gentle scorn on my ribbing of New Zealanders earlier in the column. He made plain he is a Kiwi with the salutation ?gudday Dave?.<br>He mentioned a few unmentionable things about cricket and ended on this note: ?Why else was NZ DB beer advertised as "Bitter as a losing Aussie'??<br>Fair bump, play on. Now then, if the width of horses' bottoms sounded possibly true but was probably absolute rot, the revelations I have today may sound off the planet. What follows does not come from an e-mail chain letter, but from the September edition of the Journal of Neuroscience. Moreover, the journal's rather densely reported findings about Reconstruction of Natural Scenes from Ensemble Responses in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus have been picked up as a major feature story by the BBC in London.<br>To get straight to the point, the BBC reports that scientists at the University of California in Berkeley have wired a computer to a cat's brain and created videos of what the animal was seeing.<br>The BBC's Web site has pictures from the experiment that show the original version of the object the cat was looking at, then the computer images thrown up on a screen wired to the cat's brain. One set of pictures shows a man's face. The cat's-eye view shows a very fuzzy approximation of the same. You can't see any fine detail, but you could say it was a face seen through a dirty and rain-spattered windscreen.<br>The fuzziness exists because the researchers attached electrodes to only 177 cells in the so-called thalamus region of the cat's brain and monitored their activity. (The thalamus is connected directly to the cat's eyes via the optic nerve).<br>Talk about seeing the world through someone else's eyes. Where will it all end? The way technology is developing it might only be a matter of years before we can wire up anyone's thalamus and record what they see on a tiny video cassette inserted through a neat hole in their heads.<br>A black market trade could develop in swiped video cassettes. For one, a lot of blokes would pay big money for access to what soccer star David Beckham sees through his own eyes - Posh Spice in her underwear. Some may even prefer his footballer-eye view of a Manchester United game. There's no accounting for taste.<br>Possibilities for sneak peeks at private lives abound. Imagine what the following cassettes might show:<br>Kim Beazley - shadowy images of Paul Keating.<br>Jeff Kennett - himself preening before a mirror.<br>Richard Court - a horizon resplendent in bell towers.<br>John Elliott - a fug of cigarette smoke and a video that jerks constantly because of coughing.<br>Jonah Lomu - a wide open path to the try line interrupted only by some insignificant 80kg English weeds.<br>Mick Malthouse - Eddie McGuire.<br>It all goes to show that truth can be stranger than fiction . . . or something like that.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
