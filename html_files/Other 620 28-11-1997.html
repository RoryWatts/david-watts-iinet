            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONVERSATION, possibly overheard in a pub yesterday: Bloke 1: G'day. Did you see Schindler's List last night?<br>Bloke 2: Yeah, mate, I cried buckets. Those poor Jews were shot like dogs; no, it was worse than dogs. It was awful and powerful.<br>Bloke 1: You cried, geez mate, have a beer. It was only a film.<br>Bloke 2: Thanks mate I will. It might have been a film, but those things really happened. How could people have been so cruel?<br>B1: Really happened? Geez. Did you see Pauline Hanson's videotape, you know the one she wants released if she's assassinated.<br>B2: Yeah. But it didn't really happen, did it. I mean she's not dead yet. So we saw her speaking from beyond the grave when she's really still alive.<br>B1: What about the Spice Girls mate? They're everywhere. You can't open a paper without seeing them. Turn on the TV and there they are.<br>B2: Yeah, I guess there a bit of a 90s phenomenon all right. Nice firm flesh and good legs too.<br>B1: Just like a horse, hey! Only they make squillions more and get bigger crowds than any horse race.<br>B2: That's because they show their knickers. You'll always get a bigger crowd when you show your knickers. Horses can't, can they? They haven't got any knickers.<br>B1: Who are they anyway?<br>B2: Well I believe they were born two years ago - as a group, not as people, they're not the Hansons. A British promoter picked them from an open audition based on their looks and spunkiness. None is a professional singer or dancer - unless you count strip-club experience.<br>B1: Yeah, but what are their names?<br>B2: Well there's Geri who's called Ginger or Sexy Spice. She looks a little like a rabbit and was a stripper and a chat show host on Turkish TV.<br>B1: So she can talk turkey mate?<br>2: Good one. No, I don't know much about that, but there's pictures of her nude on the Internet I hear. Then there's Emma who's known as Baby Spice because she's the youngest, though there are rumours she is really 32.<br>B1: I'd like to be 32.<br>B2: And Victoria, she's called Posh Spice because her dad is rich but she's really a suburban girl. The Tories voted her their favourite Spice Girl, would you believe. They take them that seriously in Pommieland.<br>B1: And are there two with the same name? Only one's black and the other's not.<br>B2: Yeah, that would be Mel B and Mel C. I think Mel B is called Scary and was the British Labour Party's favourite and Mel C is Sporty.<br>B1: So what do they sing?<br>B2: Poppy stuff you can bop to like Wannabe and Naked and Who Do You Think You Are. Mind you I've never seen or heard one right through. They always seem to be only sound grabs.<br>B1: Like politicians on the steps of Parliament House?<br>B2: Yeah, nothing of substance, keeps the attention span short, nothing very serious or deep.<br>B1: Do you know the words?<br>B2: To a politician's sound grab, yeah. ?I can't recall? or ?No comment?.<br>B1: No, the Spice Girls' songs.<br>B2: I knew that. Well you can't really have a go at them. We danced to Chewy, Chewy, Chewy after all.<br>B1: Maybe you did mate; I preferred country.<br>B2: What, like Mamma Grab a Hammer There's a Fly on Daddy's Head?<br>B1: But can they really sing?<br>B2: Some people think so. I asked a group of people the other day. Their answers ranged from ?Who?? to ?Shane Warne's better? (figure that one), to ?As well as the Statue of Liberty?. But a lot said they could.<br>B1: What do you reckon?<br>B2: Who cares. They won't be round much longer; not like real singers, like Frank Sinatra or Luciano Pavarotti.<br>B1: Beer?<br>B2: Maaate.<br>This is B1 (and B2) signing off. I'll stop talking to myself soon, I promise doctor.<br></font></p>
