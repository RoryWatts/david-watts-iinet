            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AN OLD schoolmate is a nostalgia buff, particularly where popular music is concerned. For 20 years he has rung me regularly to ask such questions as: ?Who replaced Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones??<br>Because he lives in Queensland, the cost of these calls became prohibitive. If the questions were asked in the past few years, it was only in the dead of night and under the influence.<br>But now my mate is on the Net and can satisfy his thirst for trivia via e-mail.<br>The difference now is that I have the upper hand. If he asks what band sang about moving pieces around a chessboard? I can reply in less than an hour with the name of the band (Yes), its personnel, the song title (Your Move), the complete lyrics, and an exhaustive biography and discography.<br>It drives my mate mad. He knows I have not suddenly become a very clever person ... he has known me too long for that.<br>But the art of searching the Net - the song questions are answered with almost indecent ease at the Ultimate Band List site - and making the computer do what it is asked, are new and mysterious skills for my friend.<br>He is new enough to them to believe they are logical beasts. On the other hand, I have worked with computers for 19 years and know they are run by the little green men inside them. I can divine the runes, but more importantly go straight to a relevant URL.<br>My mate will be able to do that one day, but in the meantime probably faces some serious sessions of keyboard banging, shouting at his PC, and maybe even kicking it.<br>Most people who have driven a computer are familiar with the rage that builds up when a program fails to respond or the system crashes. I started using computers in November 1980, and thumped my first keyboard in about January 1981.<br>Hundreds of people have been telling stories of their computer rage at a special BBC site set up a week ago to coincide with the release of survey results, conducted by the Mori organisation and aptly entitled Rage against the Machine.<br>The survey of 1250 British IT workers showed that four out of five computer users had seen colleagues hurling abuse at their PCs. Three-quarters admitted that they swore at their computers. And nearly half of all people working with computers said they felt frustrated or stressed because of IT problems. Adding to the frustration was the support personnel's jargon.<br>The BBC must have had a bad week with its system because three days after the computer rage survey it reported the results of another survey that revealed that many workers were troubled by their wired workplaces.<br>The survey said office workers complained their work was interrupted every 10 minutes by telephones, faxes and e-mails.<br>My system is running low on memory so I had better file this before the system crashes.<br>#@%** computers, who needs them!<br>HELP DESK<br>Ultimate Band List: www.ubl.com<br>BBC rage page: news2.thdo.bbc.co.uk/<br>hi/english/business/the<br>-economy/newsid-35<br></font></p>
