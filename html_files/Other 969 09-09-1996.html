            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YEAH, thanks Len Findlay. Just because you spent seven years filling this space every day with enlightenments, you think you can just skive off, don't you.<br>But it is the start of the finals season for goodness sake, and even a Scotsman would know that; particularly one who barracks for poor, bedevilled Hawthorn (or Melthorne or Hawbourne, or whatever they'll become).<br>So you know exactly what you've done ... left me to chirrup on about stuff that no one will be interested in. All attention is turned to footy.<br>Well from my perspective it is. Here are some facts about me so you can gauge that perspective.<br>I am a 42-year-old bloke. Enough said.<br>At this time of the year a woman can come home and announce to stunned-mullet-in-front-of-TV man: ?Darling I'm pregnant.?<br>Reply: ?That bloody Wayne Carey; he should go for that.?<br>Or ... flustered shopped-out wife: ?Honey I've just bought this wonderful $15,000 sofa from Peter Costello's Rip-Off Barn, what do you think??<br>Honey: ?Ah, come on ump, Silvagni's been doing it all day; in the back you peanut. Another can would be welcome my love.?<br>You see, it's not easy. But then that's my excuse. It doesn't quite rate in the ?dog ate my homework? league, but there it is.<br>However, here are some excuses that do rate. They were written by US parents and sent to me by a friend who swears the magazine she got them from swears they are all genuine:<br>?My son is under a doctor's care and should not take P.E. today. Please execute him.?<br>?Please excuse Lisa for being absent. She was sick and I had her shot.?<br>?Dear School: Please ekscuse John being absent on Jan. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and also 33.?<br>?Please excuse Roland from P.E. for a few days. Yesterday he fell out of a tree and misplaced his hip.?<br>?Please excuse Ray Friday from school. He has very loose vowels.?<br>I could go on. In fact I will. ?Irving was absent yesterday because he missed his bust.?<br>?Please excuse Jennifer for missing school yesterday. We forgot to get the Sunday paper off the porch, and when we found it Monday, we thought it was Sunday.?<br>This one is surely a senior student. ?My daughter was absent yesterday because she was tired. She spent a weekend with the Marines.?<br>And I think this one takes the cake. ?Maryann was absent December 11-16, because she had a fever, sore throat, headache and upset stomach. Her sister was also sick, fever and sore throat. Her brother had a low grade fever and ached all over. I wasn't the best either, sore throat and fever.<br>?There must be something going around. Her father even got hot last night.?<br>???<br>WE HAVE a funny set of values really. Hospitals, schools, homes for the elderly and medical research are all crying out for money. And the way our present leaderships work, these institutions will turn to the public more and more for that money.<br>A figure of $7,707,634 would buy a lot of medical equipment and staff more than a few rundown schools. But funnily enough Australians spent that $7,707,634 in just one weekend - August 31, September 1 - on one thing that won't change their lives or do one bit of good for anyone except a few who are mostly well-heeled already.<br>That was the amount spent at the box office to see the movie Independence Day, according to the Motion Picture Distributors' Association of Australia.<br>I admit I went to see what all the fuss was about and moderately enjoyed the film. But I was staggered to see a group of 13-14 -year-olds leaving the cinema, chanting ?USA, USA?. No doubt they put their baseball caps on backwards and headed straight for a video arcade.<br>Unlike the movie, it makes you think.<br></font></p>
