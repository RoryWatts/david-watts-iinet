            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE other day I followed a car driven by a woman. On the bumper was a sticker which said: ?My other car is a broom.?<br>That has nothing to do with what I am writing about today ? just thought you'd like to know.<br>Did you know that if male politicians take Viagra they grow taller? I don't get it, and it may or may not have anything to do with what I want to write about today.<br>And that is sex, or the Channel 10 program Sex/Life which has been axed after pressure from Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston.<br>Back in late May, Senator Alston was quoted as saying: ?I think the entire community is concerned about the proliferation of what seem to be increasingly prurient programs on both radio and television. You could be forgiven for thinking television and radio programmers have taken a dose of Viagra.? (Maybe he gets the one about politicians).<br>Programs such as Sex/Life particularly concerned him. I've hardly seen it - and probably never will - but apparently people take their clothes off and, as children would say, do things.<br>The show also is said to spice up sex education with segments about male-male, female-female, indeed the whole catalogue of what Senator Alston believes is unfit for human consumption on a medium that delights in showing shocking violence and tawdry drama.<br>I just wonder ? has Senator Alston really stopped to think about what is actually offensive to people on TV?<br>I have some candidates that I would like passed on to him:The guy in the AAPT Smart Chat ad.<br>This smug lad talks like a machine-gun and keeps ringing some bloke called Nobby who has nicked off overseas, according to the smug one's trendy Fil-o-fax that he produces, along with a cordless or mobile phone like some merchant banker in a West Perth wine bar.<br>What is particularly irritating about him and his ad - apart from the fact he has no idea where Namibia is - is that every now and then he poses in front of a picture of the Perth skyline which does not even have the city's biggest building, Central Park.<br>Thus it is probably about 10 years old and if you look closely enough you might make out R&I, or even the ancient rune, Bond, on the BankWest tower.<br>What is more, the guy in this ad pops his smarmy head in at every opportunity during sporting shows like Talking Footy. If Bruce McAvaney and Leigh Matthews hadn't already driven you to distraction by analysing how bad the Eagles and Dockers were, then Mr AAPT would assure at least a couple of kicked-in TVs.The girl in the Cherry Ripe ad.<br>Sort of gorgeous in a slightly chubby way. But she does everything in her power to ensure that the 80s creed of Greed is Good is adhered to.<br>She is not content with scoffing her boyfriend's Cherry Ripe while they are out driving but she uses every ruse in the book to raid his room and steal one he has been saving.<br>She talks with her mouth full while ripping off the poor boyfriend, who looks like he might be the slightly cuddlier brother of Mr Smart Chat.<br>Maybe he is Nobby.Anyone in an ad for a small car.<br>I don't care if it's a Festiva or a Daewoo or a Billy Cart, every small car appears to be designed specifically for 20 or 30-something young women with attitude.<br>Thus they flatten lines of Harley-Davidsons, or shout about no compromises and smart buys.<br>If they are such powerful girls with big, winning attitudes, why aren't they driving BMWs instead of looking smug behind the steering wheel of an enclosed sewing machine?<br>Granted it is a short list, but any one of the above is far more offensive than a dose of titillation Senator Alston.<br></font></p>
