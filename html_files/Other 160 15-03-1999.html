            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PRIME Minister John Howard should have known better. But last week when he took up arms for Baywatch against the people of Sydney's Avalon Beach - who had told the world's most-watched TV show where to shove its skimpy, lycra swimsuits - he was siding with the devil.<br>If Mr Howard was more digitally minded he would have surfed the Internet and found an awful truth available to millions of tech-savvy people around the world.<br>David Hasselhoff, Baywatch's creator, is the anti-Christ. It says so right at a Web site called, appropriately enough, David Hasselhoff is the AntiChrist. The site's creator, American Warren S Appel, has published several pages of evidence, most of which relies on quotes from the Bible, particularly the Revelation of St John.<br>His first bit of proof, however, is quite startling in its simplicity.<br>?Add a little beard and a couple of horns - David Hasselhoff looks like the Devil, doesn't he?? Mr Appel writes.<br>For Biblical proof, he has drawn up a series of tables with quotes from Revelation answered by his own interpretations. All condemn Hasselhoff.<br>For example, from Revelation 13:1 ?And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns?.<br>Mr Appel deduces: ?The beast, of course, is David Hasselhoff. The heads are his television incarnations - Young and the Rest-less, Revenge of the Cheerleaders, Knight Rider, Terror at London Bridge, Ring of the Musketeers, Baywatch and Baywatch Nights.<br>?Ten horns represent his musical releases . . . and not only does Mitch, the lifeguard, literally rise out of the sea on Baywatch, but David's musical career has mostly occurred in Europe, a metaphoric rise to fame from across the sea.?<br>He has much more beside, including a complicated chart to prove Hasselhoff bears the number of the beast, 666. But the expose ends not with a bang but a whimper. Mr Appel wimps out with: ?Hope you've had fun with this Web page, and I hope you don't take me too seriously.?<br>He salvages some pride with a link to a list of things people learn about Americans by watching Baywatch. For example:American men and women spend 15 per cent of their days running in slow motion along the beach.Americans almost drown an average of two times each hour.People in the US look thoughtfully at the ocean for an average of 15 seconds after being told anything of any importance.When swimming in California, you are more likely to be attacked by jewel thieves or taken hostage by terrorists than you are to drown.<br>The list was written by Eric Spitznagel and Brendan Baber and will be included in their book, Planet Baywatch: The Unofficial Guide To the New World Order. The list first appeared in Playboy magazine. The anti-Christ site is one of hundreds on the Web which feed off Baywatch. The Baywatch Web Ring, which links sites thematically, has 108 entries.<br>On closer examination, most of these are celebrity skin sites, the type that show pictures of female stars in skimpy, or no, bathers . . . a bit like Baywatch itself.<br>The show has its own official site, but has little to say about the Avalon Beach fracas.<br>At a link called Baywatch Beaches Australia, it has a virtual advertisement for a travel package to Sydney from the US. The ad is full of pictures of the Baywatch cast in yellow cossies and shows them on the Harbour Bridge.<br>In small print at the bottom, the ad notes: ?Actual filming of Baywatch will not be occurring during your visit.?<br>Links:<br>David Hasselhoff is the AntiChrist: www.esquilax.com/baywatch/<br>Official Baywatch site: www.baywatch.com<br>Baywatch links: www.ultimatetv.com/UTVL/utl.html?1228&old<br></font></p>
