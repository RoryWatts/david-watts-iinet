            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LIFE can be a wild roller-coaster at times, but there are many certainties to depend on. The sun rises, it sets, Mick Malthouse thinks the Eagles are lazy (tut-tut, only an eight-goal win), some people hate Pauline Hanson, some love her.<br>You can bet when someone receives an overseas phone call they'll say: ?It's (insert time) here, what time is it there??<br>If two boys are playing with a walkie-talkie device, one or both will always be heard to say: ?Where are you now??<br>Other certainties concern animals. Formally introduced dogs will sniff each other's bottoms until happy or otherwise with the outcome.<br>It is also a good bet that your household pet will die sometime before you do. They have short lives but rich ones ... all those bottoms to sniff for a start.<br>Often the death of a pet moggy, puppy or even budgie will be the first grave lesson about death that a child experiences. Adults are often badly affected, particularly if their dog, say, has given them 10 years of loyal, friendly service.<br>Indeed the big difference between a dog and a wife is that the dog is happier to see you the later you come home.<br>But it is not ordinary household pets I want to talk about, rather the extraordinary animals that in their separate ways became global pets through film or television.<br>Sadly, like all pets, they are dead. But their names still guarantee fame.<br>Let's start with Roy Rogers' horse Trigger. Did you know the late Trigger is the star attraction at the Roy Rogers/Dale Evans Museum in Evansville, California?<br>That great TV and movie cowboy Roy is still alive and often at the museum - but most people still head straight for the mounted hide of the golden palomino. They are drawn to the shrine by an eight-metre high fibreglass model of Trigger outside.<br>And there are plans for a new museum where a 30-metre statue with blazing laser-lit eyes and an electronic whinny are on the drawing board.<br>Trigger, who Rogers rode in every show he made, died, at 33 in 1965. His hide was stretched over a plaster likeness and put on display, rearing on two legs, inside the museum.<br>N EXT pet off the rank is Rin Tin Tin, the brave dog star of silent American movies who almost single-handedly rescued Warner Brothers studios from poverty in the early 1920s. At the height of his fame Rinty received 2000 fan letters a week.<br>Rinty is buried in the Cimetie're des Chiens in Paris. That's France, not Texas. The tombstone for the star of films such as Jaws of Steel and The Man from Hell's River is made of black onyx, with a gold-leafed ?star of the cinema? inscription.<br>Why France for such an American icon? You see Rin Tin Tin was a shell-shocked pup found in the French trenches during World War I. His saviour, Lee Duncan, took Rinty home to the US after the war. But when he died aged 16 in 1933, France took him back. His bloodline thrived. Some of his US-born descendants played Rin Tin Tin in the 1950s TV series.<br>Last on this fascinating journey is the chortling star of the 1960s TV series, Flipper, whose real name was Mitzi. Mitzi was 24 when she died in 1972. After her death it emerged Mitzi was a lousy tail-walker .<br>These tricks were done by a male stunt double called Mr Gripper. But she did nudge boats to safety, knocked guns out of poachers' hands with well-timed leaps and warned Bud and Sandy of lurking danger.<br>Mitzi's female progeny have turned out to be lousy tail-walkers too.<br>Phew; I'm glad I got all that off my chest. One cannot allow important information like this to go unreported.<br></font></p>
