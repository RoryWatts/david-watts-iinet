            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Brain<br>Desktop utility<br>Download: www.natrificial.com<br>Platform: Windows 95, 98 or NT<br>Price: 30-day free demo, then $US49.95<br>A popular misconception about computers is that they have some intelligence that allows them to work like a brain. It just isn't so. The best that can be said is that computers are lightning-fast idiots which take their instructions from us, the meatware.<br>US company Natrificial (for natural and artificial) Software Technologies is trying to give the brain analogy some tangible meaning, however, with the release of The Brain, a desktop utility designed for easy and efficient work.<br>The Brain takes a bit of getting used to. But used properly it can develop just like a real human brain and personalise the home computing experience to an extent not possible when navigating through folders, wizards and Start buttons.<br>Natrificial has designed The Brain to ape a user's work habits, giving them quick access to the functions they might otherwise have to fumble around for.<br>This requires a lot of user participation. After all, a real brain will not gain wisdom or experience by just lying idle.<br>The organisation of daily functions is accomplished by creating ?thoughts? which stem from a central part or plex of the brain, which typically bears the user's name.<br>For example: Your name is Jim, so the brain you create is called Jim. From Jim you can create thoughts about your various computing activities. These thoughts will be cells of information which have links to applications or documents you commonly use.<br>Say you use your PC for work and for play. You can run thoughts from Jim called Work and Play.<br>In Work you might create other thoughts, such as Internet (if you need to access it for work) and Documents. In each of these you can embed links to the programs you use to perform your work, like Netscape or Eudora or dialling your ISP.<br>In Documents you could place a link to the folder containing your work.<br>So when you open Jim, you could follow a thread to Work, then another to Internet and click open what you need.<br>Within that simple framework is the almost endless capability to create new thoughts and link them back and forth.<br>The user interface looks a little like jellyfish with names.<br>Click on one to see what it links to, then click on it to enter a different sphere of computing activity from which it is very simple to get back where you started.<br>It is a conceptual and spatial tool rather than a linear one and may be the foretaste of graphical user interfaces to come.<br></font></p>
