            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN THE words of John Cleese in the Dead Parrot sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus: I wish to register a complaint.<br>Only an insomniac could find any joy in watching midweek sport on free-to-air television.<br>SBS was the only station this week to provide sport at a decent hour - before 10.30pm - with its good World Sports show.<br>One-day cricket from India; the World Series baseball finals, severely delayed, and anything else did not appear until after midnight.<br>If you are fortunate enough to have pay-TV, you would have been able to watch the one-dayers live as well as see live coverage of the Wallabies rugby union matches in Scotland to the accompaniment of those wonderfully rich accents.<br>Complaint over, let's look at the positives.<br>Channel Ten brightened up Friday night with game two of the NBL grand final series. Ten does well on basketball, but I doubt the wisdom of screening the game against Nine's sexy Sharon Stone thriller, Basic Instinct.<br>Still, there was plenty of fury and, for a non-contact sport, lots of elbows and hip and shoulders.<br>The South-East Melbourne Magic's 88-84 win over the Melbourne Tigers was also full of contradictions.<br>The Tigers played with fire and ferocity, particularly centre Mark Bradtke, who almost took John Dorge out of the game early in the second quarter. Yet, coach Lindsay Gaze was relaxed and cool as a cucumber. The only time he lost it was when son Andrew was ordered off under the blood rule and there was no blood.<br>Magic coach Brian Goorjian was all emotion, blood and brimstone. His eyeballs stood out, he sweated and snarled; he yelled and was always on the verge of exploding. Yet, his team kept its cool, proving the value of defence.<br>The game was not pretty with lots of turnovers and missed chances, but the intensity made top viewing.<br>By sad contrast, yesterday's decider was almost boring. The Magic built on its cool, defensive efforts and added good attack, thrashing the Tigers 108-70.<br>Ten also had the best sport on Saturday with blanket coverage of Victoria Derby day from Flemington. It wasn't bad as a lead-up to tomorrow's big day. But Ten missed the start of the important Mackinnon Stakes because of a commercial break ... not a good sign.<br>Otherwise the Ten crew, though just as numerous, was far less intrusive than Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports team had been at Moonee Valley and Caulfield.<br>Tim Webster was a relaxed and affable anchor, Perth's Tim Gossage stood tall in the betting ring and Sandra Sully found Priscilla Presley when she went looking at the women's hats.<br>Bright spark Tim Bailey found a Vietnamese comedian who claimed he had ?put his money on the triad?, and a man dressed as a wizard who gave a comical call of tomorrow's cup that had to be abandoned when his brain kept switching channels.<br>Pity, but excellent camera work earlier showed that Circles Of Gold put in the best cup preparation.<br></font></p>
