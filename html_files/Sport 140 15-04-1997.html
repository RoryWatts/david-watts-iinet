            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE glorious uncertainty of sport has rarely been better illustrated than in the past five or six days.<br>Unfortunately, the inglorious uncertainty of whether the humble TV viewer can see it has also been well proved.<br>Let's start with Michael Bevan's series-winning century in the one-day cricket against South Africa. Lara-like, the talented New South Welshman glided and belted Australia home from what seemed an impossible position.<br>Steve Waugh, though less imposing, was a determined anchor for Bevan's heroics. Then stand-in skipper Ian Healy hoisted the winning runs in one of the great chases of one-day history.<br>No one looked happier than his rival Adam Gilchrist at the other end. Indeed, Gilchrist's 77 in an earlier match was probably the fighting innings that showed the Australians they could beat this very good team of South Africans.<br>Equally good was Tiger Woods' 12-stroke thrashing of the US Masters golf field. No one went close to the gifted youngster in the last three rounds, and some champions say golf courses might have to be redesigned to make Woods less of a superman.<br>Channel 7's Jack Newton had even offered before the tournament to strip off if Woods won the Masters. Like a lot who had only seen his brash talent fail to reach great heights in Australia, Newton regarded a Woods' win as impossible.<br>Thankfully, Newton welched on his wager, telling Bruce McAvaney on Sunday that he did not think anyone wanted to see him in the nude.<br>Unless you were an all-night party animal, late-shift worker or insomniac, you would not have seen either of these great sporting feats. The golf was on Nine about 5am, and the cricket, on Seven, went from late night until very early morning with highlights at 9.30am.<br>A third memorable sporting event, Octagonal's last race, was on Nine at an ideal time, 1.10pm on Saturday, but the blood and thunder of St Kilda versus Collingwood on Seven made it very hard to flick the remote.<br>Of all the good sport at the weekend, the Saints' unlikely seven-point win was hard to beat as the best televisual spectacle.<br>On a sunny afternoon in front of 55,000 people, the Saints and the Magpies forgot about video tribunals and mixed it like they were in the grand final. Nicky Winmar walked the fine line between spirited brilliance and animal aggression all day and, happily for St Kilda, the brilliance won.<br>Not far behind was Port Adelaide's first full TV outing here. What Port showed by drubbing a forlorn Geelong was that it was not going to be easybeats in its first year, and next week's Adelaide derby against the Crows will be a game to look forward to.<br>Our own derby fizzled, unfortunately. The Dockers have not learnt that kicking goals is what the game is all about.<br>It seems useless to control long passages of play only to score points. West Coast could have been rattled but all it needed to do was be patient and the accuracy and skills did the rest.<br>?It was appropriate last week that I wrote about people putting their feet in their mouths. I lumped Wayne Carey in with the knee reconstructions. It is his shoulder, of course.<br></font></p>
