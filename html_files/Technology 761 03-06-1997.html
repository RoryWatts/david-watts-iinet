            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE has unveiled what it hopes will be its newest weapon in the browser war with Microsoft.<br>Netcaster is its version of the push technology that delivers Web sites to both the desktop and hard drive with minimal intervention from users.<br>Unfortunately WestWeb cannot get it to work, despite having adequate hardware - a 133 Pentium and 24Mb of RAM.<br>The program looks elegant, not unlike Microsoft Encarta's interface, and promises to go out and fetch content from CNN, ABC in the US, Wired magazine and CBS sport, among others.<br>But it keeps crashing, throwing an invalid page fault.<br>Netcaster will be central to the new version 4.0 Communicator Net package when it is officially released in the next few months.<br>At the moment it is in pre-release or beta mode, like the rest of the Communicator line, which last week came out in its fifth version - without Netcaster.<br>Netscape says Netcaster allows users to subscribe to ?channels? - specially prepared Web sites - and download them directly to the desktop, which it terms the Webtop.<br>The channels can be updated at user-defined intervals, meaning that Netcaster will download new pages automatically and dis play them on screen if required.<br>???<br>BEATRICE'S Web Guide is a joint site of Women's Wire and Yahoo, the Internet search-and-catalogue company, which purports to bring you to ?only the good stuff?.<br>It has an extensive ?list of lists?, and Beatrice is a friendly tour guide. Most of the sites are reviewed or at least put into some kind of context. I guess my only problem is I just don't understand why Fashion & Beauty is a women's issue.<br>- Victoria Shannon<br>???<br>THERE are few gentler ways to idle away the hours than to become engrossed in cricket.<br>An Ashes-related Web site allows users with Java-enabled browsers to select teams and play matches over four innings.<br>I had a fine weekend. My Australian selection beat England outright by 177 runs, partly due to a mesmerising four-wicket spell by Shane Warne.<br>But the telling factor was a century in each innings by Mark Taylor. Sometimes miracles do happen ... even if only in the virtual world.<br>URLs<br>Communicator (Australian sites) - www.netscape.com.au or werple.net.au/-lions/software.htm<br>Netcaster FAQ - www.netscape.com.au/flash1/comprod/products/communicator/netcast<br>Cricket game - www-aus.cricket.org:8000/link-to-database/INTERACTIVE/GAMES/Sim1/MultiTeam/<br></font></p>
