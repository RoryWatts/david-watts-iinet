            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A game that will put AFL football fervour in the shade for a month . . . I'd like to see that.<br>Well it is about to go on show in every corner of the world, not to mention hundreds of sites on the World Wide Web. The soccer World Cup, or France98, begins tomorrow with matches in Montpellier (Morocco v Norway) and Saint-Denis (Brazil v Scotland). The supreme competition between 32 finalists runs until July 10.<br>On the Web one of the best places to catch the cup action is the official France98 site. This nicely designed site is augmented by Macromedia Flash technology which animates many of its sections beautifully.<br>The designers have followed the KISS (keep it simple stupid) maxim and used Flash to make sections easier to follow rather than to show off the technology itself. Thus to find which matches are on any day of the week, it is a simple matter of clicking on the date for full details. From there it is easy to check out the venues with plenty of information about not only the stadiums, but the history and geography of host cities like Paris, Nantes and Montpellier as well.<br>There is plenty of up-to-the-minute news and comprehensive profiles of all competing teams.<br>English fans might prefer Soccernet which is produced with the help of the soccer-centric Daily Mail newspaper and provides its news and views from a mainly Anglo viewpoint.<br>It also has several online polls, one of which allows you to rank the countries the way you see them finishing, and a chat line.<br>Also from England The Guardian takes a slightly wider view of the cup from its quality broadsheet position, but in the end concentrates on the prospects of England and Scotland.<br>The Internet Soccer Fans Association broadens out to cover all contestants and points surfers in the direction of relevant newsgroups and chat sessions which talk about nothing but soccer.<br>The ISFA site also provides fans with polls about topical issues such as which country they think should have made the finals.<br>No country is left out at Ozsoccer which, strictly speaking, is not a World Cup site. But it is an Australian compilation of links to every soccer country imaginable, and if you can't find cup coverage among its hundreds of links, you are not trying.<br>All important to armchair fans is the TV coverage which will be responsible for many a late night. SBS is handling that and has a site devoted to details of its cup programming.<br>After reading it you will know why the network is sometimes called Soccer Bloody Soccer.<br></font></p>
