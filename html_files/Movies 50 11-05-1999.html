            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">RADIO<br>BRS Radio Directory<br>www.radio-directory.fm<br>AT the weekend I sat listening to stirring classical music being pumped through my PC's speakers by the RealPlayer live audio program.<br>The music came from a station called Radio Beethoven in Santiago, Chile. It was clear and uninterrupted.<br>Radio Beethoven is only one of 2200 sites which allow users to tune into live radio broadcasts from anywhere in the world.<br>The BRS site lists all these stations neatly by country. Under Australia it has 29 stations including 96fm and RTR-FM in Perth.<br>BRS also has links to radio stations with Web sites but no live broadcasts. There are more than 70 in Australia, and a random search reveals some great sites.<br>One is Sonshine FM, the Christian radio station in Perth, which has used some exciting Flash technology to highlight its Solid Rock pages.<br>Sonshine FM's Solid Rock pages are at:<br>solidrock.sonshine.com.au/main.html.<br>FILM<br>Cannes Film Festival<br>www.festival-cannes.org<br>THE Cannes Film Festival is sure to produce plenty of controversies as well as a list of must-see films.<br>This official site will keep film buffs up to date and provide video clips of important moments as well as scenes from the top nominations.<br>But the treasure is to be found in the archives. Here, dedicated lovers of film can troll through 51 years of winners and nominations to find brief summaries of all the great and not-so-great festival entries.<br>SPORT<br>Surfing Australia<br>www.surfingaustralia.com.au<br>PROFESSIONAL surfing is a big sport in Australia and to match its impact the Surfing Australia site aims to provide an informative and newsy resource for the sport's devotees. The site has exhaustive lists of contests with all competitors at all stages, from prelimaries through to finals.<br>ABORIGINAL CULTURE<br>Stories of the Dreaming<br>www.dreamtime.net.au<br>YOU will need RealPlayer to make the most of Stories of the Dreaming - a collaboration between Australia's Cultural Network (through the Federal Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) and the Australian Museum.<br>The stories come from Australia's Aboriginal cultures and have been collected from across the country. Some are in straight text format while others are in audio.<br>A few storytellers use words from their own languages and direct translations are provided where possible.<br></font></p>
