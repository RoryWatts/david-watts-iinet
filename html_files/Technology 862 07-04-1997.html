            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Australian Democrats have thrown their political weight behind Australia's one million Internet users in the fight against the Federal Government's introduction of timed local business data calls.<br>Opponents of timed local data calls say they would cause the death of the Internet. Hundreds of small businesses would be forced to close and Net access would become too expensive for average householders.<br>Senator Lyn Allison promised at the weekend to introduce a private member's Bill that would stop Telstra charging recipients of fax and modem calls.<br>The promise follows a vow on Thursday by Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja to present to the Senate an electronic petition against timed charges.<br>The petition, which had more than 16,000 names yesterday, has been on the World Wide Web of the Net since March 27. There were early fears it would be invalid because it did not have handwritten signatures.<br>But Senator Stott Despoja, the party's technology spokeswoman, said Clerk of the Senate Harry Evans had given the all-clear for electronic petitions.<br>She hailed the move as a great day for the Senate.<br>?It acknowledges that electronic documents, such as petitions, are valid additions to the community's involvement in the parliamentary process,? she said.<br>Senator Allison, the party's telecommunications spokeswoman, said on Saturday night she wanted to guarantee that local business calls by fax or modem would not be charged to the recipient.<br>B-party charging has been seen as the likely way to time-charge businesses. Telstra spokesmen have acknowledged it will be an option after Telstra is part-privatised on July 1.<br>A B-party call would charge an Internet service provider for the time spent on-line by a customer using a modem to access the Net. A typical Net call like this lasts about an hour.<br>The Australian Internet Association, representing more than 100 service providers, said providers would be forced to pass these costs back to customers, or close.<br>Telstra's Net services, generally more expensive, then would become the option for a much dearer service.<br>Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston has said he will not allow Telstra to charge in this way.<br>But Senator Allison said Senator Alston had made no legislative move to guarantee this.<br>?The Internet should be available to everyone. It should not be allowed to become the preserve of the rich,? Senator Allison said.<br>The Senate approved timed local business data calls, after July 1, two days before the Easter break.<br>The debate, overshadowed by the euthanasia vote, centred on claims by Telstra that increased use of the Net would clog the phone network.<br>Senator Alston said businesses were in a position to pay.<br></font></p>
