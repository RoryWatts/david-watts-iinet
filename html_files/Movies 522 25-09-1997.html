            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BUDDY<br>Based on Animals Are My Hobby, the autobiography of eccentric New York socialite Gertrude ?Trudy? Lintz, Buddy is the story of one woman's passion for animals and her quest to raise a baby gorilla. Instead of enjoying the roaring 20s, Trudy Lintz (an elegant Rene Russo) risked social ridicule by surrounding herself with a menagerie of champion dogs, a troupe of cheeky chimps, and Buddy, the hand-raised gorilla who soon grew into a handful that no lock or chain could contain. At around 85 minutes, there's not enough time to delve into much character development or background, but Buddy certainly seemed to keep last weekend's predominantly under-10 preview audience entranced. Although the animatronic gorilla is sometimes a bit unbelievable for we older folk, parents should get a few laughs from Robbie ?Cracker? Coltrane as Trudy's long suffering physician husband Bill, who jokes the only reason she is keeping the gorilla is so she has someone to wear his sizable hand-me- downs. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>DOING TIME FOR PATSY CLINE<br>Australian writer-director Chris Kennedy goes country and western in this quirkily different tale about a young man's wish fulfilment on the road to Nashville. Engaging performances from Miranda Otto, Richard Roxburgh and Matt Day enliven what is already a vibrant combination of fantasy, romantic comedy, road movie and prison drama. The elements fuse together rather neatly as the trio cross the Australian countryside, only to land in prison where the men must share the cells with a trio of musically limited desperadoes. Our young hero Ralph (Matt Day) finally gets to realise his dreams - Nashville and the girl (Otto) - at least in his own mind. At the Luna. For a full review see Arts Today page 5. Rated M<br>(Ron Banks)<br>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING<br>What do you do when your best friend, who just happens to be the man of your dreams, announces that in four days time, he is going to marry another woman, and she wants you to be the maid of honour? Try desperately yet covertly to break them up, of course! After a string of big budget flops and near misses, it is a relief to finally see Julia Roberts back on track in this warm, witty and hugely endearing tale of love and friendship and what happens when the two get mixed up. Julianne (Roberts) and Michael (Dermot Mulroney) made a pact to marry on their 28th birthdays if they didn't have a significant other. With the big 28 on the horizon and an urgent message from Michael, Julianne thinks he's calling to pop the big one. Naturally she is shattered to find he has already done that - to the beautiful, blonde and horribly rich Kimmy (Cameron Diaz). Roberts literally bumbles her way through the film, falling off beds, splitting seams and cooking up crazy, mean and downright stupid ideas in a last-ditch attempt to win back Michael (a sadly uncharismatic Mulroney). But she has a brilliant co-conspirator in her gay English editor George, played with panache by Rupert Everett, to whom Aussie director PJ Hogan (Muriel's Wedding) has assigned some of the best one-liners of the film. Very silly at times, but a treat to watch just the same. Rated M (Sue Yeap).<br>PAWS<br>Teenage blues guitarist Nathan Cavaleri, whose last foray on to the big screen was in the Disney film Camp Nowhere, does a plausible job in this far fetched story of an incredibly smart dog who manages to toy with a computer's voice emulation software so he too can ?speak.? PC the Jack Russell is a dog with a mission after his owner Alex is surreptitiously disposed of in the opening scenes. After yet another accident, PC ends up with Zac Feldman (Cavaleri), a teen with step-father and girl problems. Pretty soon these unusual pals are using their computer skills and savvy to outwit the baddies and find a hidden bounty. PC is without a doubt the star of the show, due to having the best lines and the very distinct and often funny voice of Billy Connolly. Younger children might find the slightly morbid opening and the villainous Anya (Sandy Gore) a bit on the creepy side, but there's plenty of feelgood family mush in there to balance it out. The occasional but well placed use of computer graphics gives this Australian-made film a 90s edge. Rated PG<br>(Sue Yeap)<br>A SIMPLE WISH<br>The idea of a failed male fairy godmother named Murray trying and mostly mucking up attempts to grant a young girl her wish that her dad get the leading role in a Broadway musical is a good one. But it needs more than just loopy facial expressions from Murray (played by Martin Short), or bolshy cuteness from Anabel (Mara Wilson of Mrs Doubtfire fame) to make it work. What it really needs is a cohesive narrative rather than this scattergun approach where actors and plot sometimes meet, but mostly go their own sweet way. Parts of this are handled very well with good laughs and site gags like the 16-metre rabbi, the egocentric Broadway star coughing up frogs during an audition and the lovely little performance by Amanda Plummer as a dog called Boots turned into Claudia's human companion. But much of it just does not make sense. The in-jokes about Broadway musicals will be beyond many children and special effects like Murray turning into putty appear to be included simply because they can be done. For a film about magic A Simple Wish lacks too much of it. Rated G (David Watts)<br>SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL<br>Jan De Bont virtually redefined the action movie with his devilishly wicked surprise hit about a booby trapped bus set to explode if it dropped below a certain speed. By chopping out anything that smelled like story, theme or character development De Bont created thrill-a-second entertainment for the computer-game generation. Unfortunately, trying to recapture the edge-of-the-seat thrills of Speed by setting it on a cruise ship in the Caribbean was not such a bright idea. First, it has to spend too much time convincing us that nobody can get off the boat; second, the scheming of the crazed hijacker (played by Willem Dafoe) is pushed beyond the limits of believability; and third, we don't get to see the boat jump over a broken bridge. And while De Bont was fortunate enough to get the charmingly natural Sandra Bullock for return ride (unlike her fellow Speed passenger Keanu Reeves) she's cut adrift far too early with the rather wooden Jason Patric taking the wheel. But, hey, for $11.50 where else are you going to see a cruise ship crash into an island and split a town in two? Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>ULEE'S GOLD<br>There's something truly eerie about seeing Peter Fonda cast as the patriarch of a family being torn apart by drug problems. Here we have one of the key symbols of the 60s, the generation which was responsible for introducing casual drug taking into mainstream American life, playing a character trying to pull his wretched, strung-out daughter-in-law from the clutches of low-life, drug-dealing scumbags. I'm not sure how conscious was the casting of Fonda as Ulee Jackson, a Vietnam veteran who has found emotional refuge in the gentle rhythms of beekeeping, but it's mightily effective. It adds depth and poignancy to this moving, beautifully understated story about redemption and the resilience of the family. Some will find Ulee's Gold a little too slow; however, writer-director Victor Nunez, one of the veterans of the American independent cinema (Gal Young "Un, Ruby in Paradise), gets such honest and believable performances from his cast that you flinch from recognition. Even better are the echoes of On Golden Pond, with the former Easy Rider Fonda looking unmistakably like his own father. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M<br>(Mark Naglazas)<br>WILD AMERICA<br>Wild America is a delightfully far-fetched family adventure inspired by the real-life exploits of three teenage Arkansas brothers during the summer of 1967. Credibility is stretched at every turn but that adds rather than detracts from the fun because, even if everything didn't quite happen in real life as this movie depicts it, it should have. The three boys (Scott Bairstow, Devon Sawa and Jonathan Taylor Thomas) set out on a summer odyssey, driving around the country in an old truck carrying an even older 16mm camera, with which Marty hopes to shoot enough exotic wildlife footage to end up with a documentary to sell to television. The boys plunge swiftly into more perils than Pauline but the extreme danger of most of them is deflected with much humour. In reality, the boys' parents would have been out of their minds to let their young sons go off on such a quest since they're clearly not remotely responsible, experienced or old enough to undertake it. But this is an escapist movie with a lot of comedy in which the boys are armed with infallible pluck and luck. Rated PG (Kevin Thomas - LA Times)<br>FREE WILLY 3: The Rescue<br>This latest adventure about a killer whale named Willy is sparked by its two young stars but it is otherwise dull and tedious. This time round Jesse (again played by Jason James Richter) has a summer job tracking the declining whale population aboard a research vessel with his mentor Randolph (August Schellenberg, also reprising). Meanwhile, 10-year-old Max (Vincent Berry) is going to sea for the first time with his father, John, captain of a salmon fishing boat. John's key source of income is from the illegal slaughter of whales for sale to countries where whale meat is considered a delicacy. So who should turn up but Willy and his new mate? In his film debut, Berry is most impressive as a youngster torn between his love for his father and horror at his discovery of the illegal whaling. Richter is likewise effective as a youth on the edge of adulthood struggling to be taken seriously by his elders and trying to persuade Max to help save Willy. But Sam Pillsbury's direction is so earnest he allows for no humour along the way and little suspense. Also, the film's climactic sequence is unintentionally unsettling. While preservation of the orca whales and obeying the law are of paramount importance, Free Willy 3 actually suggests that seriously endangering John's life is less important than saving the life of a whale. Would little Max really rather see his father die than Willy? You're left to wonder. Rated PG (Kevin Thomas - LA Times)<br></font></p>
