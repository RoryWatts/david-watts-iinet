            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHEN Nino Culotta, aka John O'Grady, wrote They're a Weird Mob in the early 1960s he was talking about Australians.<br>Since then we have been exposed to enough American media to know that he was wrong.<br>The Yanks are the weird mob. On the Web, an antiques bookstore in Lake Placid, Florida, trumpets that it has a copy of They're a Weird Mob for $US10, describing the work as ?One of the funniest books about Australians ever written?.<br>Well, how funny are we compared with the bookseller's native countrymen who now show cosmetic surgery live on the Web?<br>And, as a bonus, they allow liposuction-seeking citizens to e-mail them for the chance of a free operation.<br>It's all true folks and playing on a computer screen near you at the Online Surgery site.<br>Surfers interested in ?experiencing the difference cosmetic surgery will make? to their lives are encouraged to fill out an eligibility application and to part with a $US5 processing fee. They are then asked to choose an operation. The options are face lift, breast augmentation, liposuction or nasal surgery.<br>Online Surgery's most recent live Webcast was last Wednesday when it showed a breast lift with implants. It also featured a post-operation interview about a stomach tuck.<br>If you cannot get to a screen for a live show, Online Surgery has a video archive of operations, among which are a nose job and a tummy tuck.<br>The site's creators, based in Seattle, claim they will broaden their horizons shortly, moving into showing births and orthopaedic procedures.<br>If that is too blood-curdling, then try the simply mind-numbing, as promised by the guardians of an alien abduction site called: If they won't contact you, you contact us.<br>The premise here is that if you haven't been abducted by an alien yet, you might be doing something wrong. This site tries to find out why and how you might become better prey for aliens . . . best not to ask why.<br>Consider this on-site spiel: ?Most people will probably never have the opportunity to be abducted by aliens. And even those elite few who are selected for abduction receive no assurances that they will fully remember their experience.<br>?So why wait? Why wonder if they're ever going to come for you? Why even invest the time, trouble, and expense involved in an actual abduction when the highly trained and professional staff at Alien Abductions Incorporated can provide you with personalised, realistic memories of the alien abduction that you have been waiting for your entire life??<br>With an introduction like that, the next step - a questionnaire designed to help you become alien bait - is hard to resist.<br>Here are a few of the 24 questions asked at the Abductalizer page (where a personal abduction analysis factor is calculated):Of how many popular songs do you remember all the lyrics? None / 1 / 2-5 / 6-8 / 9+<br>Is your favourite colour blue? (If you have no favourite colour, would you choose blue if required to select a favourite colour?)<br>Are there any birds in your current field of vision?<br>How many house plants are there in your primary place of residence? (Include succulents, do not include cacti.)Did you vote for Ross Perot? Yes / No / Twice.<br>Need I go on? This is pretty weird stuff, and it is the tip of an iceberg that keeps getting bigger.<br></font></p>
