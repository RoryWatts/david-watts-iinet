            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET observers at the US organisation, cnet, estimate there are more than 100 million pages of information on the World Wide Web.<br>Given that the Georgia Institute of Technology recently found the average Web surfer spends about six hours a week browsing pages, there seems little chance anyone has come close to reading even 5 per cent of the available material.<br>And with the amount of sheer unadulterated dross and rubbish out there, it's certain no one would want to.<br>A solid starting point is needed to find good pages. Web search engines such as Yahoo and Lycos offer a word or key phrase to find interesting sites.<br>However, the results can be hit or miss, sometimes amusing, often frustrating. Happily there are other ways to get the best out of the Web.<br>The growth of best-of pages is mushrooming nearly as much as the Web itself. Many surfers have been on the Web long enough now to compile lists of their favourite sites for others to go to.<br>But safe, sure bets are search engines' lists of frequently accessed sites. Let's face it, if 3500 people a week are visiting the Internet Movie Data Base and no one is visiting the Max Bygraves home page, you have a reasonable expectation that one site is better than the other.<br>Professional Web navigators such as GNN, cnet or AAA Announce also give good pointers to what is good, although with both search engines and navigators you sometimes find lists submitted by others. And that can open up ridiculous rather than sublime sites.<br>As a matter of fact, one of the better best-of sites around is called From the Ridiculous to the Sublime, put up by the people at lookup.com.<br>Their humorously presented home page has a picture of late US president Richard Nixon shaking hands with Elvis Presley - that stands for the ridiculous sites.<br>The symbol for sublime is the Three Stooges. For the ridiculous site of the week you click on an image of Mr T.<br>Last week's ridiculous site was a home page by a US woman called Amy asking whether she should leave the toilet door open when she goes there. Her boyfriend thought no and Amy is asking the Internet community to help her in the dilemma.<br>She has provided a form for surfers to give their views via e-mail.<br>The sublime site is accessed by clicking on an image of Groucho Marx. Last week it was the wonderfully apt Centre for the Easily Amused, a Vancouver, Canada, site with great links for the ... easily amused.<br>Past sublime sites include the Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook and the Fidel Castro for President page, the Ultimate Washington Outsider.<br>Search engines Lycos and Webcrawler give excellent best-of lists with Lycos splitting 250 sites into 10 categories.<br>Webcrawler, which is the most hit-and-miss searcher, takes the time to list the top 25 sites by access but the most accessed site recently by Webcrawler searchers was the Yahoo search engine. Webcrawler itself came third.<br>GNN has a branch office called the Whole Internet Catalogue which lists 50 top sites according to accesses.<br>Number one was the zine (electronic magazine) Urban Desires, followed by Regarding Sex, a site where browsers can ask questions and/or view answers by a sexual health expert.<br>Also scoring highly were Yahoo, geekgirl and the Web Voyeur, which is not what it sounds but collections of real-time video images from around the world.<br>If there are any conclusions from looking at best-of sites it is that Yahoo is mentioned in most.<br>?What's your favourite site? WestWeb is doing a crude survey to ascertain the 10 most favoured sites of readers. E-mail watto@iinet.net.au with one site URL and one sentence saying why.<br></font></p>
