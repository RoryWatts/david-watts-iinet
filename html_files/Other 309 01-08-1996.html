            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPIKE MILLIGAN once wrote: ?The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had parted ... twit.?<br>I feel a lot like that after turning off the television yesterday morning and missing Australia's thrilling fightback and victory over Croatia in the men's basketball.<br>But it had to be done. Very early yesterday I found myself gazing fixedly at mountain bike riding. Many other people told me they did the same thing.<br>It is a sure sign of addiction to the power of the Games that people all over the State are staying up to watch sport of this sort.<br>I turned the armchair towards the computer to find out the real winners of Atlanta 96 so far.<br>The medals table is a basic indication of comparative sporting prowess but it leaves out a lot of variables that can be used to prove points in pub arguments.<br>How should the countries be ranked? Basic medal wins do not take into account the size of the team, the money spent on sport by each country or the relative wealth of a country (GDP).<br>All those could be factored in to make a wonderfully long mathematical equation that would show either Syria, Armenia or Trinidad as the best performer.<br>But you could also rank countries by average height, or weight or age with a weighting formula designed to favour the vertically challenged.<br>You could do whatever you wanted - but I prefer the simple per-head-of-population formula.<br>For modesty's sake let's call it the Watto-meter. Here's how it works:<br>A gold is worth three points, a silver two and a bronze one. Add each country's tally then divide by the number of million people living there.<br>For example Britain, having a truly wretched time of it, has one gold, three silver and five bronze to show its 58 million narked people. The gold scores three, the silvers six and the bronzes five. That makes a total of 14 which is then divided by 58 for a Watto-meter rating of 0.24.<br>If you think all this is designed to show that Australia is the greatest sporting nation on Earth; well, it was.<br>But it didn't work. We did slightly better than in traditional tables, whether ranked by gold (seventh) or total medals (fifth).<br>THE winner so far is Costa Rica, which has won one gold swimming medal but has a population of only 300,000, making a score of 10.00.<br>Then follows New Zealand on 4.00 and Australia on 3.17, Ireland 2.86, Hungary 2.40 and Cuba 2.36.<br>Every powerhouse listed above Australia in traditional tables struggles under the rigours of the Watto-meter.<br>The US scores only 0.55, Russia 0.63, France a not-too-bad 1.12, China a truly flabbergasting 0.06, Italy 0.95 and Germany 0.90.<br>Minnow Jamaica does well with 2.00. Greece has 1.80, Switzerland 1.57, Belarus 1.50, Finland 1.40, and Namibia and the Netherlands 1.33.<br>PS: I did see Drew Morphett and Steve Foley spitting the dummy at the diving because the computers were falling down on their job.<br>Foley should remember the days when the judges gave their marks by holding up pieces of cardboard with their scores - much as they do on Red Faces.<br></font></p>
