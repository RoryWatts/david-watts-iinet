            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT<br>Rugby World Cup<br>www.rwc99.com/home/default.sps<br>Soccer - Perth Glory<br>www.perthglory.com.au<br>Cricket - Western Warriors<br>www.westernwarriors.com.au<br>Basketball - Perth Wildcats<br>www.wildcats.com.au<br>IF YOU thought the AFL grand final signalled the end of the good life for couch potatoes, think again.<br>The Rugby World Cup starts in Britain at the weekend and has a big presence on the Web, echoing the global interest in a code of football romantically known as the game they play in heaven. Add in the fact that Australia's Wallabies have a strong chance and the official World Cup site might become as required surfing as was the official AFL site during the football season.<br>Highlights include an impressive range of updated news reports, pictures and histories of the famous venues, such as Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms Park, and links to player profiles for the 20 teams.<br>It's not the soccer World Cup nor the Olympics, but it's not a bad sporting diversion.<br>Domestically, the summer months will be dominated by the Glory in soccer, Warriors in cricket and Wildcats in basketball.<br>All three have impressively simple sites which are fast, easily navigated and full of information on coming matches, players and how to buy tickets.<br>MUSIC<br>Yahoo Australian and NZ Music<br>music.yahoo.com.au<br>WEB giant Yahoo is not satisfied with supplying the must-have search index of the medium. It is growing branches everywhere. The latest addition from the Australasian arm of Yahoo is this comprehensive music site.<br>The site features local music news, reviews, tours, charts and profiles, gathered from a diverse range of content providers.<br>?We've teamed up with some great Australian music sites to make Yahoo Music really relevant for Australian users,? senior producer of Yahoo Australia Alan Jones said recently. ?With Yahoo Music we aim to deliver a site that fulfils most popular music fans' needs, with an emphasis on local bands and local music news.?<br>TELEVISION<br>Neighbours.com<br>www.neighbours.com/home.htm<br>WHAT made the earth move - was it when Scott met Charlene, Annalise's ?wedding? or Joel's rescue? If that sounds like gobbledygook, you are obviously not a fan of the long-running Australian soap opera, Neighbours.<br>This official site is built for fans and relies on fan feedback for a lot of its content. The so-called magical moments are all available to be viewed as video clips. Fans can then vote online for their favourite.<br>The Neighbours site summarises episodes screening both in Australia and the UK, which has a huge fan base.<br>The site's creators are looking for even more fan input and have appealed for feedback in the form of ideas, news, graphics, or anything that might belong on the site.<br></font></p>
