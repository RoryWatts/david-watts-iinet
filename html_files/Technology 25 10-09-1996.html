            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ABOUT 100 million pages of information are floating around in cyberspace. Most have been created using hyper text markup language or HTML.<br>HTML is the language of the 1990s. It allows a computer user to design and publish on the World Wide Web. HTML documents can be straight text or a rich mixture of animated graphics, sounds and Java programs.<br>The only limitation on content appears to be the user's imagination.<br>Keeping pace with the exponential growth of Net users in the past year has been the acceleration of HTML editors - programs which allow users to create pages for the Web.<br>It is possible to write HTML with a simple text editor like Windows Notepad. Some users have even done it with Edlin in DOS.<br>But that appears to be the preserve of the confident and experienced. Even though HTML is not a difficult language to learn, and is quite logical the more it is used, it is nevertheless a little daunting for the new and inexperienced user who wants to join the throng of so-called ?vanity publishers? on the Web.<br>In the past six months WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) editors have been produced to make HTML as simple as pointing and clicking. The coding is done in the background. Even tables and forms can be produced by following simple prompts.<br>The programs that have helped revolutionise HTML are Microsoft Front Page, for PC platforms, and Adobe Page Mill for the Macintosh.<br>They offer users a quick and mostly painless introduction to Web publishing at a moderate price, though the coding on actual documents, with Front Page at least, is messier than that produced by more labour-intensive programs.<br>Netscape makes the ultimate Web tool with its Navigator Gold browser, which not only allows Web browsing and news and mail, but also WYSIWIG HTML production.<br>Fortunately the Web has several informative sites dealing specifically with HTML editors. Not only do these sites explain the features of the programs, they offer reviews and the ability to download as well.<br>On the MS-Windows side, there are few better starting points than Carl Davis's HTML Editor Reviews pages. Mr Davis has tried dozens of editors over the past two years and is considering extending his tests to cover Macintosh as well.<br>He compares editors by testing them on a DX2/66 with 8Mb of RAM, and assesses stability, speed, ease of operation and how the user interacts with the editor.<br>The programs that have scored top marks are MS Front Page, HotDog, HoTMetaL Pro, HTMLed PRO, GNNPress/NaviPress and Ken Nesbitt's WebEdit.<br>HotDog is actually the most praised conventional HTML editor on the Web. It wins a ?Get It? recommendation at the popular Windows95 shareware site, windows95.com; and is the top rated editor at The Consummate Winsock Apps List.<br>Winners of ?Get It? tags at windows95.com are CMed, HTML Blankie, HTMLpad, MS Front Page, HomeSite (which is free), DerekWare HTML Author (free), Claris Homepage (free in beta version), Internet Editor, WebEdit Pro, WebThing, Web Media Publisher Pro, WebEdit Standard, TC Director and ReVOL WebWorker.<br>URLs:<br>Carl Davis's HTML Editor Reviews:<br>www.techsmith.com/community/htmlrev/index.htm<br>Macintosh HTML Editors:<br>sdg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/mag/work/HTMLEditors/maclist.htm<br>Wind shareware: www.windows95.com<br>Consummate Winsock Apps: cwsapps.tower.com.au/html.html<br>HotDog: www.sausage.com.au<br></font></p>
