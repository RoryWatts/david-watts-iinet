            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIA'S Olympic team left the record book in tatters. The 41 medals only scratches the surface of a strong overall performance.<br>The Australian Sports Commission has used the Internet over the Games fortnight to keep sports enthusiasts right up to date.<br>After each day the commission posted the result of every event contested by an Australian, the medal tally and the comparative positions to previous Games in Barcelona and Seoul.<br>This information included not only the number of golds, silvers and bronzes, but also the number of top eight and top 16 placings won by our athletes.<br>In Atlanta Australians were in the top eight 93 times and the top 16 152 times. This compares with 66 top eight and 119 top 16 places at Barcelona where we won 27 medals, and 58 top eights and 89 top 16s in Seoul where we won 14 medals.<br>Thirty swimmers placed in the top 16 in Atlanta, 24 of the track and field team, 15 cyclists and 13 rowers.<br>In the overall medal count, Australia, with nine, was the seventh most successful country ranked by gold. The US juggernaut rolled home easily with 44 gold, 32 silver and 25 bronze.<br>In total medals won, Australia's 41 placed it fifth after the US (101), Germany (65), Russia (63) and China (50). France with 37 and Italy (35) followed.<br>On the Internet it was possible to rank countries by several less traditional means. The Yahoo site in the US showed that Australia was third in total bronze medals. Germany had 27 and the US 25 to our 23.<br>And Algeria was still the number one country by alphabetical order, ahead of Argentina and Armenia. Australia was fourth.<br>On a population basis, and giving 3 for gold, 2 for silver and 1 for bronze, the tiny island kingdom of Tonga, which has 98,000 people and won a boxing silver medal, rated as the Games winner.<br>Bahamas and Jamaica, which showed that small states can win big prizes, easily beat New Zealand, Cuba, Hungary, then Australia.<br>Whatever way you look at it Australia was in the top 10.<br></font></p>
