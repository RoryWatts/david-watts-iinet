            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT'S amazing how life teaches us little lessons all the time. In recent weeks I've been taught a couple of things that will stick with me all my days. The first is never to trim your beard in the dark. Then there is the invaluable one of not drinking two cups of coffee immediately before a 90-minute session of relaxation therapy in which you are expected to lie semi-comatose and be full of only happy thoughts.<br>Such lessons take many forms. Recently an engineer friend sent me a nerdy memo that I'm told is about seven years old. Well it's new to me and it opened my eyes with understanding. Called the New Electrical Theory it starts like this: ?Electrical circuits work by the transmission of electrical current and the retention of what is commonly known as "smoke'. Smoke is the thing that makes electrical circuits work. The new theory has been proved by the fact that whenever something happens that lets the smoke leak out of the circuit, it stops working.?<br>Bearing this educational enthusiasm in mind, I wonder what we can learn from the two biggest events in the world tomorrow; the republic referendum and the Australia-France rugby union World Cup final (well, they're the biggest in my one-eyed view at least).<br>The Australians will murder the French, of course. Our gallant Burkes and Horans and Kefus will be too much for a bunch of Gauloise-smoking, snail-eating, garlic-munching pretenders who speak like Inspector Clouseau.<br>But ignoring such objectivity, I have to admit to a deal of admiration for the French. Yes I know about nuclear testing and the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior and that lone yachtswoman who Aussie taxpayers have had to fish out of the drink.<br>But when they sing La Marseillaise, it is tempting to barrack for them and to become an honorary Frenchperson. Such a song, full of passion and flair, makes a bit of a joke of our own, especially the line ?our home is girt by sea?. I thought I detected Kate Ceberano stifling a little giggle when she sang this bit before the Melbourne Cup.<br>Channel 10 brought us those scenes and I think host Tim Webster described Ms Ceberano's rendition as absolutely wonderful. It would be a surprise if he didn't because everything else - and I only watched for 40 minutes - was painted with the absolute brush.<br>The atmosphere was absolutely electric, Bart Cummings was an absolute genius, Rogan Josh was absolutely brilliant, John Marshall was absolutely ecstatic.<br>Absolutely . . . but I've wandered off the thread here. Oh yes, the French. They have great food and wine, the most beautiful capital city, Paris, and more art and culture than you can poke a stick at. They gave the world Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, almost enough said.<br>But, of course, they're a republic too, one of the most famous of all and into its fifth version since the locals held slightly more passionate referenda than we'll see, back in the late 18th century.<br>Tomorrow night when they try to beat us, we could be a republic too, albeit one arrived at by calling each other clowns and verbally kicking one another in the teeth.<br>Then again we could still be a constitutional monarchy. This would go against the grain of our skipper John Eales who is on record as saying he would have liked to play England on November 6 so Australia could thrash the Poms and get rid of their Queen in one move.<br>If we are still a constitutional monarchy then we have good reason to fear the French. They dethroned New Zealand, the kings of world rugby, a week ago, which is not all that surprising given that they chopped off the head of their own monarchs in 1792.<br>So can we learn anything from all this?<br>Yes and No.<br></font></p>
