            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAS been a fruitful time for Internet users who like to keep their software up-to-date.<br>A quick glance at the TUCOWS (The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software) and Black Stump program repositories reveals some updates that fall into the must-have category of Net tools.<br>?WinZip 7.0 beta 3: The latest version of the compression utility has an easier and more colourful user interface that adds to its reputation for reliability and user-friendliness.<br>? CuteFTP 2.5: The popular FTP (file transfer protocol) utility is a must for Web publishers. It has jazzed up its looks slightly and added new sites to its connection facility. CuteFTP is facing increasing competition from the likes of FTP Voyager which also has a new release available.<br>? Communicator 4.06: Netscape has a beta of its version 4.5 browser suite out and about for appraisal. But the 4.06 release is meant as the real upgrade for full-time, less buggy use.<br>? Eudora Lite 3.06: The free version of Qualcomm's popular quality e-mail tool gets a revamp.<br>? HotDog Pro Suite 5.1 and HotDog Express 1.52: Sausage software has had to work hard in the crowded HTML editor market. The 5.1 is aimed at novice Web authors.<br>? Arachnophilia 3.5 Build 3812: One of the HTML editors HotDog has to fight.<br>It has won five stars - the highest rating - from the critics at TUCOWS.<br>? WinRescue 95 and WinRescue 98: Both have won five stars from TUCOWS.<br>These packages are designed as quick, easy ways to back up critical Windows system files.<br>HELP DESK<br>TUCOWS:<br>tucows.iinet.net.au/<br>Black Stump software:<br>werple.net.au/lions/<br>software.htm<br></font></p>
