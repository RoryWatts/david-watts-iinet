            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HOMER SIMPSON receives the dubious achievement award - again - for this line in The Simpsons on Channel 10 last week: ?Wow, they've got the Internet on computers now.?<br>As we know, Homer is not a bright bloke, but perhaps he would be more amazed to know that ?they? even have live birth on the Internet now.<br>Last Tuesday America's Health Network allowed people with RealPlayer to watch a 40-year-old woman give birth to a girl named Elizabeth. The video footage is archived at the site for those who missed it, which turned out to be millions because of the line congestion.<br>At least 30,000 people, almost all from the eastern US, tried to log on within the first hour of broadcast but the system would accept only 3000 from the East at a time, said J. Tod Fetherling, president of America's Health Network-Interactive. The system was set up so about 10,000 people nationwide could watch at once.<br>Even America's Health Network's own technicians had trouble calling up the broadcast in a media room at the hospital.<br>For those who have seen a live birth, it remains a magical moment. For those who have not it is indeed a miracle. But birth on the screen is hardly something new.<br>Those who were around in 1968 might remember the first global TV satellite hook-up during which different countries contributed small segments of live action to be seen by the first truly mass audience.<br>Australia showed a tram leaving a depot in Melbourne. Mexico showed a live birth.<br>Sitting and watching -- particularly at a 28.8K RealPlayer broadcast that looks like stop-gap animation - is a passive activity even where a miraculous event like birth is concerned.<br>While baby Elizabeth's welcome to the world captured headlines last week, the real interactive nature of the Web bubbled along pretty much as always, satisfying millions in the process.<br>For example, those who were a little surprised or even shocked by the One Nation Party's assault on the hearts and minds of Queenslanders at the State election were able to read all about Pauline Hanson's policies at the official One Nation page.<br>If they disagreed they could click on the Our Nation petition against ONP and whiz off a protest e-mail.<br>If still in doubt they could have checked talkback radio's Howard Sattler Archives to see the arguments for and against. While at it they could have participated at his Opinion page which allows you to vote on a topic of the day and as many times as you like.<br>Or, with a looming Federal election in mind, you could have seen Health Minister Michael Wooldridge make his debut on the Web with his campaign site, believed to be the first by an Australian minister of State.<br>If you veered away from politics, www.consult had a terrific survey to fill in. It comprises 78 questions about Net use habits and dwells heavily on online shopping and banking, which are obviously growing trends.<br>At the Telstra Surelink page you could see just how the Web might become the ideal shopping mall. Assured of secure transactions with credit cards you can browse and order goodies including books from Angus & Robertson, CDs, software, hardware, flowers and fashion.<br>You might even like to pay your phone bill.<br>And that amount of interactivity is only the tip of a huge iceberg that has the potential to sink the growth of couch potatoism.<br>PS: Thank you to the dozens of readers who have e-mailed about the closure of the Access liftout. This new location does not mean any less help or information, and we will endeavour to incorporate as many Help Desks and columns as possible into my Web site at www<br>iinet.net.au/~watto/access /access.html<br></font></p>
