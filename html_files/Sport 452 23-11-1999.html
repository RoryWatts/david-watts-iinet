            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ADAM GILCHRIST'S timing during his 149 not out yesterday was impeccable.<br>And that went double for the shot that brought Australia's winning run and the comical signalling to Shane Warne to make sure he grounded his bat.<br>At the exact moment Gilchrist was seen souveniring a stump on Channel 9, the opening credits were starting to roll for part one of Seven's midday movie, Gone With the Wind.<br>So if you wanted to ignore the beautiful day outside, it was possible to bathe in four hours of Test cricket drama, followed immediately by two hours of one of the greatest films made.<br>The cricket was better though. Let's face it, Gone With the Wind has had a lot of exposure during its 60 years and doesn't hold many surprises.<br>The Hobart Test, on the other hand, was bursting with surprises; the biggest of all was that Australia was able to score 369 to win on the last day.<br>It was a day so pregnant with tension that at first I couldn't watch Gilchrist and Justin Langer as they set about the seemingly impossible task of resurrecting Australia from 5-188.<br>Seated outside, all I could hear from the television was appeal after fruitless Pakistani appeal. He may be called Shoaib Akhtar but perhaps it should be spelt Actor, given the fast bowler's theatrics.<br>The support cast doesn't let obvious inside edges in to the pads or wildly swinging deliveries put them off the histrionics, either.<br>Maybe they should all be given a snickometer and a replay video, toys that delight Richie Benaud's crew, particularly Mark Taylor, and we on the armchair.<br>They give us the incredible wisdom of hindsight.<br>After being too much of a coward to watch, I gradually found the courage to edge towards the set. From 5-250 to Gilchrist's glorious winning shot, I could not take my eyes off it.<br>Ian Healy rightly called it the greatest Test partnership he had seen. Even Benaud, the master of understatement, dug out a book of superlatives.<br>Ian Chappell seemed to sense the unlikely Australian victory almost 100 runs ahead of time. He continually pointed out the body language and temper of the frazzled Pakistani bowling attack.<br>Fans ?watching? a live Internet broadcast and barracking by e-mail were delighted.<br>?That's got to be the most incredible thing I have ever seen on a cricket field,? said one.<br>?Gilchrist (has) brought excitement into the team. It's his enthusiasm that will bring the rest of the boys' spirits up to make them invincible against India,? said another of the hundreds who joined in.<br>Seven has the field to itself as far as drama goes today.<br>It will play part two of Gone With the Wind, during which Rhett Butler will utter the immortal words, ?Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn?.<br>He definitely wasn't talking about the cricket ... roll on Friday.<br></font></p>
