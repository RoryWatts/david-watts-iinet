            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If economics is often said to be an inexact science and the Internet an inexact medium, what happens when the two come together?<br>We had the chance to do just that last week when searching for information on the falling Australian dollar. A search for the words ?foreign exchange? at Yahoo: Business and Economy revealed more than 20 companies who will happily take orders to buy and sell foreign currencies over the Net.<br>Unfortunately, the first one visited listed the Australian dollar as trading at 63 cents. The site was last updated in mid May. With information like that, you could easily book a berth on the Titanic.<br>Happily - or maybe unhappily, depending on whether you are an importer or exporter - there is an abundance of Net information to guide surfers through the maze of the dollar malaise.<br>The Australian Stock Exchange is up to date with latest trends and forecasts as well as relevant market news. And the Reserve Bank of Australia provides all the latest releases on economic indicators and trends.<br>The Australian Treasury has the latest in Federal Government policy and responses to the dollar fall.<br>You have to register, but the service from Europe's foremost finance journal the Financial Times is free and comprehensive. It has special sections on Asia and currencies as well as covering every corner of the globe economically speaking.<br>The Wall Street Journal is as comprehensive and authoritative as the FT, but after a two-week trial you will have to fork out $US49, which translates to a lot more Australian money than it used to.<br>To find out just how much, you can use the excellent Universal Currency Converter that will change an Irish punt into a Turkish lira at the click of a mouse.<br>If you are worried about personal financial matters such as home loan interest rates or investment for superannuation, and how they might be affected by the dollar's fortunes, try the My Money site, which dovetails with a commercial TV show.<br>Some of the information is a bit long in the tooth, but most areas of concern are covered.<br>BankSmart offers links to all Australia's banks and you can browse through comparison charts of mortgage rates very easily. The major banks all have sites that offer variable information. Some have online banking facilities. But all will tell you how much interest and what sort of fees you face.<br>The decline in the dollar has been blamed on US speculators selling it off to make a quick profit. You can see what sort of advice is being offered at one of the better known American institutions with the Merrill Lynch Online site.<br>From here it was possible to follow links last week to RealAudio summaries by US analysts about our dollar and their perceptions of our economy. The relevant URL for this service, provided by CNBC, is in the Help Desk on this page.<br>This is the final edition of Access.<br>From next week, some of the consumer content of the liftout will be incorporated in an expanded Computers & Communications section, which appears in Business every Tuesday.<br>Contact David Utting on (08) 9482 3268 for information.<br>Archived collections of Access WebSights and selected columns will remain at www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/access/<br>access.html until site master David Watts tires of them.<br></font></p>
