            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Boxing Day Test against South Africa cannot come soon enough.<br>Not only will it bring much-needed real sport back to our TV screens, it will also give us the chance to watch Shane Warne bowl in proper cricket - and to see if he is really fat.<br>But who cares about that last one?<br>Warne was at the eye of a storm last week, because he walked from a press conference at the unveiling of a wax likeness of himself.<br>A TV reporter - who said in Melbourne's Age newspaper that he was about 20kg overweight himself - asked Warne if he preferred the slimmer wax version of himself.<br>What a brouhaha over a few kilos.<br>I trawled the Internet yesterday to try to find Warne's vital statistics.<br>An Unofficial Shane Warne Page, written by a fan, said he was 183cm and 85kg (6ft 1in and 13st 5lb).<br>He might be, but nowhere else could I check it.<br>The Australian Cricket Board does not deal in such weighty matters and the reason is obvious.<br>Height and weight do not matter in Test cricket.<br>Armchair sportsmen probably get kicks from cricket and golf because they are two sports where ?normal? people might think they could stride the stage without appearing ridiculous.<br>You can't think that about Australian football (it was interesting to note in my Internet search, that three Eagles - Guy McKenna, Brett Heady and Chad Morrison - were all about the same size as Warne).<br>You could not contemplate that in athletics, swimming, basketball or boxing (though that old bruiser George Foreman is a lump of lard ... but don't tell him).<br>The perfect physique for a cricketer belonged to Dennis Lillee.<br>It also belonged to Sir Donald Bradman, Ian Botham, Bruce Reid, Merv Hughes, Glenn McGrath, Warwick Armstrong ... the list of wildly varying bodies is endless.<br>Where Michael Bevan might be a pocket Hercules, he can't hold a spinning finger to his chubbier mate, Warne.<br>If Warne's too fat, are McGrath and Jason Gillespie too thin for the big time?<br>OK, so Warne is about 5kg heavier than he should be.<br>Is it affecting him? Does it stop our enjoyment of watching him tie a batsman in knots?<br>Does it stop his aggression, or his give-it-all-for-Australia attitude?<br>No. He is, in a word, great.<br>In three words he is great for cricket.<br>The Test in the MCG cauldron will be as much about his character, as his ability.<br>The public focus on his waist has unsettled him.<br>In the past, cricketers such as Hughes - a great mate of Warne's - and Botham, Mike Gatting and Greg Ritchie have all let trivial name-calling go through to the keeper.<br>Warne is so good and so important to cricket, he would be wise to do the same.<br></font></p>
