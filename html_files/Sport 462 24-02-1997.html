            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Sports of all Sports<br>SOCCER is the most popular sport in the world. The global governing body, FIFA, says it is played in 191 countries, 180 of which are FIFA members.<br>The practice of kicking a round object has been around for more than 3000 years, according to the best estimates. But the game as we know it did not get going until the 1840s when English public schools formulated rules for boys to play their kicking games.<br>The Football Association was formed in London in 1863 and the name Association Football attached itself to the game. This has been abbreviated to soccer ever since, though in many countries there is only one code of football and soccer is it.<br>Soccer's early days gave no hint that it would become so popular. The wealthy<br>young Britons who formed the FA had all attended exclusive schools, each fanatically proud of their own traditions and rules.<br>The FA - with its universally acceptable rules for one game only - initially provided a game overseen by gentlemen for young gentlemen.<br>From 1863 to 1872, Association Football was scarcely a success. Teams often ignored the new rules. Most serious clubs were for gentlemen only.<br>But introduction of the FA Cup and international matches saved the game from ignominy. Until the 1890s Rugby Union was the premier code, drawing vast crowds in the north of England.<br>The surge of interest created by weekly cup competition and the advent of inexpensive, mass produced equipment quickly spread soccer to the world.<br>British teams toured as ?ambassadors? of the new game in Europe. Football players were exported round the British Empire as sailors, soldiers, priests, administrators and traders.<br>Many nations were unimpressed by the restricting ideals of amateurism and<br>the deeply-ingrained British love of rugged combat. In the long run, the soccer that evolved in Europe and South America was more stylish and less physical than the original.<br>From the l900s, new leagues and cup competitions were begun with matching stadiums to house the growing millions of spectators.<br>The first World Cup in 1930 was inaugurated by the recently formed Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). It was played in Uruguay and no British teams took part.<br>THE face of English soccer changed in 1992 with the formation of the FA Carling Premiership - the Premier League. Founder members were: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Coventry, Crystal Palace, Everton, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Norwich, Nottingham Forest, Oldham, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham and Wimbledon, along with newly promoted old second division clubs, Ipswich, Middlesbrough and Blackburn.<br>A multi-million pound TV deal was signed with Rupert Murdoch's satellite station Sky Sports and with the BBC.<br>The inaugural Premier League season gave Manchester United its first league title in 26 years, ahead of two surprising challengers, Aston Villa (40-1 shots before the start of the season) and Norwich City.<br>The TV-led recovery for English clubs has managed to attract some of the best players in the world. Once these stars would have settled for the Italian or Spanish leagues with great clubs like Juventus or Real Madrid. Now they head to England.<br>A legend<br>PELE of Brazil is widely held to be the greatest player soccer has seen. Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in 1940, Pele made his international debut at 16, and at 17 appeared for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup final, scoring two goals in the 5-2 win over Sweden.<br>He won a second winner's medal in 1962, and a third in 1970. His first-class career was spent at Santos (1955-74), then with the New York Cosmos (1975-77) where his presence lifted soccer's image in the US immeasurably.<br>Pele was reported to have been paid $US7 million to come out of retirement and join the Cosmos.<br>He appeared in 1363 first-class games (1955-77) and scored 1281 goals. In Brazil he is a national hero.He was appointed a Sports Minister in the Brazilian Cabinet in December 1994.<br>The nickname Pele does not mean anything, but he was also known as Perola Negra (Black Pearl).<br>This greatest of players was average-sized, but blessed with speed, great balance, tremendous vision, the ability to control the ball superbly, and the ability to shoot powerfully and accurately with either foot and a good header of the ball.<br>Top teams:<br>SEVEN of Europe's top sports magazines choose a European team of the month.
