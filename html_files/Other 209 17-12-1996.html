            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DILBERT is a favourite among Net users, judging by the number of links and references to the irreverent comic strip from home pages on the World Wide Web.<br>The bespectacled character and his office workmates, who appear daily in The West Australian , have a new site which is winning plaudits.<br>Angela Gunn of Yahoo's Y-Life says she is an unashamed devotee of Dilbert and the fun it pokes at the eccentricities and often sheer boredom of office life.<br>She writes that one of the best parts of the new Dilbert Zone site is the Daily Mental Workout .<br>?For those of us not yet entirely resigned to office brain-death, there's a daily dose of pain from the Mensa Genius Quiz-A-Day Book; for the managerial side, there's a weekly version that's not from Mensa. We don't want any heads exploding,? Ms Gunn says.<br>She rates Dilbert as the definitive cartoon strip of the second half of the 1990s.<br>Doonesbury, she says, was the strip for the early 1970s; Garfield in the late 1970s; and Bloom County and Calvin and Hobbes split the 1980s and the first part of the 1990s.<br>???<br>PERTH'S biggest tennis event, the Hopman Cup, starts in less than a fortnight, and it now has its own Web site.<br>So far the site has information about the draw, tickets and booking information.<br>It will add player details and a history of the cup soon.<br>???<br>ALL the results from Saturday's State election are available online at the WA Electoral Commission's excellent site.<br>Bursting with information, it also has demographic profiles of every electorate and maps.<br>???<br>READING of a more literary type is available at Bibliomania.<br>There is access to more than 40 classic novels in HTML format. Among the new arrivals are Anna Karenina, Sons and Lovers and the Last of the Mohicans.<br></font></p>
