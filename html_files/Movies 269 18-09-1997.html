            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>Hercules (G)<br>Disney animation with voices of Tate Donovan, Danny DeVito and James Woods<br>Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker<br>THE latest Disney animated feature, Hercules is certainly as wildly inaccurate with ancient Greek myths as it is possible to be, as some critics have pointed out.<br>But the critics at the preview voted overwhelmingly for it with chuckles and excited faces.<br>They were kids, the target audience. Their parents did not seem to mind this fast and funny frolic either. It appears, on that evidence, that Disney's 35th animated feature will be among the popular ones like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin . . . both cavalier with their original sources.<br>Disney has taken the Greek hero Heracles (the Romans named him Hercules when they borrowed Greek deities) and turned him into an ancient version of Superman or possibly Michael Jordan.<br>The legend says that Hercules was the son of the paramount god of Mount Olympus, Zeus, and a mortal woman named Alcheme. Disney has Hercules as the bonny, bouncing heir of Zeus and his god-wife Hera, who dotes on him.<br>The legend says Hercules was maddened by the vipery of the scheming Hera and murdered his wife and children as a result. He then had to undertake 12 mountainous labours to gain entry to Olympus as an immortal.<br>You might have guessed by now, but Disney gives a somewhat different story, but certainly no less dramatic for young viewers.<br>In the film baby Hercules is stolen from Olympus by Pain and Panic, the wisecracking sidekicks of the king of the underworld Hades (a beautifully voiced vaudeville performance by James Woods, laced with lots of one-liners).<br>Pain and Panic blunder. They fail to kill the baby and also fail to drain him of all his immortal powers, the big one being his massive strength.<br>Young Hercules is raised by a humble farming couple - shades of Clark Kent -and his super strength becomes a nuisance. The locals refer to him as Jerkules when a stray nudge, more like a John Worsfold shirtfront, flattens a village.<br>He seeks guidance which comes in the form of a Zeus lecture (more shades of Christopher Reeve's Superman gaining his wisdom).<br>Then it's off to a mad satyr of a tutor called Phil (Danny DeVito hamming it up for all his crackling worth) and the race is on to become a true hero and enter Olympus.<br>Hades throws down many challenges, including brilliantly created monsters like the Hydra, which keeps growing heads no matter how much young Hercules hacks at it.?Enough with the head-chopping already,? shouts an enraged Phil in the manner of an AFL coach disgusted by too much handball.<br>Hades' chief weapon is not monstrous at all. In his quest to take over Olympus he enlists the curves and coquetishness of Megara, a woman who owes him her life.<br>Naturally she is deadlier than any monster and Hercules has to prove he is smart as well as strong to repel Hades' twin-pronged attack.<br>This is all done at breakneck pace with the computer-generated special effects the Disney team has become so adept at. Coupled with the subtle change in drawing to a simpler, more comic-book style by English cartoonist Gerald Scarfe (responsible for the caricatures in Yes, Minister), Hercules is a visual treat.<br>As well as throwing away the book of Greek myths in the story, it throws away any resemblance to the Greek countryside, ancient or modern, so that viewers are left in no doubt that this is a piece of entertainment, not a retelling of an epic tale.<br>The music, as always with Disney, is bouncy and catchy. It is provided by a Pointer Sisters-Spice Girls type chorus of curvy nymphs, further evidence that this is Hollywood hokum at its most professional.<br></font></p>
