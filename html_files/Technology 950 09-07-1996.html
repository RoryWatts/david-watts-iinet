            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WEB surfers have some perfect excuses for spending hours or even days at their terminals these cold, rainy days.<br>One of the best is Murder on the Net, an interactive site created by the BBC in London which takes advantage of that famous corporation's expertise in intelligent and thoughtprovoking drama.<br>It also probably owes something to the BBC penchant for bureaucracy and overstaffing that has allowed some computer boffin with a major in literature and drama to wall himself off in an undetected cell for months and think up the idea for this Web site.<br>Just when the BBC thought it had lost him in the ether, he pops up with a winner so compelling it just has to go into cyberspace.<br>Murder on the Net is not an easy game, if that is the right word, to play. It needs total concentration and a commitment to stay on the Net for at least a couple of hours to absorb its complexity.<br>The site contains a murder mystery of 15 short chapters. But you cannot read the chapters without solving an Internet-related puzzle which gives you a key to open the text.<br>For example, chapter one cannot be read fully without going to a totally unrelated Web site, registering there and making note of some information at a page that can be accessed by user name and password.<br>The clues, if gathered correctly, form a user name and password which allow you to read chapter one.<br>To gather clues, surfers are taken on a trip through the Net, educating them as they go. Chapter 1 clues are arrived at after a user visits sites giving a history of the Internet.<br>Subsequent chapters deal with e-mail, file transfer protocol, newsgroups, relay chat and multi-user dimensions (or MUDs) among other things.<br>By stepping through the chapters, the user not only learns about Net-related topics, but downloads software like Eudora, Shockwave and even Netscape ... if they are among the 15 per cent of people who don't have it.<br>Each piece of information and software helps yield clues to a grisly little murder yarn.<br>URL: www.murder.tecc.co.uk/<br>???<br>GRISLY murders abound at another fascinating timeconsumer, the official FBI site.<br>You almost expect to hear the theme music and see Efrem Zimbalist Jun from the old TV show when your screen displays the FBI logo and the link to the 10 most wanted fugitives.<br>This is not a pleasant place. Number one on the top 10 fugitives is an ordinary looking, bespectacled man called Ricky Allen Bright. He could pass as an accountant or teacher he looks so benign.<br>But Bright is ?armed and dangerous with suicidal tendencies,? the FBI says. He is accused of kidnapping, rape and sexual assault of a minor. Quite wisely the FBI recommends ?take no action to apprehend this person yourself?.<br>It is a relief, then, to see the dramatic words ?captured? stamped across this mug's mug.<br>But rest assured another villain will take his place at the top. The site not only shows the top 10 but has a link to ?additional fugitives?.<br>URL: www.fbi.gov/<br></font></p>
