            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CRACKERS<br>It was bound to happen - another rough-as-guts Ocker comedy that aspires to be the lovably ugly twin to The Castle. While Rob Sitch and his talented collaborators had an acute understanding of the thinness of the material with which they were dealing, Crackers writer-director David Swann is way too ambitious for his own good, yanking this story about several generations of the dreadful Dredge family coming together for Christmas from one end of the taste and sensibility spectrum to the other. One minute we have the family dog barbecued; the next it's a heart-wrenching melodrama with young hero Joey (Daniel Kellie) pining for his late father, talk about a poor absent brother on drugs and kid-rescues-grandpa ending straight out of a children's television show. Occasionally, there is a gleeful dagginess to some of the gags, usually perpetrated by the Bart Simpson-like Joey. But Swann doesn't know how to mesh the crude, rude funny bits with the skew-whiff attempt to say something meaningful. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>SIDDHARTHA<br>We have had a revival in the music, movies and clothes of the 70s so why not the spiritualism? I'm not talking about Jonathon Livingstone Seagull but the 1973 film adaptation of Herman Hesse's novel about the search for inner peace. First published in 1922 but not given an English translation until the 50s, Siddartha is the story of a young Brahmin whose quest for a meaningful way of life takes him through periods of harsh asceticism, sensual pleasures, material wealth then self-revulsion, leading eventually ?to the oneness and harmony with himself?. If this sounds like the words of Apu, The Simpson's cheerful Quickie Mart proprietor, then Siddharta is probably not the film for you. However, those who are currently crowding into the cinemas too see Kundun will probably appreciate the photography by Sven Nykvist (Ingmar Bergman's regular cameraman) and the serious treatment of the rocky road to enlightenment. At the Luna. Rated PG (not previewed)<br>SPECIES 2<br>HOW could a quality actor like James Cromwell deign to appear in such a trashy movie after giving such a wonderful performance in the brilliant LA Confidential. He took a step down with Deep Impact, but with Species II he's hit rock bottom. Obviously, the money was there. Species II is ridiculous in the extreme, painful to watch and downright laughable. Beautiful Natasha Henstridge reprises her role as the alien who tried to destroy the human race in the first Species but this time she's on our side for a while. Three astronauts go on a mission to Mars and return with an alien infection. When they mate the infection is passed on and monsters hilariously and grotesquesly burst out of the lovers' bodies ripping them apart. Gross. The part-human, part-alien Henstridge must decide whether she will help in the hunt to track down the rogue astronaut-turned-alien or whether she will mate with him. Told you it was stupid. This isn't the kind of movie anyone involved with would proudly take home to show mum. Species II gets half a star for the beautiful babe and half a star for the laughs. Rated MA (Carolyn Martin).<br>TWENTYFOURSEVEN<br>Despite the black-and-white cinematography and the gritty Midlands millieu TwentyFourSeven shouldn't be lumped together with the current crop of depressing post-Thatcherite dramas such as Nil By Mouth or Under the Skin. Lighter in spirit and less confronting in attitude, TwentyFourSeven is closer to The Full Monty or an extended episode of Minder, with a jaunty, never-say-die battler (Bob Hoskins back to his spirited best) who sets out to save the town's youngsters from a boozy-druggy oblivion by reviving the boxing club of his youth. Unfortunately, the problems of his boxers and the objections of the parents get in the way of a Rocky-styled finale. There's a touch of Scorsese in this impressive debut by self-taught 26-year-old director Shane Meadows, with some beautifully constructedsound-and-image sequences and jumpy, semi-improvised verbal jousting. But the rather superficial script doesn't give us enough insight into the Hoskins character for the ultimate tragedy to be deeply felt. At Cinema Paradiso and Greater Union Innaloo. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>Recently out<br>THE APOSTLE<br>In a Hollywood whose idea of a character flaw is uncapped teeth and cellulite-ingrained thighs we must fall to our knees and give thanks and praise for Robert Duvall's Sonny Dewey, a Texas Pentacostal preacher with ?a wandering eye and wickie-wickie ways?. Sonny's struggle to redeem himself, which involves building a church in an impoverished Louisiana town, makes for arguably the year's finest film, a deeply compassionate, powerfully acted drama, in which Duvall arguably gives his best performance to date, about simple, God-fearing folk normally ridiculed by the movie industry. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas).<br>DR DOLITTLE<br>Forget the anal humour and the shameless exploitation of cute children and what you have is a funny and enjoyable very 90s updating of the classic tale about a doctor with a talent for talking to animals. Eddie Murphy gives a surprisingly straight performance in the title role, allowing the humour to bounce off him rather than hamming it up as he sometimes does. And the animals are terrific - not cute and fuzzy but bristling with attitude, funny lines and cynicism, especially the tiger with a chronic headache. Rated PG (David Watts).<br>GREASE<br>It's a little hard to take seriously a musical in which the ?teenagers? were at the time all pushing 30 (Stockard Channing was 34). But the inappropriate casting is part of the campy appeal of Grease, with director Randall Kleiser injecting huge energy and devil-may-care high spirits in bringing the hit stage show to the screen. Sure, it's a TV perennial but colour and movement, great songs and spicy humour (especially from movie-stealing Channing as the tarty Rizzo) can only really be appreciated on the wide-screen with its digitally remastered soundtrack. For a full review, see Today Arts, page 5. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas).<br>SLAPPY AND THE STINKERS<br>Shamelessly borrowing from Free Willy, this Our Gang/Little Rascal-type kiddie-mischief adventure is about five foolish but imaginative children who want to steal a flatulent sea lion named Slappy from the local aquarium and return it to the ocean. Despite its unoriginality, one critic noted that Slappy and the Stinkers has ?a sunny look and a generally brisk pace?. The film's snot-nosed humour, including peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, whipped cream, slushy drinks and bird droppings in the face, as well as the destruction of the school carnival, should appeal to contemporaries of the little stinkers. Rated PG (not previewed).<br>WARRIORS OF VIRTUE<br>While the director and stars of this action-fantasy about a boy sent zooming to the planet Tao where he fights the evil Komodo for control of the Lifesprings are strictly no-name the set design is by Oscar-winning Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). It seems he manages to create a forest planet, with towering trees and everglades, not unlike the Yoda setting in The Empire Strikes Back. The Star Wars influence continues with the advice delivered by the wise Ming to the young hero - "The answer lies within you.? Rated PG (not previewed).<br>Still on<br>ANASTASIA<br>The legend of Princess Anastasia, reputedly the only Romanov child to escape butchering during the Russian Revolution, would seem like an unlikely subject for an all-singing, all-dancing Broadway-style cartoon squarely in the Disney tradition. But veterans Don Bluth and Dan Goldman (Land Before Time, An American Tail) skip lightly over historical fact, astutely landing the blame for the bloody uprising on Rasputin and sticking closely to the 1956 feature film starring Ingrid Bergman. The result is a delightful, pulse-quickening Pygmalion-style romance, one of those rare children's films that will stir the hearts of the young and the young at heart alike. Rated G (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE BIG HIT<br>Hong Kong action director Che-Kirk Wong, known for his work with the Golden Harvest studio and Jackie Chan, makes his Hollywood debut with a black comedy about a hapless hit man (Mark Wahlberg) and his dodgy colleague (a delightfully sinister Lou Diamond Phillips) that's so utterly ridiculous, so full of cliches and contrivances, so bad that it's actually quite good. Outrageous gunfights and explosions, cars falling from trees, dodgy dialogue, bags of body parts and an overdue copy of the video King Kong Lives complete what is most certainly a fun and fluffy if not original film. Rated MA (Sue Yeap).<br>WELCOME TO SARAJEVO<br>With another Sarajevo-style tragedy looming in the Serbian province of Kosovo, this gritty British-made docu-drama about a journalist who becomes personally involved with a war orphan takes on a startling urgency. Based on the memoir by English journalist William Nicholson (Stephen Dillane), Welcome to Sarajevo plunges us into the Balkan heart of darkness, cutting between the frenzied international media trying to do their jobs and the battered Sarajevans trying to stay alive. While this important film is too fragmented to be dramatically involving, few films in recent times have communicated so vividly the terror and outrage of war. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS<br>Harrison Ford and Anne Heche bring considerable charm to this old-fashioned romance about a no-nonsense New York magazine editor stranded on a South Seas desert island with a crusty, hard-drinking pilot. Unfortunately, director Ivan Reitman has succumbed to the panic surrounding the age/sexuality of Ford and Heche. Rather than teasing out the differences between the two leads, which is mandatory for this kind of old-style, wise-cracking, sparring-lovers romantic comedy, Reitman seems too intent on reassuring us that old guy Ford and young lesbian Heche could indeed be a couple, depriving the film of genuine spark. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>DEEP IMPACT<br>The killer wave unleashed by a comet the size of Mt Everest hurtling toward Earth is certainly scary, almost worth the price of admission alone. But what gives you an even queasier feeling than a wall of water moving at the speed of sound is the tsunami of tears unleashed by this Spielberg-produced disaster movie-cum- weepie, in which all the thrills we usually expect of this kind of B-grade fare are swamped by sentiment and slush. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>GODZILLA<br>While the giant lizard, mutated into existence through nuclear testing by the French in the South Pacific during the 60s, can eat tall buildings with a single bite, it looks and moves too much like one of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park critters to be either surprising or scary. Also the tale attached to the monster mash doesn't have much sting in it. Here we have a creature the size of a skyscraper rampaging through the media capital of the world and the heroine (blandly perky Maria Pitillo) is a TV journalist battling for a scoop! Adding to the idiocy is Jean Reno's French secret agent trying to keep his country's errors under wraps. Under wraps! Mon dieu! A monster has destroyed most of New York and all everyone is talking about is keeping things a secret. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas).<br>THE LITTLE MERMAID<br>Ariel's charm, energy and voice are destined to win you over as much as they seduce her handsome, daring admirer Prince Eric in this re-release of Disney's 1989 animated feature, based on a fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen about a mermaid who yearns to tread on dry land. This is Disney animation at its best, the last feature to be totally drawn with no computer-assisted graphics, and it won two Oscars for its wonderful music - one for best score (co-producer and lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken), the other for best song, Under The Sea. Rated G (Christine Walsh).<br></font></p>
