            <h3>Author: DAVID WATTS</h3>
            <h3>Date: 30-04-1999</h3>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MANY moons ago I used to sit next to a man named Voltz in the newsroom of the Sydney Sunday newspaper that employed us. ?Watts and Voltz, what a powerful pair,? our colleagues would chortle, once they had attempted to do the cryptic crossword in the Sydney Morning Herald. As they had little else to do most days of the week, they would chortle about the powerful pair nearly all the time. Small things amuse etc.<br>But a powerful pair we were. Mr Voltz was the deputy chief sub-editor and I was the acting deputy chief sub-editor.<br>This meant that when the real chief sub-editor went to the pub over the road, Mr Voltz became acting chief and I his deputy.<br>When the chief came back and Mr Voltz went to the pub, I remained deputy, but this time to the real chief.<br>On the occasions when Mr Voltz joined the real chief at the pub I became top dog, head pooh-bah . . . and a lot of good it did.<br>Without an acting, acting deputy chief sub-editor, I nearly always ended up ordering myself around because the colleagues - unable to chortle about powerful pairs in the absence of Mr Voltz - stuck their noses back in the cryptic crossword.<br>Invariably I would order myself to go over the road and join the chief and the deputy at the pub.<br>The chief was much consumed by these events. He could see the problem of having no acting, acting deputy and its effect on morale, so he combed the country to find the right sub-editor; one with the surname Amps.<br>It was the chief's ambition to preside over a triumvirate of Voltz, Watts and Amps.<br>His search proved fruitless. Tired of this power game, I upped and ran away to Perth in the hope I would find a more amiable set of surnames.<br>I did. Such is the power of names. Nowhere is this more evident than the world of sport.<br>When rugby league tried to grab a foothold here, much thought was given to the name of the team. Roy and H.G. on radio were of the opinion that Perth's entry should be ?something organic like Perth Nazis or The Hate?.<br>Their suggestion was not taken up and we saw the short life of the Reds, that is red as in red kangaroo. Though big red roos do not normally bounce down Hay Street, it made more sense than a lot of the names that have been around for years.<br>When, for example, did you last see a falcon flying over Charles Street in West Perth, or a royal walking down Bulwer Street in East Perth?<br>And the last known siting of a tiger in trendy St Quentins Avenue, Claremont, was . . . well, never. The demons around Belmont and the lions of Subiaco also exist only in the minds of the creative, or demented.<br>The same goes for the national competition, the AFL. If people were fair dinkum, it would be the Richmond Street Kids and the Collingwood High-Rise Flats.<br>The last kangaroo seen in North Melbourne was diced up in a packet of pet food at the Vic Markets.<br>You would think, then, that the Dockers was a spot-on moniker for Fremantle, with its rich maritime heritage and wharf labour.<br>But last Sunday I had the great pleasure of watching a moving Anzac Day ceremony at Subiaco, then the distinct displeasure of watching two hours of the Brisbane Lions devouring the inept Dockers.<br>The trouble is that Dockers rhymes far too easily with shockers. Although no one has heard the players sing the club song after a victory since the middle of last year, more than a few wags have been giving the following version a go:<br>Freo away we go, Try to hit em hard, Then away we go, Freo makes us all heave-ho, We are the Freo Shockers.<br>I hope I eat my words on Sunday.<br></font></p>
