            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you are lucky, life is full of choices. Sometimes they do not seem very good.<br>For example: You are watching TV inmid-afternoon and you can a) watch Oprah or b) watch Ricki Lake.<br>Or, you are listening to radio in the morning and the choice is a) Howard Sattler or b) disc jockeys on (fill in FM station) mangling the language.<br>See what I mean. Freedom of choice would allow you to toss in c) none of the above in both situations. We do not always have that freedom though.<br>It is no different in the world of home computing.<br>Last week, I had to make a choice that at the time was as gut-wrenching as the one Meryl Streep was forced into in the film Sophie's Choice. She had to pick which of her children should die.<br>I had to choose between Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Communicator. Netscape lost and was uninstalled into the ether. I think I almost shed a tear. Along with it went my Eudora Pro e-mail program.<br>The dastardly deed was forced on me by Microsoft. The Seattle software behemoth has produced Front Page 98, a joint Web server and HTML editor. It is so good I can't keep my hands off it.<br>It is light, easy to follow, right up to date with the latest HTML developments such as Cascading Style Sheets and just happens to consume 35Mb of my hard disk.<br>A couple of weeks ago I tried it and uninstalled it within an hour because my 540Mb drive shrank to 10Mb of free space, which is barely enough for a good, solid surf of the Web, let alone to contemplate adding new games or programs.<br>But then I had not become steely and was not prepared to sacrifice MSIE or Netscape or Eudora ? or anything to be truthful. I think the shrinks call it anal retention.<br>In the weeks that followed, I played a sort of mental two-up. Heads and MSIE goes, tails and it's curtains for Netscape.<br>But a deeper analysis was needed. I looked at my PC with its MSIE 4.0 interface enabling me to view folders as Web pages, bring documents to screen with one click and navigate of the Net as if it were my own computer. I liked it.<br>I also liked the true full-screen display when browsing Web pages, the drop-down window for favourites, history and search tools. I did not like the degradation in system performance nor the growing rattling of the hard disk as it whirled through harder programs. Nor did I like Channels, which looked pretty but were slow and worked only occasionally.<br>Then I looked at Communicator. I liked its easy-to-use bookmarks and mail and news that did not require a separate program to be launched. I liked the slightly faster browsing and the fast built-in Netscape Composer HTML editor.<br>I did not like Netcaster Channels, which took ages to display, then nearly always crashed. I did not like that Communicator was more prone to crashes than MSIE seemed.<br>In the end, the choice was between a total computing suite or a total Net suite. Poor reliable Eudora got the flick because I could see no reason to have an extra mailer.<br>People who use their PCs for a lot more than the Net, people who revel in DOS or Unix and those who don't have to worry like this because they're on a Mac, would doubtless call for the head of MSIE.<br>In fact, when I installed MSIE 4.0 on a PC in the Access office, long-time Mac user Sue Yeap uttered a strangled cry of ?good grief? when she saw how it took over the operating system.<br>But I like it because I use the Net a lot and having the same logic and interface for it and my computer seems more than reasonable.<br>It is more than a fair bet that new PC users - who have not had years of double-clicking - will not worry about such an interface either when it is brought to the world via Windows98 next year.<br>It certainly is on my PC for the foreseeable future.<br>However ? I've just taken delivery of a trial version of the MS Visual InterDev Web solutions kit. It needs 65Mb of space. I have 72. What will I get rid of?<br>Quake? No, it's too close to Christmas and the boy would be heartbroken. Paint Shop? Ditto the girl. It's a worry. Dear Santa, can I have a 2.1Gb disk please?<br></font></p>
