            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE are few sadder sights on television than a downcast, beaten and bleeding West Indies cricket team.<br>Such a sight is matched for viewer depression only by repeats of the Brady Bunch or endless playing of commercials for curtains, fabrics or tiles.<br>The personification of the downcast cricketer is Curtly Ambrose. The giant fast bowler cannot hide when he adopts a hang-dog look.<br>The end result is fielding that would make a teeball team blush.<br>This was evident as the second Test in Sydney wound to its inevitable conclusion last Tuesday.<br>There was an occasion where Ambrose, with the job of saving vital runs, ambled after a ball that might have just been worth a run.<br>He missed it, the ensuing fumble carried the ball metres away and Ambrose failed to give chase. A teammate finally cut it down but the Australians ran three.<br>All Ambrose could do was raise a goofy grin. This was upsetting because that face should never have anything but a batsmen-hating glower on it.<br>It was a terrible measure of how out of sorts the Windies are. When they are good, they are very good, but when they bad they are a disgrace.<br>One hopes the father figure of Clive Lloyd, as manager, can start to mend the broken spirits. He has what should be excellent support from the surprisingly round figure of former great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall, one of the most inspirational and deadly cricketers in history.<br>Adding weight is TV commentator Michael Holding, another speed great, who is trying to rally the troops by shaming them.<br>Appropriate really: those with long memories may recall the 1975-76 series when a young, but raw Holding ? replete with afro hairstyle ? sat glumly on the ground for at least five minutes after an lbw decision was refused.<br>It took all of Lloyd's persuasive powers to bring him back to the fold. The Windies were thrashed that series, but shortly after became the greatest power of post-war cricket.<br>That poorly attended Sydney Test last week deserves special mention for an incident, which TV viewers must be seeing in their dreams because it was replayed so much.<br>Poor Matthew Elliot's collision with Mark Waugh was tragic, but the interesting thing was Carl Hooper's total failure to recognise that Waugh was miles out of his crease.<br>Possible reasons are that Hooper acted instinctively by throwing to keeper Courtney Browne (isn't he copping commentary flak?); or that he misjudged relative distances of the batsmen from their creases; or he did a Wally Grout.<br>On the 1964 tour of England, the gritty Queensland keeper refused to remove the bails to run out an Englishman who had collided with his partner.<br>Better TV moments came yesterday. First very early with Channel Seven showing the all-conquering Australian rugby union team thrashing the Barbarians 39-12 in front of 75,000 at Twickenham.<br>On SBS, Perth Glory was rampant in the 5-1 win over Brisbane. The Perth boys scored five unanswered goals in 68 minutes which would have had Queenslanders crying over their mud crabs and Fourex.<br></font></p>
