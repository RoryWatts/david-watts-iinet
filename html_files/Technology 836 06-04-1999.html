            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet has emerged as an important weapon in the Kosovo conflict. It is being used as a propaganda tool by all sides, as well as a medium to distribute news reports that otherwise would be difficult to obtain.<br>And civilians are using e-mail and chat sites to tell of their experiences during Nato or Yugoslav attacks.<br>The opening air raids on Belgrade by Nato prompted this vivid description at a Web chat forum: ?There was heavy air-raid on Belgrade. Warning sirens turned on after series of heavy detonations ... Whole building in which I live was shaking like it was an earthquake and windows screeched. I was almost blinded with great orange-red ball of fire,? the man wrote.<br>The Kosovo Liberation Army has even used the Net to offer protection to any Western reporters who want to cover the conflict within the province.<br>?Your contribution towards a fair and accurate information about the events will enable the world to learn of the inhuman massacres committed by the paramilitary and terrorist army of the Belgrade regime in revenge to the Nato strikes,? the KLA's message at the Kosovo Info site says.<br>Western journalists are being expelled from Yugoslavia and traditional information sources are being strictly controlled.<br>But computers are reportedly common and Serbian Information Minister Aleksander Vucic is regarded as an Internet buff.<br>His awareness of the medium's ability to puncture official propaganda has led him to toughen freedom of information legislation. A new clause on ?verbal deceit? relates directly to the Net. Penalties range from fines to sites being shut down.<br>Still the Net is allowing a flood of news and views to break out.<br>Much of it is propaganda with both main sides, Serbia and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, using Web sites to present their cases.<br>The Serbia Information site last week was comparing the Nato attacks with nazi Germany's during World War II. It also made use of pictures of pleading children and of a bombed Belgrade in 1941 to direct attention to headlines such as ?A Layer of Diplomacy - a Layer of Bombs?.<br>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has been putting the Nato side to Serbian surfers via the Foreign Office home page.<br>In his Net message, Mr Cook claimed the NATO air war is not directed at the Serbian people but is solely aimed at averting a human catastrophe in Kosovo.<br>The United States Information Agency hosts a Kosovo site at which it puts official views from President Bill Clinton and Nato. It carries links to Voice of America sites in both Albanian and Serb languages.<br>Hard news from affected areas is more difficult to find.<br>Serb authorities have shut Belgrade radio station B92, an award-winning source of dissident views. But the station has managed to stay on air by opening a Web site in the Netherlands.<br>From there it presents the latest news e-mailed in under great risk from correspondents in Yugoslavia.<br>It also provides an audio feed of news broadcasts that can be heard easily by people in the Balkans who have the right software.<br>A B92 spokesman in Britain, Julia Glyn-Pickett, told the Guardian newspaper last week that the site was essential. People who could access it in Belgrade were printing out its information and distributing it to news-starved people in the city.<br>The B92 site leads to a feedback forum that allows people from all over the world to put their views and experiences on a global virtual bulletin board.<br>Kosovo Info has uncensored reports and sometimes pictures, rounding up news from many of the other media outlets in Kosovo. Eyewitness reports of Serbian shelling and Nato attacks are among the site's highlights.<br>The Kosovo Crisis Centre publishes three news reports a day, mainly detailing the Serbian forces' movements and attacks.<br>Another news site, Kosova Press, publishes short news reports all day, focused on the location and severity of the latest Serbian military operations. News from a Serbian point of view is available at the Serbian Unity Congress. The congress also hosts the Yugoslav State-run news agency Tanjug.<br>The refugee crisis is one of the topics under the microscope at the Human Rights Watch's Kosovo Focus section. The site has an information bulletin, statements about the refugee situation and reports on repression of the media.<br>A very human view of the events in Kosovo is provided by Father Sava Janjic, a monk at a 14th century Serbian Orthodox monastery in the province. He maintains a Web site, a mailing list and even a chat room, and constantly updates news.<br>HELP DESK<br>Kosovo sites (BBC special): news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special-report/<br>1998/kosovo/newsid-305 links: www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1998/10/kosovo/related.sites/<br>Kosovo Info: www.kosovainfo.com/ENGLISH.htm<br>Serbia Information: www.serbia-info.com<br>US Information Agency: www.usia.gov/regional/eur/balkans/<br>kosovo/homepage.htm<br>Radio B92: www.b92.net<br>Chat forum: www.v2.nl/mail/v2east/<br>Serbian Unity Congress: www.suc.org<br>Tanjug: www.suc.org/news/tanjug/<br>Human Rights Watch Kosovo Focus: www.hrw.org/hrw/campaigns/<br>kosovo98/index.htm<br>Father Janjic: www.egroups.com/list/kosovo/517.html<br></font></p>
