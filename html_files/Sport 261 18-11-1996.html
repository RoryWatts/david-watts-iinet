            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT a difference a crowd makes. A very ordinary game of English Premier League soccer seems way ahead of a crackerjack Australian National Soccer League game, simply because there is more crowd atmosphere.<br>Rich green turf that enables the ball to bounce nicely also helps for more controlled play than our hard, patchy surfaces. Here the ball can bounce unpredictably, causing promising moves to end in scrappy tatters.<br>But I don't want to write about soccer this week. My crowd comments apply particularly to a sport that should never have hogged prime-time TV last week.<br>p Channel Nine showed three hours of the David Boon testimonial match from the MCG on Tuesday, managing in the process to carve up both afternoon and prime-time evening viewing.<br>This would have been okay if the match between Boon's Southern Sons and Allan Border's Island Knights had been a worthy televisual sport. But it was not. Nine manufactured a brand of cricket - something it has done for a few years now - that should go no further than a local park.<br>Former players, most of whom were well out of touch, current players, who should have been concentrating on the serious games coming, and several AFL players, who caught the little red ball as well as they do a Sherrin, all dressed in casual gear for what was little more than a hit and a giggle.<br>Sure Boon deserves a big send-off, and sure charity benefited - but the people stayed away in droves.<br>Despite Bill Lawry's optimistic predictions that the crowd was building up, only 5000 dropped into the cavernous MCG. It made a pitiful spectacle, accompanying as it did a lot of out-of-touch cricket full of windy woof, agricultural batting and ordinary bowling.<br>Boon deserved better than to be remembered by a charade on TV.<br>One of the game's great fighters, he was the cornerstone of Australian batting as the Test team struggled out of a big hole in the 1980s.<br>In fact at Launceston on Thursday, a local Boon farewell match between the same sides packed the NTCA ground with 5000-6000 people. Where was Nine?<br>What agenda does the station have by presenting this type of tomfoolery as major sport?<br>Surely no one is considering having umpires, fieldsmen and even batsmen wired up so they can have jokey conversations with Ian Chappell while the bowler steams in.<br>Let us hope not.<br>???<br>HIGHLIGHT of the first day of the Australian PGA, shown on Channel Ten last Thursday, was undoubtedly Mike Clayton's muffed putt. The Australian had putted to what looked like a gnat's wing of the cup. But he threw his putter in the air in frustration, no doubt aiming to catch it on the way down.<br>Unfortunately, it didn't come down to him. It went away from him, hit the still-moving ball and knocked it a couple of metres farther away.<br>Clayton stumbled forward, fumbled the putter and lay flat on the ground in disbelief.<br>The sight of Sydney's southerly buster blowing balls off the green and causing play to stop was a rare highlight, too.<br></font></p>
