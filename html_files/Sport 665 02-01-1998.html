            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOME cruel and heartless people think running quizzes instead of writing columns is lazy. One particularly gorgeous GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) from Melbourne said this straight to my face: ?These quizzes are just a cop-out, aren't they David??<br>She had a point. They do not require much creativity, unless it is in the manufacturing of deliberate errors like saying the 1910 Fruitgum Company, and not Ohio Express, was responsible for Yummy, Yummy, Yummy. By the way, one colleague complained that the music quiz was too hard and the only answer he got right was the 1910 Fruitgum Company.<br>I was fortunate to escape with my eye-patch intact.<br>But where were we? The GYM claimed I was copping out. I prefer to say I am purging myself.<br>Can you imagine going through a whole year knowing that the Great Gazoo was the little green man on Fred Flintstone's shoulder? These things have to be exorcised like demons. They - those floating pieces of trivia - clog the neurones and make it virtually impossible to remember the wife's birthday, PINs, passwords or sometimes children's names (they've been called by the dog's name more than once).<br>So, not copping out, but exorcising, here are a few questions of sport. The reader who doubted I would have darts questions, concentrating on footy and cricket instead, can judge for herself (she may be right). Here we go:<br>1) Fill in the missing lyrics.<br>Here come the -- and -- is the game<br>We're all together and -- is our --<br>So we'll play on through the --- ---<br>And bring the -- back again<br>2) Who sang this?<br>3) Did they do what their song promised?<br>4) What was the B side of this record?<br>5) Pick the odd man out: Tom Graveney, Viv Richards, Sam Trimble, Allan Border, Peter Burge.<br>6) West Indians are lovely cricketers, they also have lovely names. Give the full names of the following:<br>Sobers, Hall, Richards, Greenidge?<br>7) Bill Lawry is a pigeon fancier. His other great love - and the one that gave him his nickname -was what?<br>8) Who first took 300 wickets in Tests?<br>9) What county did he play for?<br>10) Complete the following: Lord Fury; Even Stevens; Gattum Gattum; Polo Prince; -- --.<br>11) What are they and when were they?<br>12) Can Peter Matera kick a torpedo, or what?<br>13) Which Eagle did Mick Malthouse say was the team's best kick for goal under pressure?<br>14) John, Ken and Dick were three brothers from Parramatta who played for Australia in either rugby union or rugby league or both. What is their surname?<br>15) Who won this year's Australian Rugby League (ARL) grand final?<br>16) Against whom?<br>17) Who won the Rupert Murdoch version?<br>18) Where was the Rumble in the Jungle?<br>19) Who was it between?<br>20) Who won?<br>21) Was he any good?<br>22) Odd one out time: Bob Beamon, Maureen Caird, Ralph Doubell, Carl Lewis.<br>23) How many gold medals did Australia win at Montreal in 1976?<br>24) What 60s surfing movie did Murray Rose make a splash in? (and for a clever person bonus: which son of a very famous actor also featured?)<br>25) Where was Pat Rafter born?<br>26) Sing the Dockers' club song if you can.<br>ANSWERS: 1) Aussies, cricket, winning, aim, English rain, Ashes 2) 1972 Australian cricket team in England 3) No. It was 2-2. England retained the urn they won in 1970-71 4) Bowl a Ball, Swing a Bat 5) Burge (they all were top batsmen for Queensland, but only Burge was born there . . . Trimble was born in northern NSW). 6) Garfield St Auburn, Wesley Winfield, Isaac Vivian Alexander, Cuthbert Gordon 7) Reading Phantom comics 8) Fred Trueman 9) Yorkshire 10) Light Fingers 11) Melbourne Cup winners 1961-65 12) Absolutely 13) Shane Sikora 14) Thornett 15) Newcastle 16) Manly 17) Brisbane Broncos 18) Kinshasa, Zaire 19) George Foreman and Muhammad Ali 20) Ali 21) Does a bear sleep in the woods? 22) Lewis (the others all won gold medals at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. Lewis won his first gold in Los Angeles in 1984) 23) None if you must know 24) Ride the Wild Surf (he played Swag. James Mitchum, son of Robert, was a surfie). 25) Mt Isa 26) Freo Heave Ho, Freo Heave Ho etc etc etc . . . well done.<br></font></p>
