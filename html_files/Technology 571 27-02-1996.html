            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DONKEYS kick, globes spin and an unseen hand writes a letter and puts it in an envelope on the home page of one of the most impressive sites on the World Wide Web.<br>And it is a wholly West Australian site, run from home by Perth couple Linelle and Bob Griffiths.<br>The Griffiths are heavily interested in medical service and care - Linelle is a critical care nurse and Bob was with the St John Ambulance service.<br>Their site reflects these interests with many links to the medical world and a particularly impressive one to the Ying and Yang anti-smoking site.<br>Mr Griffiths has included a link to the West Australian Ambulance Service and the couple feature on their main link a page about their Balingup farm, Shambalah (a Zulu word meaning safe and peaceful watering hole for all creatures).<br>This graphic-rich link features more animated kicking donkeys and big graphics of a dog and a donkey ... mainstays of the farm.<br>Not content with simply providing links to search engines such as Lycos and Yahoo, the Griffiths have built in a multiple search engine into their home page.<br>???<br>ALL THAT'S missing are the Jaffas and chocolate bombs at Lumiere Cinemas' new Web site.<br>A graphic home page is artwork of the Wellington Street cinemas' foyer with neat signposts to the candy bar, information pillar, box office and the two cinemas.<br>Clicking on any of these will take the user to different information sites where they are told session times, coming attractions and what is on now.<br>The site also gives a history of film pioneers the Lumiere brothers, and there is an archive of some of their work.<br>???<br>BUNBURY'S Dolphin Discovery Centre is on the Web with a good package of information about the mammals who are fond of interacting with humans at Koombana Bay.<br>The site also has links to dolphin information pages around the world.<br></font></p>
