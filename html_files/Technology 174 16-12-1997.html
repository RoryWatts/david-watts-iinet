            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>Glenn Davis brought the Net world the Cool Site of the Day/Year back in 1994 (almost pre-history in terms of the Web). He became disenchanted with the way CSOD diverged from its original concept of encouraging good design and Web development and, he claims, became too populist.So Davis departed and started Project Cool. And it is cool as well as being highly informative about the development and future of the Web. Striking use is made of Dynamic HTML, so a version 4 browser is recommended. That way you can be sure of seeing planet Saturn float galleon-like across the welcome screen. And you can learn how to make the same sort of visual statement with Java.<br>But best of all are the Cool Sightings which present the best in new and cool design and show how beautiful a Web site can be. (DW)<br>The Constitutional Convention<br>Will the Constitutional Convention next February turn into an acrimonious gab-fest and a waste of taxpayers' money? Who knows. We'll have to wait until February to find out whether it would have been simpler to ask the Australian people in a referendum whether they want a republic.In the meantime, this official Government site is a good starting point to learn what the convention is all about. From here, if you are interested in the country's future, you can branch out to other links to find more information on the republic debate.<br>Some simple links from this site are: How our existing system works, Options and the issues, A Word from two groups, Australian Republican Movement and Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, and Fact or Fantasy (some fallacies exposed). (DW)<br>Musee d'Orsay<br>The Musee d'Orsay in Paris houses possibly the best collection of impressionist art in the world. A real-world browse of the museum takes a whole day and leaves the lover of beauty breathless for more. A virtual browse using the museum's official Web site is frankly not as fulfilling. But beggars can't be choosers.<br>You will see works by Gauguin, Van Gogh, Seurat, Degas, Manet and Cezanne, among others. No one said computers couldn't be artistic, did they?A warning: this site is entirely in French but if you can't speak it, don't worry, because it's fairly easy to follow. (DW)<br>Overland 4WD Safaris<br>The north-west of our fair State is a popular holiday and adventure destination, becoming even more so given the increasing number of Web sites devoted to the region. The latest was submitted by reader John Waugh, of Overland 4WD Safaris. Established in 1993, the family business claims to be the ?makers of the ultimate Aussie outback adventures?.The main page features an animated photo sequence of a 4WD driving past scenery including emus and rock formations. There are links to details about the safaris (including vehicles and equipment used), an FAQ, plus a satellite photo and link to the current weather conditions.A highlights-of-WA section is still under construction but has a number of photos including sheep shearing and wildflowers.Most importantly, there's a guide to the different safaris available, ranging from the original and still popular five-day Monkey Mia safari to adventures designed to suit your own needs.
