            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NEW RELEASES<br>APT PUPIL<br>Bryan Singer follows up his hit thriller The Usual Suspects with a drama about a schoolboy named Todd (Brad Renfro) who discovers nazi war criminal (Ian McKellen) is secretly living in his town. Rather than immediately going to the authorities Todd resorts to blackmail, threatening to expose McKellen's Kurt Dussander unless he tells him the truth about his nazi past. ?I want to hear about it,? he says. ?The stories. Everything. Everything they're afraid to tell us in school.? Adapted from the same collection of Stephen King stories that yielded Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption. Rated MA<br>8 MM<br>Nicolas Cage is a private investigator hired by a rich widow who has found in the safe of her late husband what appears to be a snuff movie. She wants reassurance from Cage's Tom Welles that the girl in the film didn't really die. Welles' investigation leads him into the hidden world of the Hollywood sex business, where he connects with Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), an adult bookstore clerk who guides the detective through the circles of porno hell. From Seven screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker and director Joel Schumacher (who did the last two Batman movies). Rated R LOLITA<br>Now you can see what all the fuss was about: Adrian Lyne's lush adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel about a middle-aged European (Jeremy Irons) who marries a frumpy American widow (Melanie Griffiths) so he can have his way with her 14-year-old daughter (Dominique Swain). While Stanley Kubrick brought out the darkly comic side of Nabokov's original story Lyne treats it as a love story, with Irons' Humbert Humbert a surprisingly sympathetic figure. Which, according to Lyne, is why the film has raised so much ire. Rated R<br>OFFICE SPACE<br>Mike Judge, creator of the cult cartoon series Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill, makes his big screen debut with this satire about office politics. Ron Livingston plays a lowly computer programmer who, as a result of a hypnosis session gone wrong, is suspended permanently in a state of happy nonchalance - miraculously reborn as a carefree guy relieved of all anxieties regarding work, money and love. Talk Radio's Gary Cole stars as the smiley, buck-passing, back-stabbing middle manager, Bill Lumberg. Rated M<br>TWO GIRLS AND A GUY<br>Writer-director James Toback and star Robert Downey Jnr, who worked together on The Pick-Up Artist (1987), reunite for this intimate three-hander about a womanising actor confronted by the two women to whom he has professed undying love. While the women, Natasha Gregson Wagner and Heather Graham, accuse Downey Jnr's actor of being a cheating, lying SOB he valiantly defends himself ("I'm an actor. Actors lie?.) Rated MA<br>RECENTLY OUT<br>A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES<br>HHHH<br>Lovely Sonia Horowitz seems to have it all: a baby, a handsome, scholarly husband and a secure family place within New York's close-knit Hasidic Jewish community. But Sonia (played by the luminous Renee Zeggweller) yearns for the kind of freedom denied her by the extreme religious beliefs of her community. The chance for independence comes when her brother-in-law offers her a job as a valuer in his jewellery business. But the price is sexual attachment to the venal relative, who exploits her desire for independence. This fine film by Boaz Yakin is a subtle portrait of a woman searching for independence and learning the price to be paid. Strong performances all round, and one of the more mature, intelligent films on the current circuit. (Rated M) Ron Banks.<br>CENTRAL STATION<br>HHHH<br>Nothing original in the premise of a cranky, selfish older woman becoming the protector of a child after the death of his parents. However, what matters is not the particular journey director Walter Salles takes us on in this Brazilian variant of the American road movie, which is fairly predictable, but the graceful, tender yet thoroughly unsentimental way he develops the fractious relationship between odd couple Dora and little Josue. What elevates the film is the beautifully nuanced performance of veteran stage actress Fernanda Montenegro, who deservedly was nominated for a best actress Oscar and could legitimately cry, in best bitter Dora fashion, ?I was robbed?. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>CRUEL INTENTIONS<br>HHH ½<br>First-time writer-director Roger Kumble strains a little in resetting Liaisons Dangereuses among privileged teens in Manhattan's Upper East Side; reputation does not quite have the same impact as it did back in 1782 and the writing of letters seems quaint, almost anachronistic in this era of mobile phones and e-mail. Kumble, however, has created some very credible equivalents of the sexy seducers Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil in the spoiled preppy brats played with zing by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe, with enough witty barbs to lift it above the level of the average teen-oriented pic. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>HILARY AND JACKIE<br>HHH<br>While many have complained that this bio-pic of cellist Jacqueline du Pre is an outrageous falsification, especially a scene in which du Pre sleeps with her sister's husband, the real problem with the film is that the sensational stuff is largely irrelevant. It's just thrown in, like a naughty anecdote told among the chattering classes. There is very little in this stylish, swift-moving but frustratingly elliptical film that provides insight into either the genius or the emotional problems of great British cellist - just lots of scenes of her playing Elgar in her famously passionate, head-flinging style and moments of madness (stripping off in the forest etc). Worth seeing for the fine performances of Emily Watson as Jacqueline and Rachel Griffiths as her less talented younger sister Hilary. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE MATRIX<br>HHH ½<br>With numerous Lewis Carroll references muddled in with compuspeak and plenty of spiritual mumbo jumbo the first half of The Matrix labours under the misapprehension it is a cross between a cyberpunk hacker film and some type of futuristic Alice In Wonderland. However, in the last 45 minutes the oracles and prophecies take a back seat to the business of a rescue mission, complete with computer-enhanced bullets dancing across the screen. It takes on the feel of a dangerous and expensive computer game, complete with pummelling techno-rock soundtrack. The Matrix is a triumph of style and stunts over plot substance, but it will surely give you a bigger buzz than anything on your home computer. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE<br>HH ½<br>Kevin Costner is just too perfect playing a boat-builder grieving for his dead wife. He's only ever loved one other woman in his life, chooses his few words carefully, has poetry in his soul, is great with children and older folk and always immaculately dressed. So much time is spent capturing the tasteful country life, magazine-type details that this leaden air-brushed romance between Costner's Garret Blake and Robin Wright Penn's Theresa never achieves the passion that justifies its final-reel spill into tragedy. Paul Newman as Garret's old coot father adds some body to this watery soup. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE RUGRATS MOVIE<br>HHH<br>Children will love the way the popular Rugrats has grown from the TV screen to 90 minutes of wild adventure. Chucky, Tommy, Phil and Lill and to a lesser extent, Angelica, are propelled into the woods after failing to exchange Tommy's new little brother, Dil, at the ?baby store? (for grown-ups, that's the hospital). Wolves, storms and a group of escaped circus monkeys lie between the Rugrats and home. The expansion to the big screen adds colour, better graphics and wilder stories, but does take away from some of the characterisation and witty dialogue that has made the TV show so popular with all age groups. Rated G ( David Watts)<br>SHE'S ALL THAT<br>HHH ½<br>On the face of it, She's All That looks like just another teen romance where rich/cool boy falls for poor/dorky girl. But this one is peppered with delightful characters, savvy dialogue and such savage put-downs I'd be scared to set foot in this California high school. Its story involves an unlikely friendship that blooms into romance when cool Zack takes a wager that he can win over Laney, who is more turned on by art than boys. There is enough spunk in the scenes to lift She's All That above the deluge of teen films dominating our screens. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>VARSITY BLUES<br>HH<br>All the stereotypes and cliches about small-town America and heroism are here. Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek plays understudy to the high school football team's star quarterback. He is thrust into the limelight when the star is injured. Not only does he lock horns with the dictatorial coach Kilmer (Jon Voight as reptilian as ever), but he must fight off the chief cheerleader in a whipped cream bikini. The happiness of the small town of West Canaan depends on him and the last seven seconds of the last game of the year. It is almost futile to condemn Varsity Blues because teen audiences seem to thrive on this celluloid version of junk food. Rated M (David Watts)<br></font></p>
