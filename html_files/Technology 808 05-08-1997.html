            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Feeling confused? The language of computing is daunting for new users.<br>What is a gopher, or WAIS, or MIME, for instance? Can you cope with POP, HTML, SMTP and WYSIWYG?<br>Happily, the Web has the answers to an incredible range of subjects. Some sites claim to know the meaning of life.<br>Technical explanations abound for new and allegedly experienced users alike.<br>One of the better sources is the TechWeb Technology Encyclopedia. Rather than offer pages and pages of book-like alphabetical listings like a traditional encyclopaedia or dictionary, TechWeb offers a search engine.<br>Simply key in the technical term or phrase you need to know, and the encyclopaedia provides either a simple sentence or a detailed chapter, depending on the type of query. For instance, tap in ?World Wide Web? and you are given a comprehensive history of its development with cross-references to subjects such as HTML and the history of the Net itself.<br>The other factor which sets TechWeb apart from other technical tools is the ability - for Windows95 users at least - to download a demonstration copy of the multimedia version of the database.<br>Weighing in at only 660Kb, the demo enables users to set up their own technical encyclopaedia on the desktop.<br>Being a demo, it is somewhat crippled. It has no pictures, for example, and several categories are missing. But it offers a taste of what a $40 CD version of the software might bring.<br>Elsewhere, simple and effective translation of technical jargon is available at Netdictionary and Whatis.<br>Both are more traditional dictionary sites but offer quick references and a reasonable amount of humour, including geek-speak.<br></font></p>
