            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Few words chill the hearts of parents of primary schoolchildren more than ?project?. Combined with ?It's due in two days?, it is a recipe for fear and loathing.<br>Non-Netizen parents often envy those who are connected. Quick surfs of the Web any time of the day or night must reap more than browsing the reference shelves of the local library in business hours, they seem to think.<br>But as Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs sang: ?It ain't necessarily so?.<br>The Web is a vast resource. Unfortunately, it has as many design faults as useful features.<br>You can find listings of all the episodes of the X Files, for example, but look for the habits of the Shark Bay mouse and you're as starved for resources as it sometimes is.<br>My most recent foray into project-land was a head-aching hunt for the chuditch, a strikingly spotted wild marsupial cat high on the threatened species list in Australia. It turned out that the Web hunt need not have been so painful. I found this out after the project was due. But let's go back to the start.<br>A fast way to find information on the Web is to plug the word or phrase you are looking for into a search engine. The theory is that many site addresses will be displayed quickly and you will be gratified with a fascinating array of facts.<br>The practice is somewhat different. My first ever Web search for meaningful information on a former WA premier unearthed a cast list of an early Star Trek episode which had an actor called Carmen Lawrence playing a Klingon.<br>With that in mind, I narrowed my chuditch search to WA resources only, using the search facility at the State Government's informative site.<br>This uncovered seven documents. Unfortunately, none had more than an obscure reference to the chuditch and two were identical, huge (160K) sheets which mentioned the threatened marsupial only once.<br>These two documents were put out under photos of Attorney-General Peter Foss and Environment Minister Cheryl Edwardes and were entitled ?Status of the Government's election commitments on the environment February 1993-December 1996?.<br>Apart from the cool title, the documents were more of a strategy to ensure the survival of politicians than native animals. So I hopped to the federal sphere and threw ?chuditch? to the mercy of the Environment Australia Online search engine.<br>The site, which comes under the power of the Federal Environment, Sport and Territories departments, delivered a few bytes of helpful information, a drawing of the chuditch, a map showing where it lives compared with where it once thrived and the action plan aimed at bolstering the population from its present level of 6000.<br>In the meantime, a quick shuffle through the library at The West Australian produced a marvellously simple description of the chuditch, its appearance, mating habits, diet, etc, which formed the main part of the school project.<br>The project completed, I had a good, hard look at myself and decided to redo the exercise from a very conventional Web viewpoint.<br>I typed ?chuditch? into the AltaVista search engine, the most popular in Australia. AltaVista's first four listings were exactly what the school project wanted; simple, brief descriptions of everything to do with the animal.<br>And where were they? At the Perth Zoo site, of course (the zoo breeds chuditches as part of a survival strategy). The zoo just happens to be on the WA Government server and was also reachable through an excellent resource called Edsite WA.<br>Oh what a tangled Web we've weaved.<br>HELP DESK<br>Search engine: A Web site where you can searches databases for keywords.
