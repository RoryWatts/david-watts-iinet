            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HOSTILE users have forced one of Australia's most-visited Web sites to drop soft-pornography advertising banners.<br>AAA's Matilda search engine ran the banners for two weeks. But irate users complained so heavily that site editor Keith Ashton opened a forum last weekend on whether AAA should carry such ads.<br>More than 10,000 people had their say by last Friday, with 95 per cent of them vigorously opposed.<br>?They were very, very hostile,? he said. ?We received thousands of e-mails and the Messageboard was flooded. Sex is a no-no to our diverse following, it seems.?<br>Mr Ashton believes the soft-porn advertising may have done serious damage to the site's reputation. But at the same time he was cheered that so many users had spoken up.<br>?It's nice when there's a human reaction,? he said. ?People do care. When we started running the ads, many asked "Do you need help to pay your bills??<br>In fact, AAA was a victim of its own success. Heavy traffic had led to use of increased bandwidth and a big Telstra bill.<br>Mr Ashton said an offshoot of the 100 hot group in the US had lobbied AAA for three years to run its ads for adult sites. The offer was hard to refuse when AAA faced big bills, and the usual heavy advertising from household name corporations had tapered off in January and February.<br>So the ads, which he described as mild, went up in late February. ?I could fill this search engine up with porn ads and be a wealthy man, but I don't want the Government to make an example of me,? he said.<br>Mr Ashton, whose background includes stints as a journalist on suburban newspapers, said users had to be listened to. The Net was like a newspaper and feedback was invaluable in evaluating audience type.<br>?We are mindful of the loyal following Matilda has,? he said. ?Reaction on putting up the banners was quick and hostile.?<br>Carrying the newspaper analogy a step further, Mr Ashton explained that the ad space was booked as it would have been in the adult classified section of a paper.<br>But the user backlash showed it was obvious that ?no newspaper would put those ads on the front page?. Many of the 10,000 e-mails displayed at AAA's Messageboard appear to be from parents, some of whom said Matilda had been recommended as a top search engine by an encyclopedia.<br>Arguments for soft-porn advertising are very few, and appear to come mainly from the US.<br>Typical of messages opposed to the advertising are these:<br>?Please don't cheapen Matilda with sex sites or ads.<br>?Children also use your site therefore you have to be responsible.<br>?Matilda should not display sex/adult banners on site. As a search engine, you may be visited by children whose parents assume that a searchable site will limit the possible exposure of this type of material to their children.<br>?It needs to be banned. Yes, kids should be supervised at all times, but let's face it, getting into a porno site is the furthest thing from my mind but still I have done it accidentally.<br>?The answer is so obvious that to ask the question (whether soft-porn banners should be run) is ridiculous! The answer is of course not.<br>?Don't cheapen your great Web site by displaying porno banners. Forget all this moral stuff about censorship in the world. Just stop and think about how your trade would drop off. You have a good clientele right now. You're better off to just keep it that way.<br>?Adult content has its place on the Internet just like any other subject . . . but it does not need to be advertised on a major search engine like AAA Matilda.<br>Mr Ashton said that AAA Matilda was a 100 per cent Australian-owned and built search engine based in Sydney. It was developed originally by students at Charles Sturt University's Bathurst campus.<br>It competed favourably with much bigger US engines on their home turf and traffic averaged 50 million accesses a year, according to figures on AAA's server. ?It does pay for itself and runs at a profit,? Mr Ashton said.<br>AAA Matilda is at: www.aaa.com.au<br>User feedback on the porn-site banners is at:<br>www.aaa.com.au/matilda/feedback/sexsites/<br></font></p>
