            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>The Phantom (PG)<br>Billy Zane, Treat Williams, Kristy Swanson, Catherine Zeta Jones<br>Directed by Simon Wincer<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>THE Phantom has the strength of 10 tigers and is rough with roughnecks, according to the Old Jungle Sayings of Lee Falk's comic strips. He displays these traits beautifully in this holiday season film, but also shows a new dimension to his character.<br>Billy Zane's portrayal of the Ghost Who Walks is of an amusing, intelligent, confident but naive-with-women superhero.<br>It certainly makes Simon Wincer's dashing little bit of matinee entertainment memorable, adding charm and wit to what is really no more than a straight and very simple action adventure.<br>The Phantom was the first superhero of the century, created 60 years ago for comic books and newspaper strips. Unlike Superman he does not have superhuman powers, and unlike Batman he does not have an arsenal of technology and a silly sidekick.<br>He relies on strength, both physical and moral, in his never-ending battle against bad guys (easy to tell in this film because they all have big hats and are unshaven).<br>And he has spawned a cult following, particularly in Australia and Sweden.<br>However, the Phantom purist need not worry that this film will endanger the hero's credibility. It remains faithful to the ethos and content of the comics, and actually adds to the Phantom's mystique.<br>The film even begins like a Phantom comic strip or book episode with the words ?For those who came in late?, and the recounting of how the first Phantom saw his father killed by pirates, was washed ashore on Bengalla and swore on a mysterious skull to avenge dad's death.<br>As Zane's Phantom wrestles with adversity he is confronted several times by the ghost of his dad (crustily played by Patrick McGoohan) who reminds him he must find a bride and secure the Phantom line.<br>The simple plot of the film concerns the Phantom's battle to stop meglomaniac businessman Xander Drax (over the top portrayal by Treat Williams) getting three skulls with super powers - they could be used for good or evil.<br>This struggle brings him into contact with feisty newspaper heiress Diana Palmer (neatly played by Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Kristy Swanson).<br>Diana was the old girlfriend of Phantom's alter ego Kit Walker in college days, and although she is as sharp as a pin, it takes her most of the film to work out his identity.<br>This Lois Lane-type thickness has to be allowed for in superhero films. If you don't play along with the thin premise then you can never enjoy the unfolding action, of which The Phantom has lashings.<br>There is a fantastic escape from a crashing plane as Phantom and Diana leap on to Hero the horse's back at about 200kmh; there is a one-armed escape from a rolling truck on a rickety, collapsing rope bridge, and even a breathtaking tow behind a mini-submarine.<br>Amid the action is some gentle humour and glorious scenery and photography in both the jungle and the recreated streets of 1930s New York.<br>Plus there is a gorgeous villainess with a soft centre (Sala played by TV's Darling Buds of May Catherine Zeta Jones).<br>The Phantom is good, clean fun and should be a hit, particularly with children (it's not too violent).<br>You can't help but like The Phantom; anyone with the courage to wear those purple tights deserves admiration.<br></font></p>
