            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHICH genius at Channel 7 decided to wire the Ansett Cup umpires for sound so viewers could hear their breathless shouting?<br>Wired officials did not work for Super League last year, nor do they work for rugby union's Super 12.<br>Whether they be referees or umpires, the men in white have a predictable and less than entertaining patter. It goes: ?Get back, get back ... play on, play on ... ? and not much else that is easily heard.<br>It rarely tells us why certain decisions are made. None is a Churchillian orator able to declaim at length and with humour about rule so and so, and the exact reasons why a mark was not paid or why a tiggy-touchwood tackle was adjudged too high when it had no obvious detrimental effect on the ball-carrier.<br>Many viewers are not particularly interested in what the umpires have to say anyway. They are nearly always wrong aren't they?<br>Far better then to wire the fans. There might at least be some interesting and provocative - with expletives deleted of course - streams of consciousness about matches.<br>Can you imagine a certified ratbag like Ewen McCormick, of the Nike ads, hooked up? Now I know he is an actor and the ads are done in fun, but there are people just like McCormick in every crowd.<br>What a treat it would be to hear further in-depth analysis of the Gavin Wanganeen quads playing for Port Adelaide. If you have not seen it already, McCormick's theory is that Wanganeen is actually identical quads called Bruce, Wayne, Kevin and Barry.<br>Each plays a quarter, thus explaining the Port skipper's freshness and ability from beginning to end.<br>Or why not find someone like Chris Haywood, the actor who plays the boofheaded weekend sportsman in the Dunlop ads?<br>He ?coaches? Mark Philippoussis to serve more gently in tennis so that his opponent can return the ball. And he gives Craig Parry lessons in how to drive shorter off the tee in golf so he does not have as far to walk to his ball.<br>The world has plenty of Haywoods, too. In fact people who enjoy sport on TV are often those who played some in their younger days. And as time passes, they believe they were much better than they probably were.<br>The evidence for this is in just about every living room and pub during any competition ... possibly barring the luge.<br>We could all bat more sensibly than Matthew Elliott, know that Michael Gardiner was free in space in the forward pocket, could have stopped Jonah Lomu easily (they can't run without legs), and would certainly, unlike Pat Rafter, have let the ball drift out.<br>And we all know infinitely more than Eddie McGuire or Bruce McAvaney, can do Richie Benaud's voice better than him, and shout louder than either Sandy Roberts or Bill Lawry.<br>Get that microphone off the umps and into the hands of the experts ... us.<br></font></p>
