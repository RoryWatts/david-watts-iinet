            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WOMEN<br>She Said<br>www.shesaid.com.au<br>SHE SAID carries a graphic that proclaims it ?Australia's premier women's site?. This is a big call considering it was launched less than a fortnight ago.<br>But it shows a lot of promise. The design is simple and slick without flashy add-ons and it is easily navigated. The content looks promising.<br>Categories aiming to cater to the modern online woman include Money Sense, Retail Therapy, Working Life and Body and Soul. It doesn't take itself too seriously either with the Body and Soul section featuring quirky articles on the benefits of the indoor girl club and how to boost activity levels by weight-losing activities such as blow-drying hair.<br>She Said's creators, Sharon Smith and Monique Harris, say cyberspace has been a male domain too long.<br>?Women use the Internet as a tool to find specific answers and information. She Said will provide practical solutions and support for women who are looking for the most time-efficient method to obtain the facts,? they say.<br>HUNGER<br>World Food Program - the Hunger Site<br>www.hungersite.com<br>BY SIMPLY clicking an icon at this site, Web users can contribute to the United Nations' World Food Program.<br>Sponsors at the site have guaranteed to subsidise payments for rice, wheat, maize and other staple foods to hungry people around the world for every hit on the icon.<br>One hit is said to pay for half a cup of badly needed food. The site claims to be responsible for donations of 100 tonnes of food a week.<br>FUN<br>The Chaser<br>www.chaser.com.au<br>FROM the sublime to the ridiculous ... at this time of year, it becomes difficult to take too much too seriously. The Chaser, with a humorous mix of satire and mirth as it lampoons the news of the day, treats life very lightly.<br>Its highlight is undoubtedly PackerWatch where users enter the details of their annual salary to find out just how little time it takes Kerry Packer to earn the same amount.<br>Try $50,000, the Government's cut-off point for the East Timor levy, and you'll see that Mr Packer can earn that in less than half an hour.<br>FLUFF<br>Linternet<br>casimir.jon.tripod.com/linternet.html<br>IT IS always amazing and amusing to find what amuses other people. Sydney journalist Jon Casimir has a thing about belly button fluff.<br>One English visitor has described the site as recommended ?to all discerning Web users?.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
