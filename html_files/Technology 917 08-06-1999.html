            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">OPPONENTS of the Federal Government's Internet regulation regime have been experimenting with some censorship of their own.<br>In the past week, several have joined a protest known as the Great Gov.au Blockade. This allows servers to detect whether requests for Web pages come from users in the gov.au domain, that is anyone who is accessing the Net from a government address.<br>Government workers are redirected to censorship protest pages and denied access to the URL they requested.<br>One Perth user told The West Australian last week he had detected dozens of hits from Parliament House in Canberra. Many users requesting a page he had drawn up on censorship protest rallies had aph.gov.au as part of their addresses.<br>They were barred access to the rally page and taken to a special page outlining the faults of Net censorship legislation passed by the Senate a fortnight ago.<br>The Perth user explained that a CGI (common gateway interface) script inserted at the rally address checked where requests came from. Anyone without gov.au in their addresses was shown the rally page. Gov.au users were taken elsewhere in an operation that users would not detect because it consumed little extra time.<br>An outspoken critic of the censorship legislation, Heath Gibson of Newcastle, says at a FAQ about the blockade that it is a symbolic protest.<br>?The point of this project is for individual Net users to deny their content to certain people,? he says. ?It is analogous to refusing to speak to someone you disagree with until they have listened to your opinion. The aim of the blockade is to give individual Net users a way to protest against the legislation without actually having to remove their Web content altogether.?<br>HELP DESK<br>Great Gov.au Blockade: www.cmetech.com.au/<br>minister-for-ignorance-technology.html<br>Alsto talks to Wired News: www.wired.com/news/print<br>-version/politics/story/20013.html?wnpg<br></font></p>
