            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE war of the World Wide Web browsers started in earnest yesterday.<br>Netscape released Navigator 3.0 exactly one week after Microsoft unleashed Internet Explorer 3.0 amid cyberbabble and publicity not seen since Windows95 made its debut a year ago.<br>Each software giant took great pains to debunk the claims of the opponent's browser at corporate Web sites.<br>Netscape ran six pages to say that MS Explorer was slower, clumsier, harder to download, lacking features and not usable on most platforms.<br>Microsoft hit back with its own statistics showing it could be as fast, its features had ?richer architecture? and Explorer was as easy to download as Netscape.<br>It had to admit that Explorer could be used only with Windows95 and NT, though baulked at Netscape's claim that Navigator could be used on 16 computer operating systems. Eleven of those were Unix-based and they accounted for just one per cent of browser users.<br>Microsoft also made great play of the number of Explorer downloads in the first week of release, saying demand had far outstripped capacity at its server sites because of the browser's popularity.<br>More than 32,000 users downloaded Explorer in the first six hours of its release, Microsoft said.<br>?We anticipated great customer interest in Explorer, but the demand has been overwhelming,? Microsoft's vice-president of Internet tools, Brad Silverberg, said.<br>Microsoft is offering free subscriptions to several Web sites, including the Wall Street Journal, for those who register Explorer. It is also offering a glow-in-the-dark T-shirt.<br>The indisputable fact before the war began is that Netscape dominates the browser market like few products in either the real or virtual worlds.<br>International Data Corporation's global Internet user survey in July showed 87.6 per cent of surfers used Netscape compared with 2.6 per cent for Explorer.<br>Microsoft does not deny Netscape's domination, but presents figures at its site showing Explorer has been eroding Navigator's share since beta versions were released in May.<br>The Browserwatch survey shows Navigator with 76.7 per cent of users in July, but 73.8 per cent earlier this month. Explorer went from 13.1 per cent to 15.3 per cent in the same time.<br>A survey by Interse shows a more dramatic drop by Netscape - 83.2 per cent in May to 72.6 in July. Explorer jumped from 7 per cent to 15.8 in the same time.<br>Explorer seems ready to erode Netscape's market share more significantly given that major US online service providers America Online and Compuserve have adopted it as their standard browser. Demon Internet, UUnet Pipex and BT in Britain have done the same thing.<br></font></p>
