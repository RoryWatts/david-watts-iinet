            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU can tell that the football season proper has started ... no one is happy.<br>Mick Malthouse was disgruntled at the way his Eagles midfielders went flat. Damian Drum was upset that the Dockers did not really show up until after quarter time.<br>Fremantle and West Coast supporters in Melbourne were fuming that the best derby yet was not shown on Channel 7 there, even though Bruce McAvaney told Sportsworld viewers on Sunday morning that it would be.<br>He also said Sydney v Port Adelaide would be shown ?right around the country?. Perth must have moved.<br>St Kilda fans had agonised that Seven in Melbourne would show only the second half of its match against Brisbane on Saturday night, preferring Adelaide v the Bulldogs. By half-time, Saints supporters were probably pleased.<br>Collingwood types were not impressed that Seven chose to ignore the Pies-Hawthorn clash. There was even talk of a conspiracy because Collingwood president Eddie McGuire is a Channel 9 man.<br>Carlton president John Elliott moaned that the AFL had done little to promote Thursday's season opener against Essendon.<br>Some grievances were justified; some were just strange, but the unhappiest notes came before the first ball was bounced.<br>Nicky Winmar was justifiably upset that Sam Newman on Nine's Footy Show had impersonated him by putting on black face make-up.<br>Its host, the many-hatted McGuire, did not look too thrilled with Newman's performance either. On Sunday, he apologised for it but scoffed at suggestions Newman would be suspended.<br>Newman's act spoiled what up to that late moment had been a top show. In football parlance, Nine's team had been hard at the ball.<br>The rare Wednesday night outing pitted the Footy Show against the Jason Dunstall-hosted Live and Kicking on Seven. It was barely a contest as the Nine team threw in top interviews and plenty of analysis against Seven's dancing girls and impersonators (although Matthew Burton's Lurch was not to be missed).<br>Live and Kicking ironically had Russell Morris singing the Real Thing while the Footy Show was doing the real thing and concentrating on the football.<br>Where Seven had James Hird talking about Len Thompson selling his Brownlow, Nine was questioning the man himself.<br>McGuire's highwire act, balancing the presidency against journalism, will be put to the test this season. On what basis can we judge his interviews with Elliott and Melbourne president Joe Gutnick?<br>Was McGuire an objective journalist or a fellow president with inside knowledge?<br>The same goes for Terry Wallace on Seven's Talking Footy. How much will he really be able to contribute as a fulltime coach? Will his Bulldogs escape the scrutiny that other clubs will bear?<br>Stay tuned.<br></font></p>
