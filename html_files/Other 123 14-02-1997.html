            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AH, Valentine's Day; all the little Snookums, Sugar Bottoms and Floppy Drawers are having a lovely time today. It's a bit sickening when romance becomes bad poetry, melting chocolates and furtive card-writing.<br>It need not be that way. Real love comes only with real courting, the noble and ancient art of wooing for the purposes of living happily ever after and having kiddies.<br>What follows is from a chap's point of view, because that is my experience, but non-chaps may agree with the opinions - then again they may not (non-chaps are like that, as we shall learn).<br>The courting bug first grabs a chap's hormones at the age of 14 or 15 and coincides neatly with the appearance of a gawky Adam's apple, pimples, halitosis, gangliness, unsure voice and other nasties.<br>So, when a 14 or 15-year-old chap wants to court - say at a school dance - some pimples burst, his tongue gets tied, he feels sick, the first dandruff appears and his feet won't move.<br>This enables a young chap to fall in the direction of his heart's desire and say courtly things like: ?Ywannadanceorwot??<br>There is no accepted answer, nor is there a general protocol here. Girls, being young women in waiting, will either accept coyly, laugh at the goofy guy, or both, or just ignore him.<br>This is a good lesson. It will happen for the rest of a chap's life. Women will always hold sway when he is in the courting mood.<br>A female friend of mine says she knows why.<br>?Men are all idiots as far as women are concerned,? she says. ?They always think they're in love, don't know what to do or what to say. They just want women.?<br>It has a lot to do with the Garden of Eden, where God told Adam he had good and bad news.<br>The good was that He had given Adam two new organs, one of them a brain. The bad was that He had allowed only enough blood to use the brain or the other organ at one time.<br>Given that background, it is then surprising to learn that chaps persevere. In their late teens-early 20s, they are most virile and therefore most vulnerable to the Garden of Eden lesson.<br>This is the courting ritual at this age: play footy on Saturday, grab a pizza, shower, change into fresh (i.e. unsmelly) T-shirt, jeans and new sneakers, go to pub.<br>AT THE pub, where desirable girls are dancing together, the chaps drink with their mates for a couple of hours.<br>Those emboldened enough will wander among the girls, choose their heart's desire and say something cool like: ?Owaboutit??<br>Older chaps, say in their mid to late-20s, learn the art of ?The Line?. Good lines never fail, say other chaps. Lines are a joke and will be treated just how we feel, say the girls.<br>No one has produced a better chat-up line than Shakespeare who allowed Romeo to woo Juliet with a classic.<br>Today your average Jason, Nathan, Shane or Matt should be able to charm the socks off a girl with: ?What light through yonder window breaks; It is the dawn and Juliet (but more probably Kylie or Narelle or Sky) is the Sun.?<br>Goose bumps city . . . but perhaps not. There's always:<br>?You have the most beautiful eyes?; ?Aren't you glad you're a blonde??; ?When you come back it'll be as a tigress?, or, ?Owaboutit??. They are all guaranteed to work .j.. every now and then. And equally they are all guaranteed to fail just as much.<br>And why do chaps, year after year, continue to chase and make fools of themselves?<br>One day they'll realise that the hot babe in the little black number will turn out to be a mother who jams her son's hat down over his ears or asks why didn't he go before he left home.<br>But they never learn ... thank goodness.<br></font></p>
