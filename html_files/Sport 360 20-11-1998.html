            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOME time today, if the Brisbane weather is kind, someone will break my reverie in front of the television to ask: ?Who's winning the cricket?? I will say, ?we are? and pray for no more interruptions, however friendly or well-intentioned.<br>When I was younger and more patient, I used to take my eyes off the screen and fix them on the questioner to explain at length . . . ?At this stage of the game, it's impossible to tell who's winning. England has just started bowling, the Australian openers look vulnerable, the wicket is two-paced and I'm sure the humidity is making benign-looking deliveries unplayable.<br>?In fact, it is often hard to say, even in the last hour, who's winning. The game is complicated. There's the weather, the conditions, the umpires.<br>?Moreover, many games are never actually won. They are drawn, like a stalemate in chess . . . ? Then the questioner would look dazed and say: ?Yeah, but who's winning??<br>I would look back at the screen to discover four wickets had fallen, the frightening fast bowler had been no-balled for throwing and a seagull had taken off with the bails.<br>It is hard work loving cricket. Many hours are spent watching what looks like the identical scene being repeated. The medium-pacer trundles (they never run or walk) in, rolls his arm over. The ball is on a good length just outside off-stump and the batsman lets it through untouched to the keeper.<br>And again, and again . . . for five days if you're lucky.<br>All this is endured in the hope of a few marvellous moments such as a Shane Warne delivery spinning a metre to clean bowl Mike Gatting or a Justin Langer back-foot drive hit so thunderously, it rockets into the boundary before the fieldsmen can move.<br>It is a game of raptures and time<br>wasting and marvellous trivia.<br>The other day I discovered on the Internet the answers to questions I've asked secretly for years (one does not admit lack of knowledge in cricket matters). Someone - the misguided fool - wanted to know how the fielding positions got such quaint names like point, gully, slips, and so on.<br>And someone, from India I think, was so tragically in love with the game that he claimed he knew, and served up these:<br>POINT: In the early days of cricket, point denoted a very close position. Its full name - the point of the bat - indicates that the fielder stood very near to the end of the striker's bat.<br>THIRD MAN: First appeared in the mid-19th century to describe a position to supplement the more established close off-side positions of point and short slip. The new man was thus the third man up.<br>SLIP: Originally the long stop, who ?is required to cover many slips from the bat?.<br>GULLY: Suggests the narrow channel between point and the slips.<br>COVER: Literally a fieldsman who covers for those closer in.<br>Now this man may be talking through his washing hat but those answers satisfy me . . . until something more intriguing and equally unsourced comes along.<br>After all, who wants the facts to stand in the way of a romantic game?<br>AFTER last week's column - an e-mail to Prince Charles - a reader told me to ?stick to your normal inanities rather than the pretentious twaddle published today?.<br>So I will. The prince received some fabulous presents for his 50th birthday last Saturday. He was promoted to two-star rank in all three military service branches: Major-General in the army, Rear-Admiral in the navy and Air Vice-Marshal in the air force.<br>The Times felt moved to Gilbert and Sullivan style verse:<br>Prince Charles he is the model of a modern Major-General. To his birthday he's invited the glitterati one and all.<br>And to give him brighter scrambled egg to wear upon his epaulette, His promotions are announced today in the London Gazette. For he's also made Rear-Admiral and Air Vice-Marshal too, Rising faster through the Services than lesser men can ever do.<br>Inane enough for you?<br></font></p>
