            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE were two vastly different forms of entertainment available for non-Melrose Place addicts on Tuesday night.<br>First was Peter Costello fleecing the wallets of his Liberal Party's natural constituency - the well-heeled - in the Federal Budget.<br>Second, and eminently more amusing, was Australia's first soap opera on the Internet. The Net soapie goes by the name of Friday's Beach and throws together the usual bunch of 15, 16 and 17-year-old head cases at a suitably Australian venue called Cockatoo Beach in Sydney.<br>It sounds like it is crying out to be on the box rather than the personal computer, particularly when you hear the plot line.<br>To quote the precis given on the Internet page featuring Friday's Beach (one run by the mega computer giant Microsoft of Seattle): ?Meet Mia, Eliza, Jeremy, Julian and Mike and get to know them like no other soap opera characters. Friday's Beach brings real video and audio to the Net.<br>?Each month you'll also be able to chat live with the characters on MSN (Microsoft Network) Chat.? Will Mia run away from home and become a model? What's Mike getting hooked on??<br>It goes on. But even if this all sounds trite or tawdry, it is a significant change in the way entertainment is moving.<br>The Internet is a rapidly growing phenomenon, said to be used by 40 million people worldwide, whose socio-economic profile is becoming closer to the average Western country's population.<br>Sounds like perfect soap opera fodder.<br>An Internet user also does not have to rely on a programmer calling all the shots, that is, sitting on the couch staring open-jawed at Melissa George in Home and Away.<br>Even though Net technology is in its crystal radio stage, it is possible to play sounds and watch video shunted down the phone line from anywhere in the world.<br>Friday's Beach does not promise the revolutionary sort of entertainment that would allow computer users to intervene in the story, write their own plot line and reshape a drama into a comedy, say. That sort of exercise can be carried out using usually expensive management training software programs on CD.<br>But in allowing ?viewers? to use the Net to talk to the cast or e-mail them and also click on key items in the plot like a diary or set of love poems, it allows a broader sense of the unfolding soapie.<br>No longer is there a need to turn on the TV at 7pm precisely and put up with clutches of ads just as the action warms up. You can ?watch? Friday's Beach whenever you like and for how long you like.<br>Friday's Beach will update each week. An Internet user coming to the page is given the choice of going through the latest episode, catching up on the last one, reading profiles about the cast and sending them e-mails, or once a month chatting to them over the Net.<br>Each episode is broken into scenes which are very short summaries of the action. In each scene is a highlighted word and image which when clicked on takes the user to a scene behind the scene.<br>In this week's first episode one such highlight if you like is to read the daily training schedule of Mike, a sort of resident knucklehead.<br>He does 200 push-ups, 200 chin-ups and 200 sit-ups before breakfast and for little lunch (they're all at school like any good Australian soapie) he eats a loaf of bread.<br>A little more exotic are the diaries of the leading girls - Mia the stunner and Eliza the thinker.<br>You can read the scenes in whatever order you like or copy a video clip to your computer showing some highlights. This exercise takes about 40 minutes for one minute of viewing, so it is a little frustrating but does allow you to see the cast in action.<br>Friday's Beach is written by soap opera veteran Helen Townsend, who has written for Neighbours among others. It is produced by a Sydney company called Tech Talk which hopes the show will capture teenage attention around the world.<br>Net address: http://www.msn.com.au/FridaysBeach/<br></font></p>
