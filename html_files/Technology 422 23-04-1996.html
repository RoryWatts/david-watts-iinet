            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HUNDREDS of educational, artistic and worthy World Wide Web sites - including the Bible - would be outlawed under the NSW Government's planned tough Internet censorship law, according to Electronic Frontiers Australia.<br>EFA, a voluntary organisation dedicated to the promotion of electronic technology, has released a list of sites it claims are threatened by the legislation proposed by NSW Attorney-General Jeff Shaw at the beginning of April.<br>The sites range from online museums displaying Renaissance art such as Boticelli's Birth of Venus, to extracts of books such as Huckleberry Finn, the King James version of the Bible, medical tracts on breast cancer and support groups for homosexual organisations.<br>EFA does not list reasons why the sites would face censure, but the planned legislation is promoted by the NSW Government as the toughest in Australia.<br>Under the legislation it will be an offence to ?transmit, advertise, permit access to and retrieval of? offensive material on online services, of which the Internet with perhaps 300,000 NSW users is chief.<br>Offensive material is defined as anything that would be refused classification or restricted to adults and includes material that would be rated MA, unsuitable for anyone under 15.<br>Penalties would be up to a year in jail or $10,000 fine for individuals or $25,000 for corporations.<br>The public backlash has been strong and sustained with plans for a rally in Sydney on May 27 well advanced.<br>Critics of the proposals call them draconian and say they would limit the Internet to providing material fit only for 14-year-olds.<br>The censorship moves fly in the face of a Federal Government report released last week which says that a greater risk is that concerns about the Net could deny thousands of children the chance to participate in great learning opportunities.<br>Teachers interviewed for the study said that videos and magazines posed a greater threat than the Net.<br>Angus Kidman, commentator for Australian PC magazine, said that the broad definition of online services by Mr Shaw would drag Telstra's public telephone system in. Telstra would become a major corporate criminal because it would not be able to stop R or X-rated private conversations.<br>The legislation would also make it illegal to send a message via e-mail that would be legal in an envelope, or to transmit the scripts of Academy-award winning films Braveheart and Dead Man Walking because they are rated MA.<br>E-mail letters to the Net edition of the Sydney Morning Herald were about 80 to 20 against Mr Shaw's plans and most were vigorously opposed.<br>The major shortcoming seen in the legislation, outside of its severe limitations on a mainly adult medium, was the futility of trying to police a rapidly growing global resource.<br>Many correspondents said NSW would need armies of Net police to enforce the legislation. And they described one-off attempts by States to crack down on Net pornography as futile without global agreement.<br>URL: http://www.efa.org.au<br></font></p>
