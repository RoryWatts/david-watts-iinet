            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LAST year I wrote an awful lot about the difference between the sexes, basically the things that set blokes apart from sheilas. I vowed to myself over the New Year that I would look at a wider range of topics in 1998.<br>But I lied. So this week you are going to get a list of the things that make being a bloke worthwhile. So there.<br>Two things inspired me to break the vow. One happened during a recent holiday on Rottnest.<br>A mate had taken his boys there a couple of days before their GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum . . . see they're back too) could get away from Perth. The bloke and his boys joined up in a cottage with another bloke and his boys, the perfect scenario for a bit of male bonding.<br>What they achieved, apart from the ability to dodge all the discarded items of clothing and food on the floor, came to light just after the GYM arrived.<br>She was dozing, half awake, when one of her boys started shouting to some friends at a nearby cottage. To her horror, this is what she heard her son say:<br>?Hey mate, guess what we did last night? We had a farting competition and I came third.?<br>Voice of mate: ?Who won??<br>Boy: ?My dad.?<br>The second inspiration was the first episode of the alleged new blockbuster sitcom on Channel 9 on Monday, Veronica's Closet. This stars the entirely gorgeous and cuddly Kirstie Alley as the head of a fashion empire. Unfortunately she is about twice the girl she was when she was a glamorous model, and has a cheating, no-good bloke of a husband, who, after committing adultery, tries to lure her back by singing some awful love ballad.<br>Anyway, Veronica's answer to these mini-tragedies is to gorge on junk food, then to diet, then to binge, then to diet etc etc . . . the never-ending cycle of despair.<br>The show, like so much junk entertainment from the US and that includes the film Titanic, centres on stereotyping. If a woman is not a thin, blonde bimbo in a tight dress, she has to stuff her face instead of having sex.<br>For example, not one of the heartless but stunning bitches in Melrose Place ever resorts to a doughnut or milkshake. They are too busy scheming and plotting their way into the wrong man's bed.<br>But the Veronicas of this world, disguised in flowing kaftans that hide their ample curves, are forced into a fixation about weight. Thin equals sex; fat equals junk food . . . for women.<br>WHICH leads us to this little, edited (because there are some rude words around) list of the best things about being a bloke. This list originated on the Internet, like a growing number of modern phenomena like Bill Clinton's sex life (why do we need to know so much?). Here is the list:<br>1. Phone conversations are over in 30 seconds flat.<br>2. Movie nudity is virtually always female.<br>3. You know stuff about tanks.<br>4. A five-day holiday requires only one suitcase.<br>5. Queues to public toilets at major events are 80 per cent shorter.<br>6. Old friends don't give a fig whether you've lost or gained weight.<br>7. Your bottom is never a factor in job interviews.<br>8. You don't have to lug a bag of useless stuff around everywhere you go.<br>9. You can go to the toilet without a support group.<br>10. You can kill your own food.<br>11. You can be showered and ready to go in 10 minutes.<br>12. If someone forgets to invite you to something, he or she can still be your friend.<br>13. You can buy three pieces of underwear for $10.<br>14. If you're 34 and single, nobody notices.<br>15. Three pairs of shoes are more than enough.<br>FHOW about a little joke? This was told to me by my mate Bill from Daglish, who honestly is old enough to know better.<br>Q: What do you call a bear without ears?<br>A: A B.<br></font></p>
