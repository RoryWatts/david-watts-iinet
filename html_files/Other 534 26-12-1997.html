            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE clever ones started writing even before the ink had dried on last Friday's paper. They had tried my holiday music quiz and confidently answered most questions.<br>But when they looked at the answers I supplied, oh, the horror. I said the 1910 Fruitgum Company sang Yummy, Yummy, Yummy (and Chewy, Chewy). They knew it was Ohio Express.<br>And you know what? They were right. They spotted my deliberate error, the product of a mind addled by actually dancing to those two songs while wearing a floral shirt and flares, and in the company of girls in hot pink and lime green, whose dresses flashed brightly under the pulsating strobe lights.<br>How could we forget that the 1910 Fruitgum Company was responsible for the priceless Indian Giver (Indian Givuh, Indian Givuh, You took your love away from me); or 1,2,3 Red Light?<br>Anyway, on to this week's TV quiz, which begins with a theme song. Please fill in the missing lyrics:<br>1) Keep movin', __, __<br>Though they're __<br>Keep them __ movin', __.<br>Don't try to __ "em,<br>Just rope "em, __, and __ "em.<br>Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.<br>2) What was this the theme to?<br>3) Which Hollywood megastar cut his acting teeth here?<br>4) Name the star whose first big role was a child in The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters?<br>5) Pick the odd one out: Fury, Flicka, Trigger, Tonto.<br>6) Who played the Lone Ranger?<br>7) The Cisco Kid's sidekick was who?<br>8) In later episodes of the Flintstones, Fred was often accompanied by an irritating little green man. Name him.<br>9) Who were George Jetson's children?<br>10) Name George's boss and his boss' business rival.<br>11) Who was Fred Flintstone's boss?<br>12) Odd one out time again: Natasha Stott-Despoja, Kate Fischer, Mikey Robbins, Noel Ferrier.<br>13) Who played the first Doctor Who?<br>14) What was the favourite expression of the Daleks?<br>15) Loretta Swit played Hot Lips Houlihan in the TV series of M*A*S*H. Who played her in the movie?<br>16) Hum a few bars of the theme tune.<br>17) Speaking of themes, fill in the missing words:<br>Where Indian __ are colourful __<br>And nobody takes a __<br>Where paleface and __<br>Both turn __<br>18) What was that the theme for?<br>19) How come Wilton never ran off with Wrangler Jane?<br>20) The bugler was Trooper who?<br>21) Which town did Agarn come from?<br>22) What model car did the detectives drive in the first episodes of Homicide?<br>23) Complete the following: Take him to __ Street and book him;<br>24) Book him __<br>25) You __ old moo.<br>26) Which character was responsible for the saying in Q25?<br>27) In real life, the man who played the ?scouse git? boyfriend of his daughter has a fairly famous daughter himself. Why, pray tell?<br>28) Which debonair Pom do you associate with Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King?<br>29) Who played those three characters?<br>30) In Red Dwarf last Monday, who shot JFK?<br>ANSWERS: 1) movin', movin', disapprovin', dogies, Rawhide, understand, throw, brand 2) Rawhide 3) Clint Eastwood (as Rowdy Yates), 4) Kurt Russell 5) Tonto (the others are horses) 6) Clayton Moore 7) Pancho 8) Gazoo (or the Great Gazoo) 9) Elroy and Judy 10) Mr Spaceley, Mr Cogswell (Spaceley's Sprockets and Cogswell's Cogs) 11) Mr Slate 12) Noel Ferrier (all have been on the ABC's Good News Week, but Ferrier is the only one who's passed away) 13) William Hartnell 14) Exterminate 15) Sally Kellerman 16) da, da da da da dum (Suicide is Painless) 17) fights, sights, lickin', redskin, chicken 18) F-Troop 19) He was a wimp 20) Hannibal Dobbs 21) Passaic, New Jersey 22) Studebaker 23) Russell (from Homicide) 24) Dano (from Hawaii-Five-O) 25) silly (Till Death Us Do Part) 26) Alf Garnett (played by Warren Mitchell) 27) She is Cherie Booth (dad was Anthony Booth), the wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair 28) John Steed 29) Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and Linda Thorson 30) JFK (you see it was a futuristic one brought back to put history right . . . oh it's all too bizarre).<br>Get your running shoes ready for sport trivia next week.<br></font></p>
