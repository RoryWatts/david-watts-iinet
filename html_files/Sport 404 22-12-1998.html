            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT lovers have just endured another episode of Some Weekends Do Ave "Em.<br>Unlike Some Mothers Do Ave "Em - the British show that inspired the title - Some Weekends etc is not a comedy.<br>In fact, this weekend it was dull and fairly deadly, unless you were English or South Australian.<br>The first act starred Mike Atherton and Graeme Hick in chilly Hobart, flaying the almost non-existent attack of a team that started life as the Australian XI, but rapidly became the Australian VIII.<br>Act II featured South Australian batsmen flaying (again) WA bowlers all over the WACA Ground with festive merriment on Saturday, then the wretched Redback bowlers keeping WA quiet on Sunday.<br>The alternative title for this act was Once Were Warriors.<br>Act III was one seen nearly every weekend in WA ... the non-appearance of a Perth Glory game on TV.<br>Unfortunately, this last act will be repeated nearly every weekend of the National Soccer League season unless the weight of public opinion convinces Channel 7 otherwise.<br>Seven passed NSL rights to the ABC when the commercial network gobbled up Australian soccer for the next 10 years back in August.<br>The ABC is committed to showing a minimum of two live games for each NSL club. The Glory has had one and the next is not due until the later part of the season, although the January 3 clash with Carlton looms as a possibility.<br>The ABC has national commitments and is doing its best to cover all teams.<br>The unhappy side-effect is that when the Glory plays as dramatic a game as Sunday's loss in Sydney, television viewers are stuck with South Melbourne v Northern Spirit.<br>There is a wide perception that Seven could make parochial West Australians happy by going for the Glory, either by showing extensive highlights or delayed telecasts.<br>A club spokesman said yesterday a petition signed by 10,000 supporters calling for a better deal had been handed to the station.<br>Even non-soccer types I have spoken to in the last week have said a dose of Glory on Sunday nights would be the perfect summer equivalent to the Eagles/Dockers/AFL coverage of winter.<br>On the Internet, a general sport discussion group has been talking about NSL coverage in general and the Glory coverage in particular.<br>Most people believed soccer would rate well and wondered aloud why it was not on Seven's timetable yet.<br>WA people usually identified themselves as Glory fans and made strong pleas for coverage of their team.<br>Looking at the TV guides, the only glory about the next episode of Some Weekends Do Ave "Em will probably come from the triumphs of Australia's Test team against the hapless England ... again.<br></font></p>
