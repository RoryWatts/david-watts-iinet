            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH people can now read Monica Lewinsky's book on their computer screens while munching on a pizza they ordered over the Internet.<br>And the only time they have to leave the screen is to let the pizza delivery boy in.<br>Although it is still easy - though sometimes frustrating - to order pizza by phone, and preferable to read a book with real paper pages so you can curl up with Monica in bed, so to speak; that is not the point.<br>The Internet is still in its infancy as a provider of goods and services, and, like the talking dog, it is not what is said, but that it can be done at all.<br>Take Ms Lewinsky for instance. Her tales of romps with US President Bill Clinton in the book Monica's Story, written by Andrew Morton, went on sale in Australia in hardcover yesterday and in the US last week.<br>But the giant American firm, Barnes and Noble, has created publishing history by also offering the whole book in digital form for download to users' computers.<br>Entire books have been able to be downloaded for some time. Followers of Vanity Fair on the ABC have been able to read William Makepeace Thackeray's words on their screen while watching the TV series, for example.<br>But this is the first time a new release, and a book not out of copyright, has been made available.<br>Those who really need a dose of Monica loves Bill can simply click on the right button at www.barnesandnoble.com and every precious word will flow to their hard drives. There is no waiting for international courier and no shipping fee. Monica's Story is very cheap - about $24 - in this digital form, known as RocketFormat.<br>Users who want the digital book enter their credit card details, wait for the transaction to be approved, and are then directed to a download site.<br>If Monica's Story still leaves people famished, then nourishment of a more fundamental nature is also available to Perth Net users.<br>They can order pizzas online. Technology has not rocketed so far ahead that a family-size supreme will fly down the phone line and come out via the modem. Tomato paste and pepperoni tend to stick to surfaces anyway.<br>But an e-mail order through the PizzaNow Web site will get a pizza to the front door the same way as a conventional order by phone.<br>PizzaNow is the brainchild of WA online publisher Brian Gow.<br>He said he first saw the potential early last year, but to his amazement could find no serious sites offering such a service.<br>He formed a joint enterprise with NSW Internet services firm AusWeb with the aim of providing online pizza-ordering throughout Australia and New Zealand.<br>Fifteen Perth parlours have signed with PizzaNow and eight of them are connected and able to take orders. Depending on how wired the parlours are, they either receive orders by e-mail or a fax directed by PizzaNow. Confirmation of orders is done by return e-mail.<br>Mr Gow says the process takes only a minute or two and there is no waiting in a phone queue.<br>Hungry surfers have to register at PizzaNow before any ordering can be done. Nearly all the information they have to provide - address, phone number, nearest intersection -is identical to that given during a phone call.<br>The only additions the Net causes are user name and password.<br>Once registered, a surfer can find their nearest, or most desirable, connected parlour and browse through its menu.<br>Menu choices are clicked and the e-mail flies off. The pizza and other goodies then come to the door and are paid for as normal.<br>PizzaNow has not covered all areas in Perth yet but the Web site allows customers to suggest new parlours.<br>According to Mr Gow: ?It's very early days. Popular parlours like Chelsea Pizza in Nedlands and Uncle Gino's in Scarborough have only just started to receive orders.?<br>But he says the Net is no longer a niche market to be ignored. It was going to have a profound impact on average family life in the future and PizzaNow was just a tiny example of what could be expected.<br>Monica's Story can be downloaded from: www.barnesandnoble.com<br>PizzaNow is at: www.pizzanow.com.au<br>You can find links to online books and sellers at: www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/index1.html<br></font></p>
