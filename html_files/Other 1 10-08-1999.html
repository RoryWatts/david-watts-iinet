            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I TRIED to track down Spike Milligan's e-mail address last week. It was a fruitless search.<br>To cut a long story short, I had received a birthday card signed by the great comedian and wanted to thank him from the heart of my bottom (as he might put it) via my favoured means of communication.<br>Despite finding a few Web sites devoted to Milligan and a few more dedicated to the Goons, there was no sign of an e-mail address.<br>The best bet appears to be to write to the Goon Appreciation Society of Australia, or the Goon Preservation Society in the UK - both of which have Web sites - and ask if they have his snail mail address.<br>The Net might be a huge communication tool, but revered figures are still not easily contactable. Dave Barry, the American columnist and humorist with a big following, has produced a very funny site to announce his candidacy for the 2000 presidential election.<br>But, obviously wary of receiving buckets of fan mail which would tie him to the screen forever, he has decided to leave e-mail in the hands of his newspaper, the Miami Herald, where presumably an army of lackeys will filter out the weirdos.<br>Unlike Milligan, Barry has his own cyber presence. Milligan's are all made by adoring fans. Supermodel Cindy Crawford is another of the rich and famous who has an official site.<br>But again, you have to leap a virtual wall to get to the gorgeous one. Surfers can join Crawford's Cindy.com for about $50 and be amazed by her musings or spellbound by pictures of her not released to non-members. But, wouldn't you know it, no e-mail contact.<br>It is possible to establish e-mail contact with less stellar celebrities. Essendon glamour boy Matthew Lloyd is one who does get to grips with e-mail every week. He runs a question and answer column at the Melbourne Age's Footy 99 site where he responds to e-mails such as this: ?Is James Hird aware that he is a gay icon??<br>A bigger fish from the world of sport is American-based, Queensland golfer Greg Norman. Last week he flew into cyberspace with his own site, Shark.com, all tastefully set with pictures of the glam lifestyle. And he launched the site in a modern and even nerdy way, via an online press conference.<br>During the conference he denied he was doing a John Laws by using Shark.com to sell editorials to the highest bidder. But, according to Australian PC magazine's Newswire, the Laws quote and others were omitted from an official transcript of the conference provided to journalists.<br>Newswire, however, was able to log the conference and get a full transcript because it took place on a public Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server.<br>THE conference was a bit chaotic, as IRC and chat forums often are. Newswire said about 20 journalists were allowed to fire constant questions at Norman, who could only respond to about one in five. Some doubted that the chat participant was the real Greg Norman, and at one point someone claiming to be his son entered the chat room, adding to the confusion.<br>Small wonder then that the Shark might be wary of direct e-mails.<br>The Net still provides we unknowns with great chances to become legends in our own lunchtimes. But the genuine articles seem happy to maintain the status quo and be famous, yet at the same time unreachable.<br></font></p>
