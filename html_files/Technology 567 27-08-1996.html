            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NOTHING separates Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator in the war of the World Wide Web browsers.<br>But the important qualification is that they can be compared only on Windows95 or NT 4.0 platforms. The current version of Explorer 3.0 does not support the other 14 operating platforms that Navigator dominates as of this release.<br>Microsoft claims that five of those platforms are similar Unix-based ones which account for just one per cent of the browser market.<br>Maybe so. But among the others are Windows 3.1 and Macintosh which still are used by most Internet surfers.<br>The fact that Windows95 is now the standard for new PCs, and the Net population is still doubling every year, mean that Win95 - which will have the new Explorer bundled in it - will be the number one platform soon.<br>That means Explorer will be more than a serious threat to Navigator. It has the potential to beat it.<br>WestWeb loaded the new version 3.0 releases of both browsers last week and subjected them to three days of tests covering ease of installation, download speed, speed and stability in accessing Web pages, ability to handle Java, video and audio and mail and newsreading operation.<br>Both had as many good points as bad, but overall there was nothing to split them.<br>Net users looking for a definitive answer as to which browser to use with Windows95 are best advised to work out what their main requirements on the Web are, then seek the browser that handles them best.<br>For example, if the amount of hard disk space used by a program is a consideration, then Navigator would be the choice.<br>Netscape has bundled its applications into a 5.7Mb package which can be downloaded in 31 minutes compared with Microsoft's 7.8Mb that takes 43 minutes.<br>Installation of Navigator can be twice as fast and offers users the choice of where to put the software. Bookmark files, initialisation file and cache directory - where the products of a surfing session are stored automatically for quick retrieval - are also easy to find and manipulate.<br>EXPLORER, on the other hand, chooses where it will go, steals Netscape bookmarks for itself - handy if you knew what the file was called - and has four cache directories, hidden in the Windows folder, which WestWeb's ACDSee graphics viewer could not access.<br>The Netscape cache is set at a manageable 5Mb and can be cleared quickly, but the Explorer cache is set on a sliding scale that is accessed by going to options and advanced and clicking on a small folder dealing with temporary files.<br>That is, it is not readily apparent nor user friendly.<br>After three days using both browsers, WestWeb's test computer, with a 540Mb hard drive, was more than 20Mb worse off.<br>However, if speed of accessing pages, stability on the network and ease of operation are the priorities, Explorer heads Navigator.<br>Explorer takes an average 18 seconds to call to screen; Navigator takes 30 with much more hard disk activity.<br>Both access Web pages in similar times but WestWeb, with 8Mb of RAM, found Explorer far more stable and less hard-drive intensive.<br>The system crashed totally twice and threw up three fatal exception errors when Navigator was trying to access Web pages with Java enhancements.<br>It also threw a fatal error immediately after Navigator took 10 minutes to print four pages off the Web. Explorer did the same job in eight minutes with little hard disk activity. Offline, Explorer again outperformed Navigator in printing, though both accessed the hard drive for stored pages in about the same time.<br>Remarkably, Explorer mastered Java pages far better than Navigator, which brought the Sun's multimedia system to the Web in the first place.<br>BOTH were so similar in reproduction of Real Audio that it was impossible to split, but Navigator's inline video was a treat compared with Explorer's.<br>Navigator required only a mouse click to stop or start a seamless video while Explorer took nearly as long to finally play its video as it would actually to download and replay offline.<br>Mail and news are similarly easy to configure and friendly to use on both browsers, but Navigator's ability to display image files in the same document window as mail or new is superior to Explorer.<br>Explorer needs the user to click on a paper clip icon, then a file name before it decodes then displays an image file on the browser screen.<br>Overall there will be people who, because of their predilection to certain applications of the browser technology, prefer one over the other. But in the end, it may not matter.<br>Microsoft's dominance of the home PC market, and its intention to merge Internet Explorer with Windows Explorer might be all that matters in a year's time.<br>But today there is no clear winner.<br></font></p>
