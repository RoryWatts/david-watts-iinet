            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>For Roseanna (M)<br>Jean Reno, Mercedes Ruehl, Polly Walker<br>Directed by Paul Weiland<br>ALI MacGRAW is to blame. Since she boosted the sale of Kleenex by dying slowly in Love Story, few films have allowed their leading ladies to pass away without becoming healthier-looking and more beautiful as their terminal illnesses worsened.<br>Debra Winger got away with it twice in Terms of Endearment and Shadowlands.<br>Now Academy Award-winner Mercedes Ruehl (The Fisher King) gets sexier and chirpier in For Roseanna, a nice little piece of light romantic comedy which tugs gently at the heartstrings.<br>Ruehl is Roseanna and supposedly has severe heart problems. She has weeks, perhaps even days, to live and her dying wish is that she be buried next to her daughter in the graveyard of her small Italian village.<br>It sounds simple enough but there are only three plots left in the cemetery and rich landowner Capestro (Luigi Diberti) refuses to sell half an acre of his estate to the church to solve the problem.<br>Capestro's meanness is hard to understand - until the end. We find out early that he was once a cycling rival of Roseanna's loving husband Marcello (Jean Reno).<br>Roseanna's approaching death forces Marcello to take it on himself to try to stop all other deaths in the village - at least until Roseanna is at peace in her rightful place.<br>In the opening scenes Marcello directs traffic in the rustic laneways to prevent accidents. He is so inefficient he causes gridlock, allowing him to nag drivers into doing up their seatbelts.<br>He takes cigarettes out of the mouths of customers at his trattoria and refuses others wine so they do not drink and drive.<br>In this stressful quest for life, Marcello also visits the bedsides of the terminally ill in the local hospital where he tries to convince relatives not to turn off life-support machines because he is sure he has heard mumblings from coma-ridden bodies.<br>Though there are three plots in the cemetery there is only one plot in the film despite the appearance of a vengeful freed kidnapper looking for his ill-gotten gains and the burgeoning love affair between Roseanna's gorgeous sister Cecilia (Polly Walker) and Antonio (Mark Frankel), the nephew of the rich landowner.<br>While both sub-plots help sustain the sense of farce and fun, neither overwhelms the celebration of life curiously leaping from this story about death.<br>Death can be a taboo subject, but handled well, as it is in For Roseanna, it is no more than an affirmation that it is the only guarantee in life and has comic possibilities too.<br>The overall sense of light comedy is also helped by the setting in the beautiful Italian hillside village of Sermoneta. This is a true movie-world locale where the Italians all speak English with varying Italian accents - an easy place for a pleasant holiday.<br>In fact For Roseanna is a cosmopolitan feast with an Italian location designed to add a spice of fairytale colour that might be lacking in Belgium, for example.<br>Director Paul Weiland is British, Reno - throwing off the cold killer of The Professional - is French, and Ruehl is American. The fact that it is a European production financed by American money means the overblown and over-sentimental world of Hollywood is kept well away.<br>And just as well too. For Roseanna might not be much more than a pleasant diversion, but its bittersweet handling of death and the consequent good-hearted portrayal of life make it quite delightful.<br></font></p>
