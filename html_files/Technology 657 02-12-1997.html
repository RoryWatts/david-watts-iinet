            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Leeming man Bob Griffiths has one of the funniere-mail signatures around. It says: ?I want to die peacefully like my grandfather ? not screaming in terror like the passengers in his car.?It is a humorous symbol of what the Net has done for the retired 58-year-old ? virtually given him a new lease on life.<br>Mr Griffiths worked for 20 years as a paramedic for the St John Ambulance. In 1990 he had a serious accident which forced him into early retirement in 1993.<br>Struck for something meaningful to do, he bought a computer the next year and a few months later found himself hooked up to the then-new phenomenon of the Internet.<br>It might have been a stressful time with plenty of crashes and confusion but it seems Mr Griffith has weathered the techno-storm well. He is a great experimenter and seems to want to learn at the rate of an impressionable nine-year-old.Just recently, he unleashed his own multimedia tribute to Diana, the Princess of Wales. It is a clever piece of work in which an animated screen shows pictures of the princess surrounded by angels and clouds while a MIDI file plays the Elton John hit Candle in the Wind.Mr Griffiths used high-end package Adobe Photoshop to make GIF files of Diana, the angels and the background, then assembled them with the GIF Construction Set (Gifcon). He then put the whole thing into Email Magic to make a self-playing executable file that could be sent via e-mail to friends.He has also constructed a Win95 startup screen - again a Diana tribute - which he said was a more difficult assignment using Paint Shop Pro, a good hex editor ?and several pots of coffee?.From computer novice to multimedia creator in three years has been a thrilling journey.<br>?I needed a challenge that I could undertake to get me through this devastation (accident and retirement) as I had always been very physically active so now the little grey cells had to kick in and help me out,? Mr Griffiths said of his experiences. He felt it was time to face his biggest mental fear - computers - so bought one and taught himself.<br>?I can remember the excitement of finding out how to start up this monster, open File Manager, open one of those yellow rectangles and learning which file to click on to start a program. I really knew nothing about computers and I had nobody to show me.?<br>Despite the stimulation, he missed interacting with people and so he hooked up to the Net.?Wow. That opened up a whole new world,? he said. ?I taught myself HTML and JavaScript and my first page is Don't Take Life For Granted because I wanted to share my feelings with people.<br>'For everything I have learnt I have been helped by people all over the world by asking questions in the Usenet newsgroups and searching the Web. With the amount of information available on the Internet, there is nothing that anyone cannot learn.?<br></font></p>
