            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DAVID WATTS shows you where to start if you want to create a Web page.<br>It is as easy as HTML to make your own statement on the World Wide Web. HyperText Markup Language is the Web's lingua franca. It is pretty hard to establish a site without knowing it.The more people look at what is available out there, the more they appear to say ?I can do that?.<br>New sites are mushrooming. The Web is all about so-called vanity publishing where we ordinary citizens have a place to say what we feel, push our barrows, indulge ourselves.<br>Whether anyone cares enough to read it is another matter. Some knowledge of HTML and basic design help make a clearer statement by creating Web pages that don't make people rush for the exit.<br>The first thing to know is that HTML is not an arcane brand of programming best left to nerds. It is actually a logical if imperfect way of labelling parts of a document so they can be read by Web browsers. It can be learnt on the run in a few devoted hours.<br>The second thing is that you do not need crazy colours, frames, Java, blinking text, animations or fancy images to attract the buzzing bees in cyberspace.<br>The watchword - as it is with writing and design everywhere - is KISS, or Keep It Simple Stupid.<br>Many sites exist to help the wannabees in their quest to make a mark on the Web.<br>Two of the Net's biggest presences, cnet and Ziff-Davis Publishing, have set up well thought-out tutorials on HTML with links to many other sites that offer similar advice or good examples.<br>cnet has added to its daunting inventory of Web sites - search.com, news.com, browser.com and download.com - with builder.com, devoted entirely to those who want to build pages.It includes an awesome amount of information about every facet of Web publishing that may overload the novice but be a good resource for the confident user.<br>The build-up to builder.com is the much simpler Guide to Basic HTML, which waltzes the budding author through the basics.<br>It also discusses the tools needed. In essence a Web page can be made with just two: a simple document editor and an FTP program that enables you to send your pages to the Internet Service Provider.<br>In reality, a simple text editor is for the brave. Specialist HTML editing programs are everywhere and some, such as HomeSite and HotDog, are very good. Often it is easier to start with a ?codeless? program called a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor.<br>These enable users to create pages as they will appear. Text and image manipulation is relatively easy but the actual HTML code generated in the background can be messy.<br>The most common WYSIWYG editor is in Netscape Navigator Gold browsers. If you already have Gold as a browser, check its editing functions. Otherwise, download it as your new browser.<br>Another important tool is a graphics editor. This enables you to edit any images you want to add to a page. Paintshop Pro offers good shareware to do this for Windows users; Mac users can use GraphicConverter.<br>But back to the guides on the Net. Ziff Davis, or ZDNet, has a series of pages it calls an HTML tutorial. It is worth reading, not so much for the HTML guides which are done better elsewhere, but for the hints on design and links to well thought out sites.<br>In Australia, the best site dealing with Web authoring is the Lighthouse on the Web, run by David Walker.<br>He covers virtually everything that moves in site creation from where to find basic HTML tutorials, through the tools needed to how to tell the world about your site.<br>HELPDESK<br>FTP: File Transfer Protocol: the program that enables files to be transferred to and from computers on the Net.<br>How to be a Web site genius<br>ZDNet: www5.zdnet.com/<br>anchordesk/story/story_887.html<br>cnet HTML tips and tricks: www.cnet.com/Content/Features/<br>Howto/Htmltips/index.html?dd<br>Builder: www.cnet.com/Content/Builder/?dd<br>Lighthouse on the Web:<br>http://werple.net.au/ ~dwalker/<br></font></p>
