            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you ever doubted that computers and Internet technology are now an integral part of the modern world, look no further than the following slices of life in the 1990s.<br>The so-called cybercity of Springfield, 22km south-west of Brisbane, was opened to the public last Thursday after six years of development by builders, computer and telecommunications companies and the Queensland Government.<br>The city will eventually house 60,000 people in 14,000 homes, all of which will be wired by fibre optic cables and all of which will have Apple Macs connected to a community intranet.<br>This intranet is designed to allow communication between households, between businesses and residents, council and residents, emergency services and residents - and all permutations and combinations thereof. Matters from seeking a baby-sitter to paying rates to police alerts of break-ins can be dealt with electronically by the Mac that comes as a standard fitting in a new Springfield home.<br>The only down-side appears to be that the community has the same name as another one identified with the electronic age . . . the home town of Homer Simpson.<br>Last Friday the cnet Digital Dispatch reported the amazing breakthrough that IBM, in conjunction with Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California at Berkeley and Oxford College, had turned molecules of chloroform into the world's first quantum computer.<br>Using the technology behind the average MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, scientists were able to manipulate the two core elements of chloroform: hydrogen and carbon. This control allowed them to perform a database query at the molecular level.<br>A quantum computer is expected to perform calculations thousands and even millions of times faster than any computer we have today.<br>According to editors at cnet: ?In terms of a performance breakthrough, this is off the charts. This makes our current systems look like the stone tablet and the abacus.?<br>Last week in The Times was the astounding news that Eton College was about to have its own intranet as well as access to the Internet. Schools throughout the world have been embracing the Net as a valuable educational tool, so what is the big deal with Eton?<br>The school is home to 1300 boys, many of whom are the offspring of Britain's landed gentry, titans of business and playmates of the future King William.<br>Their school sits shoulder-to-shoulder with Windsor Castle in an area dotted by ancient and historic buildings, making the logistics of cabling 20th century networks a nightmare. Indeed, as The Times said: ?The battle of Waterloo may have been won on the playing fields of Eton, but the hurdles facing Andrew Reid, head of computer services, must sometimes seem almost as daunting.?<br>The move to the modern world is taking place in an environment where boys still wear stick-up collars, black tail-coats and pin-striped trousers. Etonians will be allowed to access the Net only under strict supervision, but they will be given greater freedom with e-mail.<br>Although the students are the sons of some of the world's wealthiest people, only about a quarter bring their own computers to school.<br>What is more, the college does not encourage the use of laptops for school work which is still expected to be handwritten. When the next Waterloo is fought, perhaps old Etonians will be able to instruct their servants to program the battle computers.<br>And last, but certainly not least:the ABC reported on Thursday that an Italian psychiatrist has found that a growing number of men are losing their friends, jobs, and sometimes all touch with reality because of Internet addiction.<br>Tonino Cantelmi has identified 24 cases of Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD), which is characterised by spending up to 10 hours a day surfing the Net, and physical symptoms such as shaking hands . . . but not with people.<br>Help Desk<br>Springfield: www.gpl.com.au/properties/spg00003/welcome.htmlcnet: www.cnet.com<br>The Times: www.the-times.co.uk/<br>ABC: www.abc.net.au<br></font></p>
