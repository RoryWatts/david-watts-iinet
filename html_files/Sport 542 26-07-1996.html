            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THREE different faces told three different, but equally dramatic, stories on the best day of the Games so far for Australia.<br>Matt Ryan's was almost inconsolable with grief, Shane Kelly's was strong with a determined fatalism, and Sarah Ryan's was as excited as a four-year-old's at Christmas.<br>Matt Ryan suffered torture by television when the cameras flashed to him as the Australian three-day event equestrian team snared its gold medal.<br>He had won gold with the team in Barcelona but was forced out of this event when his horse went lame. Gillian Rolton took his place, and she stood proud on the victory dais, her arm in a sling from bad falls in the cross-country leg.<br>Ryan watched and commented on the showjumping leg with Stan Grant and Lucinda Green.<br>He told the viewing audience how he could have been there, how he couldn't believe it. And the tears welled in his eyes. Grant and Green consoled him as well as they could and Ryan finally calmed down to praise his team.<br>Within minutes of the stirring medals ceremony - in which the horses were nicely rewarded with blue ribbons - Channel 7 cut live to tragedy.<br>Shane Kelly, world champion and record holder, was about to ride for what was seen as a certain medal in the cycling 1km time trial.<br>But he hardly left the blocks. Kelly's foot came loose from the pedal. He rode on a bit, but in an event where every thousandth of a second counts the damage had been fatal. He pulled out with a wave to disbelieving fans.<br>Drew Morphett and Phil Anderson were stunned. Morphett is never speechless but he sounded like a man lost in the wilderness as he tried to describe the staggering scene.<br>Some time later Morphett interviewed Kelly, who was composed and utterly professional, blaming no one but himself.<br>He said ?it's happened?, and he would be back for Sydney 2000.<br>His composure in the face of tragedy was moving, but freestyler Sarah Ryan's excitement at her medley relay team's silver medal was just as moving for the joy she conveyed.<br>Ryan, Samantha Riley - brilliant in her leg - Susie O'Neill and Nicole Stevenson surged in behind the US juggernaut.<br>Ryan swam last and when she touched she punched the air, jumped as far as it is possible in water, then broke out in a smile to beat all smiles.<br>The redhead renders the word bubbly meaningless. In the poolside chat with Neil Brooks, Stevenson - who has a dry wit - said Ryan was ?a bit excited?.<br>She had every reason to be so. The relay silver followed Scott Miller's second in the 100m butterfly and could be a sign of better times for the bronzed Aussies.<br>Those strong Irish names of Ryan, Riley and O'Neill contributed a badly needed kick in the Speedos to our doleful swimming record.<br>But, good as the silvers were, they paled in comparison to a real Irishwoman and another redhead.<br>The un-Irish sounding Michelle Smith took her third gold in the 200m individual medley, streeting the field from the boondocks of lane one. Ireland does not have one 50m pool in the entire country in which Smith can train. There is some sort of moral there for our heavily funded and hyped team ... not to mention our great expectations.<br>Comments on television coverage of the Games can be e-mailed to: watto@iinet.net.au.<br></font></p>
