            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">New releases<br>HERCULES<br>The critics have joined forces with the Greek Government to fling sharp-tipped javelins at Hercules, but the real target audience, the kids, gave it a big thumbs-up at the preview. They seem to care little that Disney's 35th animated feature veers wildly from the original myth and the muscle-bound mortal's 12 mountainous labours, enjoying instead the range of wise-cracking characters (beautifully voiced by James Woods, Danny DeVito, Bobcat Goldthwaith and Matt Frewer among others) that make this lively entertainment, not a slavish retelling of an epic. For a full review, turn to Arts Today. Rated G (David Watts)<br>NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTANH<br>Once upon a time American films about police corruption were deemed too remote, too American for Australian audiences. But with our newspapers filled with stories of wrong-doing in the State's law enforcement agencies, movies such as Night Falls on Manhattan become disturbingly relevant. Directed by Sydney Lumet, who has visited this precinct before (The Verdict, Prince of the City), Night Falls on Manhattan deals with a young assistant district attorney (Andy Garcia, with the improbable name Sean Casey) who is pulled into a major investigation into corruption in the New York Police Department after his veteran cop father (Ian Holm) is badly wounded in a drug bust. While this sounds like the set-up for an action-packed thriller, Lumet is more concerned with psychology and ethics, digging deep into the souls of men who exist in the shadowy world between guilt and innocence. The narrative doesn't quite hang together and the climax is a bit underwhelming, but the performances of Garcia and Holm are gritty and very believable. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSE DANCING<br>It has taken time but this highly publicised locally made romance set on Rottnest Island is finally getting a release. Apparently based on a true story, Under the Lighthouse Dancing is about a couple (the ambitious pairing of Jack Thompson and Jacqueline McKenzie) who take a group of close friends on a sailing trip to Rottnest. Early in the holiday the couple make the surprise announcement that they're going to get married on the island, a plan that is seriously jeopardised when a celebrant can't be found. However, McKenzie's Emma makes an important announcement that prompts the friends to make sure the wedding goes ahead. Under the Lighthouse Dancing marks the directing debut of Perth lawyer Graham Rattigan. Whether the film sinks or swims will depend less on pretty pictures of Rotto's beautiful bays and the twinkle in Thompson's eye and more on a good story, engaging dialogue and solid performances. At Revue Cinemas. Rated PG (Not Previewed)<br>WAITING FOR GUFFMAN<br>While it's hard to put out of your mind the classic episode of The Simpsons in which the folk of Springfield do a musical version of A Streetcar Named Desire ("You can always rely on the kindness of strangers,? bellow Marge, Ned, Apu and the gang), Waiting For Guffman is still a very funny take on small-town amateur theatrics. Borrowing the "'mockumentary'' technique of This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting For Guffman is about a bunch of no-hoper non-professionals in Blaine, Missouri, who are putting on a musical - Red, White and Blaine - depicting the town's history for its 150th anniversary. They're awful, of course, with New York Off-Off-Off Broadway veteran Corky St Clair (played by Christopher Guest) creating a gloriously campy version of the history of Blaine, the stool capital of the world. But director Guest is never condescending towards his starry-eyed performers, treating them with as much humanity as humour. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>YEAR OF THE DOGS<br>With sport such an important part of our culture it's surprising there are so few examples of its treatment by our writers and film-makers. Former journalist Michael Cordell goes some way towards correcting this imbalance with his revealing, wonderfully entertaining documentary about a year in the life of the Footscray Football Club (now the Western Bulldogs). Fortunately for the film, 1996 turned out to be a turbulent time for the Bulldogs, with coach Alan Joyce sacked halfway through the season and the resignation of the president. Cordell's film is essentially a fly-on-the wall account of the pain, the passion and the occasional joy of being a footballer - and of being a supporter of a struggling club. Sports fans and cinema-goers will find this intimate look at football helps explain why sport has such a hold on the national psyche. At the Luna. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>Recent releases<br>CAREER GIRLS<br>Some will find this awkward, ever-so-slight tale about two former uni flat-mates who get together for a nostalgic weekend a bit of a disappointment after the giddy highs of Mike Leigh's previous outing, Secrets and Lies. Still, Katrin Cartlidge and newcomer Lynn Steadman give compelling performances and there's a couple of wonderfully scurrilous anti-yuppie jokes. At the Luna and Revue. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>FACE/OFF<br>After the relative disappointments of Hard Target and Broken Arrow, John Woo has finally pulled off an American picture which captures the hyperbolic high style and bloody poetry of his best Hong Kong work. Woo also pushes his signature theme - that all men have the capacity for good and evil - into dizzying new territory by having the antagonists (played by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage) swap faces. The result is the year's most outrageously entertaining movie. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE LEOPARD<br>The re-release of Luchino Visconti's lush, richly detailed saga about the struggle of the Italian aristocracy to adjust to a changing, turbulent world couldn't be more timely. There's no high-speed carriage chases or paparazzi on horses but in Burt Lancaster's Don Fabrizio we can read all the agony of a class in the throes of death. But you have to admit they die in style, with the final hour taken up by the most breathtakingly beautiful ballroom scene ever filmed. At the Astor. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>MABO<br>With Mabo now standing for indigenous land rights it's easy to forget that it was once simply the name of a man. This powerful documentary tells the story of the Torres Strait Islander Eddie Koiki Mabo whose claim of ownership of his ancestral land became the test case which has forever changed the balance of power in this country. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated PG (Leeroy Betti)<br>MEN IN BLACK<br>The aliens patrolled by the eponymous hipsters played by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are not the typical marauding big-headed movie monsters but normal-looking folk as respectful of the American Dream as the millions who have passed through New York's Ellis Island. They have their quirks - Sylvester Stallone, Madonna, Dennis Rodman and, naturally, Elvis are among the aliens outed - but as long as they obey the law there's no problem. The jokes are scurrilous, the effects sensational but the most amusing notion is that tabloid newspapers are our only reliable source of information. ?Best investigative reporting on the planet,? says alien-buster Jones. ?You can read the New York Times. They get lucky sometimes.? Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>SUPER SPEEDWAY<br>If you've ever wondered what's it like sitting in an Indy car zooming at over 300kmh then buckle up for this stomach-turning documentary on the giant Omnimax screen. Moving between a series of races involving Michael Andretti and the restoration of a 1964 roadster, Super Speedway gives an interesting insight into a world where the difference between life and death is a sloppy turn. But be warned: this is one motion picture that lives up to its name. At Omni Theatre (Mark Naglazas)<br></font></p>
