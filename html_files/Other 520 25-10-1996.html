            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FIVE little words can signal a bad day. They are: ?Your house is on fire?. This is a bit extreme of course, but anecdotal evidence is that bad days usually start the night before.<br>This is when you set the cat and put out the alarm ... getting harder these days as many alarm clocks are plugged into the wall of your house.<br>Never mind - you settle down with a good mystery and discover the last page has been torn out. Then you slumber off, only to wake a few hours later because the water bed has broken ... only you don't even own a water bed.<br>Tired and bleary-eyed, you rise grumbling in the morning and go to the shop where you ask the deli owner for a single to the Terrace, please.<br>Luckily he understands, although the bus driver is slightly mystified an hour later when you demand a copy of The West Australian and a packet of PK.<br>Actually you are probably lucky you catch buses in Perth - despite recent evidence of privatisation chaos - rather than Sydney or London. Bus drivers in those cities are nowhere near as patient or tolerant as they are here.<br>Once in peak hour in a western Sydney suburb, I held the bus for about five seconds so that a little old lady could make it to the stop. I let her on, then I got in believing I had done a Good Thing. The driver, red of face, yelled ?You bloody big hero, get off. You can wait for the next one.?<br>In London, the driver did not even bother to let the little old lady on when I did a similar thing a few years later. He just went in the direction of away without a second glance.<br>There is an aura of magic about catching buses. I am sure every commuter has felt a bit like a wizard, or even a witch, when they make buses disappear simply by standing at the bus stop at a scheduled time. I swear it used to happen to me all the time in London ... run out of the office and there are dozens of buses prowling the angry, grey streets. Come to a stop at a ... well, stop ... and there is none to be seen, nor even heard.<br>But where were we? Bad days. There are several other ways to tell if you are having one. These I've heard in my perambulations:<br>?Your twin sister forgets your birthday.<br>?You put your bra on backwards and it fits better (this is even worse if you are a bloke).<br>?A crew from A Current Affair is waiting in your office.<br>?Your birthday cake collapses from the weight of the candles.<br>?You want to put on the clothes you wore home from the party ... and there aren't any.<br>?You turn on the TV news and they're displaying emergency routes out of town.<br>?Your horn goes off accidentally and remains stuck as you follow a group of Hell's Angels on the freeway.<br>???<br>SEVERAL readers have written or rung with sequels to last week's Quasimodo joke. That was the one in which Quasi trained a new bellringer but the poor fellow was knocked to his death by the bell. Quasi, asked if he knew the man, said: ?No, but the face rings a bell.?<br>Anyway, corny as it is, these readers were unanimous in their retelling of the following:<br>Quasi still wanted to give away the bellringing at Notre Dame and luckily the bishop had a candidate to replace the poor unfortunate who had gone to meet his maker with so much noise ringing in his ears.<br>As fate would have it, the candidate was the twin of the dead applicant. Quasi showed him the ropes. Pull back, heave heartily; get the bell going and it will ring.<br>The new man did it ... but, no, the same fate that befell his brother now felled him and crash into the square he went.<br>Quasi chased after him with grim resignation.<br>?Do you know this man?? asked one of the crowd.<br>?No, but he's a dead ringer for a bloke I met yesterday,? said the Hunchback.<br>???<br>HEADLINE we'd like to see: ?Man bakes cake with recipe found on the Internet?.<br></font></p>
