Far from making paper and binding redundant, the Net has provided one of the most successful and easy ways of getting more dead tree to more consumers. So much so, in fact, that it is difficult to know where you will get the best deal online.<br>Enter the Acses service, which presents you with the lowest price for any book you care to mention after scouring more than 20 online bookshops. It also takes into account shipping cost and will present the total cost to you in the currency of your choice.<br>Acses' remarkable system works by using the book's ISBN to quickly interrogate the other bookshops' search engines. It can then calculate the cost and will also give you an estimate of how long the book will take to get to you. This, of course, is an important part of cost when shipping a book from the US. At least 20 different prices will be given.The books are ordered by clicking on the right price/shipping time combination which then transports you to that particular bookshop. Acses shows the way for Internet middle-men services. (HC)<br>HEALTH<br>GlobalMedic<br>Scary, isn't it? Diagnoses handed out by automatic computer servers to ailing people all over the world. That is what GlobalMedic is all about. You go to the site, select your gender, then you are presented with a number of areas and select the one applicable to your symptoms. A few more questions and, bang, you are presented with a list of possible culprits. The areas covered are limited but more information is being added all the time.<br>GlobalMedic goes to great lengths to explain its diagnoses, which, though prepared by expert doctors and computer programmers, are not official and carry no weight. Everything should be checked with a real doctor. Of course, we at Access are in total agreement and suggest this site be used for entertainment only. Or maybe it could be a useful database for hypochondriacs.<br>GlobalMedic, founded in 1995 and based in Canada, also sells a range of products, such as health CD-ROMs. (HC)<br>SPORT<br>World Swimming Championships<br>All the news on the great events taking place at the Challenge Stadium even as we sit here idly chatting. Results from the 8th World Championships are being posted at this official site constantly, with the information broken down into headlines, stories, or full race results, depending on how far you want to go into the details. As well as the race results, the site has been displaying interesting titbits such as press releases regarding FINA's withdrawal of German coach Winfried Leopold's accreditation.<br>The site itself is slickly presented, with lots of active areas and an attractive interface. Being the official site, you also get information on buying tickets, programs, corporate activities, sponsors and the like. (HC)<br>LITERATURE<br>The Dynamic Alice in Wonderland<br>Lewis Carroll's classic has always been a bit different. Never more so than in this online edition, which basically adds words and music at key places by using very simple multimedia technologies such as MIDI files and GIF animations.<br>The delightful tale starts with an invitation to click on the Cheshire Cat's fading and then re-emerging grin on the front cover. This opens an index of the contents chapter by chapter plus lots of information about how and why the site's creators, Megabrands, did it.Each chapter opens and closes with music and every now and then various characters, such as the White Rabbit, can be clicked on to hear small snippets of dialogue.<br>There is nothing fancy, certainly no Java, so this site loads and plays quite quickly provided you have a version 3.0 browser at least. (DW)<br>HISTORY<br>Titanic: Encyclopaedia Britannica special<br>Film heart-throbs Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet spend three hours and 14 minutes sinking in the popular movie showing around Perth at the moment. This Encyclopaedia Britannica guided tour takes less time and even if it lacks the screen romance, it is as informative and educational as it is possible to be.For those who came in late, the Titanic was going to be the unsinkable passenger ship. It hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in April 1912 and the unsinkable did the unthinkable ? it sank. About 1500 people died.<br>Britannica presents the whole story, from conception of the big ship to its unbelievable loss, in a series of photographs reminiscent of an art gallery display. It includes a well researched and written introduction that acts as a narrative and shows Titanic buffs other good resources about the ship on the Web.<br>These include the Discovery Channel's Titanic: Raising a Legend; RMS Titanic Online and Tribute to the RMS Titanic. (DW)<br>GEOGRAPHY<br>Maps and Geography of the World<br>The beauty of this site, produced by the Mining Company, is the wealth of links to the informative National Geographic site. Nearly every country from Angola to Zimbabwe has a variety of maps available. Some, but not all, are from National Geographic, which provides links to potted histories of countries featured.<br>Other maps come from the CIA's excellent World Factbook and there is a huge placenames database for Australia. (DW)<br>COMICS<br>Calvin and Hobbes<br>For fans of the strange young boy and his stuffed tiger hankering after a bit more of the famous comic, this site provides a new strip every day. The only catch is, and there has to be catch on these great money-spinners, they are exactly 11 years old. As well as the three or four black-and-white panel strips presented on weekdays, there is a colour weekend version, similar to the more modern versions which appear in The West Australian on Saturdays.<br>The age of the comics doesn't matter, of course - Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson was just as creative and funny when he was writing and drawing the material in 1987 as he was when he gave up on January 1, 1996.<br>In case you thought this site was put up for the benefit of Calvin and Hobbes fans and nothing else, think again. The site has storerooms full of merchandise to sell you, from high-quality prints of the last colour strip to the actual books.<br>There are also articles about Watterson and the demise of the strip. (HC)<br>LOCAL NEWS<br>The West Australian News Review<br>This site has nothing to do with this newspaper, though they share the first three letters of their names. The West Australian News Review provides small snippets of news about events in Perth, taken, according to the site's creator Kim Murray, from a variety of sources. The information is updated weekly and is aimed primarily at ?the many West Australians who are wandering the world thirsty for news from home?.<br>The news is presented well, as a single page divided into one-paragraph stories of about 100 words. Given the lack of other online news sources in this town, The West Australian News Review could well be a vital link to home for remote West Aussies. The Review is one part of a bigger site called perth-wa.com, also maintained by Mr Murray, which includes an online version of the Augusta-Margaret River Mail and tourism newspaper Cruising the Cape.
