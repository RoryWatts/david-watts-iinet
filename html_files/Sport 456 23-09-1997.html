            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Do not expect much sense to come out of Melbourne or Adelaide this week.<br>Both cities will be blanketed by footy fever as St Kilda prepares to repel the Adelaide Crows in the AFL grand final this Saturday.<br>Netizens can join the grand final action at many Web sites. One for those who love nostalgia is Channel 7's Grand Final Teams.<br>On display are the results and teams of every grand final since the final four was begun in 1931. Of special interest are the details of the Saints' only premiership in 1966 when they beat Collingwood by a point.<br>Footy buffs, especially Saints fans, can also check out that historic team which included names such as Brian Sierakowski, Verdun Howell, Ian Stewart, Darryl Baldock, Barry Breen and Kevin Cowboy Neale.<br>The Seven site has details of the AFL Hall of Fame, Brownlow medallists and 100 years of goal statistics.<br>Also on the statistical front is the All-Time League Ladder which lists each club's record in all matches, including finals, since the VFL/AFL's inception.<br>The interesting statistic here is that Collingwood has the best win-loss ratio, taking 62.76 per cent of its matches since 1897. Carlton has won 62.41 per cent in the same time as well as 57.14 per cent of its grand finals. West Coast has a win-loss percentage of 61.98.<br>Saturday's combatants are humble by comparison. Adelaide, which joined the AFL in 1991, has won 48 per cent of its games. St Kilda is a cellar dweller with a 37.35 per cent ratio.<br>Both grand finalists have Web sites. Adelaide's is an official one run by the club and St Kilda has several unofficial ones run by supporters.<br>All are full of player biographies and pictures, results, club news and one of the Saints' pages has audio files of radio broadcasts of the season's big games.<br>One of the best launch-pads to football sites is the aptly titled Footy Links which boasts more than 250 links.<br>HELP DESK<br>Grand Final Teams: www.seven.com.au/afl/players/afl-grandfinals.html<br>All-Time League Ladder: www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Stage/3359/aflatll.htm<br>Adelaide official: www.afc.com.au/afc/nest.htm<br>St Kilda unofficial: www.ozemail.com.au/-dzalcman/stkilda/<br>Another unofficial Saints page: www.rint.com.au/-simmo/<br>Footy Links: www.ozemail.com.au/-statware/statlink.html<br></font></p>
