            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE battle for East Timor's independence has been fought on the Web for several years now.<br>Scores of sites have been set up in Australia, Europe and the United States to put the case against Indonesia's occupation.<br>But perhaps the biggest mark of the medium's democratic influence is that pro-Timor surfers can even let Indonesian President BJHabibie know their feelings.<br>Dr Habibie, an advocate of new technology, has his own Web page where he displays important speeches, pictures and press releases.<br>A highlight is the prominent display of his e-mail address, as well as a forum allowing Netizens to leave comments on any issue.<br>Whether he personally checks his e-mail or responds to the comments is impossible to determine. And the fact that his site can often be slow to load, or will not respond because of congestion or poor connections, makes it frustrating to use.<br>The fact is it is there, making Dr Habibie as accessible as any Australian politician.<br>More easily accessible and responsive are the sites that support East Timorese independence or act as showcases of anti-Indonesian views.<br>The East Timor Action Network, based in the US, uses a cartoon image of a war-hungry Indonesian soldier to emphasise its headline links.<br>These highlight actions against the civilian population. Last week they included the claim that more than 1000 armed pro-Indonesian paramilitary members took control of Dili, attacked civilians, shot into buildings, and ransacked and burnt homes.<br>ETAN uses such headlines to call for rallies and protests against Indonesia in the US.<br>It also has links to news resources such as CNN and Reuters when they run major Timor stories.<br>ETAN's site also includes links to resources about the country as well as a repository of images.<br>The East Timor home page, hosted in Sydney, acts as the home site for the East Timor Relief Association.<br>ETRA says it is ?working for peace, self determination, democracy and equitable development in East Timor?.<br>The site is full of up-to-date news and calls for action. It highlights press releases by Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao calling for international action to protect the population.<br>ETRA compiles a monthly newsletter called Matebian News as well as a radio program called Radio Timor Oan. The site has archives of Matebian News going back five years. ETRA also distributes Matebian to newsgroups such as alt.society.indonesia and aus.politics to try to keep Net users up to date with its inside news and views.<br>ETRA's site is rich in information about Timor's history, its pro-independence leaders and support groups throughout the world.<br>The East Timor Human Rights Centre has a site hosted on Murdoch University's server.<br>It describes itself as an independent centre for the promotion of human rights in East Timor and uses links to news reports to highlight abuses such as executions and mass shootings. The ETHRC site encourages people to contact both the Indonesian Government and Australian politicians to lobby against Indonesia's activities.<br>University Students for East Timor is an activist group that has operated from the Melbourne University student union for six years. It has built a dramatic-looking Web site full of active images to reinforce its opposition to Indonesia.<br>USET says that because Australian students enjoy a society which allows political protest and action, they have a duty to focus on East Timor's plight.<br>The site highlights news from the province as well as pro-Timorese activities in Australia. It also encourages surfers to join campaigns by sending free protest faxes from the site to Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.<br>The site is also a home to a protest e-mail campaign, calling on people to send mail to United Nations SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan, demanding a referendum on independence.<br>USET also publishes a page of links to other East Timor sites, including Community Aid Abroad and Fretilin.<br>More news and resources can be found at Timor Today, the site of the East Timor International Support Centre.<br>From Portugal, former ruler of East Timor, the Timor Net site provides a wide array of resources including news, links to protest sites and history.<br>Help Desk<br>BJ Habibie:<br>habibie.ristek.go.id/<br>english/english.htm<br>East Timor Action Network:<br>www.etan.org<br>East Timor Home Page:<br>www.pactok.net.au/docs/et/<br>East Timor Human Rights<br>Centre:<br>apchr.murdoch.edu.au/<br>minihub/ethrc/index.htm<br>Uni Students for East Timor:<br>www.uset.org.au<br>USET links page:<br>www.uset.org.au/links.html<br>Timor Today:<br>www.easttimor.com<br>Timor Net:<br>www.uc.pt/Timor/netret.htm<br></font></p>
