            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE big bag of sporting goodies served up on television at the weekend had as many boiled lollies as it did chocolates.<br>West Coast's heart-stopping win against Sydney and the hype surrounding Tony Lockett's bid for the goal-kicking record produced an atmosphere and standard worthy of a final.<br>To be churlish, a perfect day for genuine footy followers might have seen Plugger kick six and the Eagles still win.<br>But you cannot have everything, and now Eddie McGuire will at least have more to talk about on the Footy Show as Lockett's next record bid will be against Collingwood.<br>Unfortunately, one of the things you cannot have is accuracy in commentating.<br>Bruce McAvaney belied his reputation for encyclopedic knowledge of the game by constantly mixing up Drew Banfield and Daniel Metropolis. He had similar problems with some of the Eagles young guns who all seemed to look like Phil Read to him.<br>And he called Rowan Jones well after the classy youngster had departed the field with a knee injury.<br>Still, McAvaney was reasonably restrained in the face of much excitement and seemed as well held as Lockett himself by the talkative Jason Dunstall.<br>Television viewing figures indicate that 468,000 Perth people watched the live telecast on Channel 7. That is 100,000 more than an average Eagles Sunday game, emphasising the Lockett hype was not restricted to Sydney alone.<br>The same figures showed that Perth Glory's loss to Sydney United in the National Soccer League preliminary final - shown live on the ABC with all but the first 20 minutes colliding with Pluggermania - attracted an audience of 161,000.<br>So, West Coast not only beat Sydney, Lockett and Pluggermania; it easily outshone the Glory on its big day as well.<br>The ABC's State manager, Geoff Duncan, said yesterday the Glory audience figure was still pleasing. ?Only an AFL grand final would have rated as much (as the Swans game) so we are extremely pleased with that figure,? he said. ?The past few weeks have demonstrated that there is a definite demand from the public to provide ongoing coverage of the games throughout the season.?<br>The feeling of mixed blessings extended to the Australia-Pakistan World Cup cricket match shown live on Channel 9 on Sunday night.<br>What a joy it was to see such aggressive batting. What a pain the Pakistanis were doing it.<br>And although we are hearing less of Ian Chappell, Tony Greig and Bill Lawry - which will no doubt please some people - it is only because Nine has decided to let hosts Ray Martin and Simon O'Donnell get in for more than their fair share of talk and advertising promotion.<br>The biggest mixed blessing of all was on Saturday night. It was a treat to see Fremantle fight back against such quality opposition as the Kangaroos. But, again it was disheartening to see the endeavour fail through poor goal kicking.<br></font></p>
