            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MY FRIEND Bill has a theory well worth airing. It is that by 2020 the prime minister's name will be Shane and his wife will be called Sky ... or vice versa.<br>This is based on the power of sheer sensible observation. In Bill's office all the 18-to-25-year-old males are either Shane, Jason or Nathan. Their girlfriends are Sky, Rachel (more commonly Rach) or Sarah.<br>In 2020 these youngsters will be greying 42-to-49-year-olds (ha ha) and will dominate nomenclature of that time.<br>Bill reckons the experience in his office is repeated throughout this great land, so the likelihood of a Shane-Sky partnership emerging is big. And they might make it all the way to The Lodge.<br>This is even more credible given that, according to Bill, most office tea clubs he has supped in are run by Shanes, sometimes Jasons. They throw their weight around, too, leaving imperious little memos on office noticeboards or computer message systems which say things such as: ?Milk will now have to be paid for ... wash all cups after use? etc.<br>Oh the power. It could lead to Canberra.<br>Having just had a visit from Bill and Hillary Clinton, the subject of powerful names seems apt. Right now we are in the middle of being governed, globally that is, by people born mostly during the 1940s. So the popular names of that time are prominent.<br>Here in Australia we have John and Janette. England has John and Norma. WA has slightly younger incumbents and the names Richard and Jo are a bit of a giveaway.<br>The next generation of power mongers are likely to bear monikers such as David and Sue or Peter and Chris or Mark and Debbie. Then will follow Justin and Julie, Jack and Emily, and Nathan and Storm.<br>The generation popping out now will be in charge about 2050. What names will they bring?<br>Here are some that won't be around, if today's parents act sensibly.<br>For a start I would say it is a safe bet there will be no Adolf or Mao, no O.J. and no Gay.<br>It is also debatable that there will be many Idis, Saddams or Bjelkes. I have doubts about there being a Pauline. But you never can tell.<br>While on the subject of parents, let us focus on mothers. After death and taxes, it is still a certainty of life that everyone has had a mother.<br>The things they say and do to us often last a lifetime, and it is sometimes with horror that today's GYMs (gorgeous young mums) find themselves uttering the same words they always vowed never to repeat.<br>Here are a few examples:<br>Keep doing that with your face and it'll stay that way.<br>This hurts me more than it hurts you.<br>Wait until you grow up and have kids of your own.<br>You're in big trouble when your father comes home.<br>Because I SAID so.<br>How do you know you don't like it if you haven't tried it?<br>Let me kiss it and make it better.<br>But Popeye eats all his spinach.<br>Here comes the aeroplane/train (actually, a spoon with a fetid object upon it).<br>No, because if we get a puppy then I'll end up walking and bathing and feeding it. If all your friends jumped off the Narrows Bridge, would you jump too?<br>I don't care what the other kids are wearing. No child of mine is going to wear his pants backwards/a hat inside a house/ a nose ring/ a rattail/his shoelaces untied/ underwear on the outside of her clothing/ a mini-skirt.<br>Why didn't you go before we got in the car?<br>Eat your peas, there are children starving in Bosnia/Rwanda/Africa/Russia/India.<br>What do you mean Elvis isn't cool?<br>Don't run with that - you'll poke your eye out.<br>Do you know how many hours I was in labour with you?<br>No, and that's final!<br></font></p>
