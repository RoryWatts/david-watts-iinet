            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">You have probably heard of the seven-year itch. Well, on the hyped-up, speed-obsessed Internet, make that the six-week itch.<br>Last week marked the sixth week of the official full release of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 for Windows95 and Windows NT.<br>It also marked a flurry of press releases claiming that MSIE 4.0 had made significant inroads into Netscape's domination of the Web browser market.Microsoft cleared the decks at its IE site to shout about a survey that gives it nearly 40 per cent market share. It also claimed MSIE 4.0 was now number one in 19 countries including the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan.MS quoted several sources showing the growth in popularity of its mega-browser/operating shell program. A census by Dataquest put Netscape's Navigator at 57.6 per cent and IE at 39.4. And Dataquest predicted that IE would reach parity with Navigator by about April-May next year.<br>Figures available at Zona Research were also flattering. They showed IE's share at 3 per cent in February 1996, 4 in April 96, 8 in August 96, 28 in January 97 and 36 in September this year - a month before the official IE4 release.Statistics can be used to say whatever you want. This batch seems to spell good news for Microsoft and put a darkish cloud over Netscape. MS, as if it needed to, is moving inexorably to number one. It already makes the operating systems on 80 per cent of computers in the world.Now it is six or seven months away from making the browser for most Internet users.It is trendy to dislike Microsoft. It is big, rich and powerful. Its boss Bill Gates is reputed to be the world's richest man with a personal fortune of $40 billion.So MS should be able to stand aside gracefully and allow a smaller and arguably more innovative company such as Netscape have the browser market to itself.Fat chance. The computer industry at this level - being the most looked-at interface for more than 50 million Web surfers - is capitalism at its most naked and savage.<br>Microsoft with its huge profits and big development staff is able to give MSIE 4.0 away free on the Net. Netscape is shareware because the California company of Marcus Andreesen is still a minnow and needs income to keep developing its first-class product.<br>Mr Gates is swamping the Net with a hard-to-resist product (because not only is it free, it also works well). This is similar to the tactic of Rupert Murdoch selling The Times in London at a bizarre low cover price one day a week so his News Corporation can dominate the quality newspaper market.<br>Mr Murdoch can take the losses because he controls a very profitable empire elsewhere. Ditto Mr Gates.<br>American consumer advocate Ralph Nader has been making impassioned pleas against MS on the Web for some time now. In the Slate online magazine he put the following points in The Case Against Microsoft:n Microsoft ? is spending tens (perhaps hundreds) of millions of dollars to develop and promote MSIE, which it gives away.Why? By monopolising the browser market ? Microsoft will be in a position to transform the Internet radically by moving toward a new set of Microsoft-owned or Microsoft-controlled standards.n Microsoft wants to hold our hand as we navigate the information superhighway and to push us - not so subtly - toward its own partners or subsidiaries.But just as eloquent is a defence by Washington lawyer Rick Rule, also in Slate, and called The Case against the Case against Microsoft. Mr Rule makes these points (they refer especially to the US Justice Department's anti-trust action against MS wanting new Win95 PCs to have IE4 packaged as an integral part):n (The) inclusion of IE with Windows does not prevent computer manufacturers from installing competing browsers or putting those browsers on the desktop. Indeed, the computer companies that wanted to take IE off their desktops probably intended to give Netscape Navigator an exclusive position. Microsoft did not demand that Netscape be removed, only that IE be there as well.Taxpayers are employing an army of lawyers and economists who spend their every waking moment . . . thinking of ways to get Microsoft . . . their efforts have turned up precious little.<br>People who care about the fate of the Net should read both arguments. At the moment the Net's ability to put myriad sides of critical arguments so that people can decide for themselves, and most importantly have their say, is still its biggest asset.<br></font></p>
