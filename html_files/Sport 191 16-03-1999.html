            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FEW years from now, we might be able to sit back and laugh at the current state of sport on TV.<br>By then a combination of the Internet and digital TV should enable viewers to choose their own sporting menus.<br>You can't do that now because TV sport coverage is a mess.<br>Channel 7 has AFL football, but will not show it at peak times in Sydney or Brisbane because it does not rate. It also owns the rights to Australian soccer but does not show the national league.<br>Channel 9 has cricket, but only domestic or English Ashes series Tests and one-dayers. It will not chase Tests outside those areas, and only shows shield matches occasionally.<br>Nine also has the National Rugby League, which it hides after midnight in WA because it does not rate.<br>Ten devotes itself to water and motor sports to satisfy its younger audience. It also tackles the Melbourne spring racing carnival.<br>The ABC picked up the National Basketball League when the big boys decided it did nothing for them. It also has the soccer as a hand-me-down.<br>SBS has nearly every other soccer match in the world covered, and along with Ten, makes a fist of cycling. We also have pay-TV, whose dedicated sport channels look possible saviours.<br>But Foxtel is only on a few thousand screens here. It shows a mix of rugby league, rugby union, English soccer, overseas cricket, wrestling, boxing and so-called extreme sports -- but no AFL.<br>Optus, which shows AFL along with rugby league, Australian soccer and Sheffield Shield matches, is not in WA yet.<br>To further complicate matters, Channel 7 has a pay-TV arm which provides Optus with three sporting channels. From April 1 its C7 Sports, with AFL, rugby league, tennis, golf and rugby union will be made available to Austar, which claims it provides satellite pay-TV to more than 300,000 Australians in country areas. But its Net site lists no offices in WA.<br>All that sport, and yet the reality is average Perth viewers miss sporting gems each week because most of it is just plain unavailable. In the past three days most people would not have seen, for example:<br>?The nail-biting Sheffield Shield match against Victoria that WA managed to draw so it could make the final against Queensland.<br>?Mark Philippoussis spoiling new world No.1 Carlos Moya's party with a five-set victory in the Champions Cup final.<br>?Brian Lara's double century in the West Indies fightback against Australia.<br>?Wasim Akram's second hat-trick in successive Tests.<br>? Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis clubbing each other into submission in the drawn world heavyweight championship which one British newspaper called ?the crime of the century?.<br>?WA's win in the King's Cup rowing.<br>?Danny Milosevic's shenanigans in Perth Glory's victory over Gippsland.<br>Has anyone got a spare TV channel going cheap?<br></font></p>
