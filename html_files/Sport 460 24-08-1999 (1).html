            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GREAT sporting feats - even those by someone with great sporting feet (sorry) - do not necessarily command the biggest audiences.<br>Ian Thorpe's 400m freestyle world record on Sunday was a phenomenal achievement by any measure, yet it attracted a modest 144,000 viewers to Channel 9's coverage of the Pan Pacific championships at the peak couch potato hour of 6.30pm.<br>Yet earlier in the year, this time slot was attracting enormous crowds of 300,000 and 400,000 for delayed telecasts of the second half of West Coast or Fremantle matches.<br>That was before Melbourne commandeered our home games and declared they should start after 8pm on Saturdays, so that eastern viewers could wallow in two successive live AFL matches.<br>Never mind that families in Perth had to think twice about going to the football because - unless they spat the dummy over their team's lamentable performance and left early - they would not be safe at home until 11.30pm at the earliest.<br>Or those who had opted to stay at home had to lie to their children as they tucked them in bed: ?Night, night darling. All's well with the world. The Dockers have kicked the first goal of the third quarter and are 14 points up.?<br>But back to Thorpe and the Pan Pacs. It is hard to see the public resisting these championships for the rest of the week, now they have started with such a bang.<br>Nine commentator Nicole Stevenson told this column in an e-mail interview that the Pan Pacs ranked behind both the Olympics and the world titles in terms of importance, but had immense value as a guide to next year's Games, particularly as they were being held in the Olympic pool.<br>Stevenson, who earned notoriety during last year's Commonwealth Games by saying that a male swimmer was lactating, also gave a valuable insight into why so many recently retired athletes strayed happily into the media.<br>?Normally it would be hard to retire and not be involved, but this way I still get to be around the pool, the atmosphere and my friends, without having to get up at 4.30am every morning,? she said.<br>Basically, a fair bit of gain without the pain.<br>Maintaining the link to the on-field drama might explain the presence of so many recently retired stars behind the microphone.<br>In football, not-so-old big names are everywhere - John Worsfold, Jason Dunstall, Mick McGuane and Richard Osborne to name a few.<br>None of which explains Bruce McAvaney's addiction to the commentator's life.<br>He is in Seville, Spain, burbling enthusiastically over the world athletics championships.<br>It is doubtful Seven will get huge audiences for these titles. The athletics is without doubt the most global and important sporting event on our screens this week. The Pan Pacs would rank second and football, if you were serious, is about important as Taiwanese softball in the greater scheme of things.<br>But no prizes for guessing the sport that will get most bums on seats.<br></font></p>
