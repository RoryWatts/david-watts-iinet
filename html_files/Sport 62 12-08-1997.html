            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FRASER GEHRIG nearly ruined my weekend.<br>But it was partly my own fault. During the quarter time break of the big game on Saturday I stepped on to the veranda to check out the real world, have a cup of tea and wonder how West Coast might impose itself on the gutsy Hawthorn, which was a point up.<br>When I settled back in front of the tube, the Eagles were 17 points ahead, according to the helpful little scoreboard in the top left corner of the screen.<br>In four minutes - less than the time it takes for a cuppa and a good look round - Gehrig had scored three goals and the game had settled back to a hard slog with Hawthorn making most of the play.<br>By missing the brilliant Gehrig spree, the impression I got was that the Eagles found Hawthorn a handful and were lucky to win.<br>Gehrig was a big difference of course, but Ken Judge's comments that West Coast made the most of its chances, hit its targets and made Hawthorn pay for any mistakes, probably best sum up the side.<br>Well, I missed Gehrig's goals on the TV news and the Sunday footy shows too, but the sporting weekend had more than enough to compensate.<br>Fremantle's runaway victory over Richmond in foul weather at the WACA Ground on Saturday night was the No.1 highlight.<br>It was an ideal night for curling up in front of a heater and warm TV, made even warmer by the pacy brilliance of the Dockers.<br>If Gerard Neesham's talented boys can keep their heads, next week's clash with St Kilda promises to turn Saturday afternoon into couch potato heaven. It could be a feast of fast, attacking footy.<br>Shane Warne was a treat at the weekend too. The way he arrogantly imposed himself on England's batsmen - who had their chances - in the fifth Test at Trent Bridge tells so much about the yawning gap between the Ashes combatants.<br>Channel 9, when it feels disposed, shows some good pictures from England.<br>Few were better than the close-ups and replays of the Warne delivery that bowled Nasser Hussain in the first innings.<br>It drifted tantalisingly outside leg stump, then bit like a mad dog and crashed into the off stump.<br>England has a good side - witness the speed at which it made runs.<br>But Australia has a very good side - witness the speed at which it took wickets.<br>It was a good Test which made life hard for Seven's coverage of the world athletics from Athens.<br>Australia did well and the viewers were able to wrap themselves in excitement thanks to the ever-enthusiastic Bruce McAvaney.<br>There was little coverage, but the under-23 basketball world championship and gold at the Pan-Pacific swimming made it a good weekend.<br>Next weekend I must remember to watch Fraser Gehrig like a hawk - but come to think of it, they didn't do a very good job.<br></font></p>
