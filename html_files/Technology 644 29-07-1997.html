            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Long, long ago in the good old days of late 1995, life on the Web seemed so simple. Even the novice computer user could, after a few tutorials, point his or her mouse at a hyperlink and travel to a Web site. And it was normally a pretty simple piece of work, perhaps a coloured background and a few GIFs, maybe, horror of horrors, some blinking or coloured text.<br>That sort of simplicity will be a thing of the past soon. Netscape with its handsome Communicator 4.01 wants to take over every minute of your Internet time. Microsoft, as might be guessed, is about to take over everything on your computer with Internet Explorer 4.0.<br>MSIE 4.0 is in its second preview release on the Web. It appears to be a solid product with an excellent browser that beats the Netscape equivalent for speed and features.<br>But browsing the Web, once the rather relaxed, entertaining and at times informative lure of the Net is fast becoming a secondary concern in the Microsoft-Netscape battle.<br>Both companies want to dominate the Net.<br>The victim appears to be the random, quirky, indeed the very human nature that has epitomised the Net for at least two years.<br>The attraction of surfing and coming across either a grand piece of idiocy or, equally, a compelling spot of profundity helped propel the Net into the public imagination. With lightning-fast communication and a fairly easy ability to turn mere mortals into self-publishers via simple HTML, the Net has become a threatening alternative to passive TV viewing in millions of homes.<br>Now both browser giants seem to want to turn the clock back to making Netizens a captive, rather than an active, audience.<br>Both are making their competing push technology central features of their browsers.<br>Push technology enables pre-programmed sites to be updated at regular times and loaded to the user's hard disk, facilitating off-line retrieval and browsing. As an accompaniment to self-exploration of the Web, it is probably a good idea.<br>What both companies are ?pushing? - Microsoft through its Channels and Netscape through Netcaster - has very little to do with the free-wheeling, open-minded Web we know.<br>MSIE Channels include the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Disney, Warner Brothers, National Geographic and, not surprisingly, the Microsoft Network and MSNBC, the amalgam of Microsoft and NBC.<br>Netcaster pushes CNN, American ABC news, CBS and Wired magazine. Both have the CNet organisation, a dominant player on the Web.<br>They are all big corporations intent on spreading their word and products and obviously now have better potential to reach more than 40 million people.<br>The worry is that push technology is too much like other more passive media. It spoonfeeds the user with content, which, by the way, is a bit hard and slow to access in both companies' beta releases, but will become easier.<br>The other disadvantage is that, unlike the early, easy days of point and click to surf the Web, configuring push technology is comparatively complicated. The user is confronted with a list of possible content providers but no intuitive way to access them. Again, the developers will no doubt solve that in time ? unfortunately.<br>The other sign that the Web, in particular, is about to become less people-friendly is the growing complexity of HTML, the lingua franca of the Web developed in 1989. Even the least technically minded can write simple HTML to create a Web page.<br>That was until recently. The development of cascading style sheets and layers is an attractive one, enabling people to create quite dynamic and beautiful Web pages that are animated and interact with the surfer.<br>However, the people who will be creating these things of beauty will not be the mums and dads and kids. They are likely to be software developers or nerds with hectares of the free time needed to learn the new HTML.<br>The possible good thing among all this rather gloomy forecast is that no one knows what 45 million users are going to do. You cannot take for granted that they will just sit back and dumbly be told to use push technology or quit writing simple HTML.<br>The beauty of the Web will be in its users, or meatware, which is much harder to control than software or hardware.<br></font></p>
