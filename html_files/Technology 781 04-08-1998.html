            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WEB Sights and selections of Help Desks and columns are available on the Web at www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/<br>access/access.html.<br>CARS CarNet<br>www.carnet.com.au<br>CARNET does not include many WA dealers or deals yet. However, it is an excellent site for shopping around for a new car with its pull-down menu that allows users to get the latest retail prices for everything from an Alfa to a Volkswagen.<br>Other features include guides to car auctions, online used car classifieds and the ability to e-mail your own for sale ads.<br>NOSTALGIA Swingin'<br>Chicks of the 60s<br>www.swinginchicks.<br>com/workitfordaddy.htm<br>A LOT of the gloss has been taken off this popular site now that its creators are asking for money.<br>They want $2 from people who would like to immerse themselves fully in the psychedelia and silliness of the 1960s and find out more about the gorgeous girls who filled the screens and top 40s of the time.<br>However, it costs nothing to browse the list that rates the girls in order of swingingness, and it is a spot of harmless fun for trivia buffs. The top five swingers rated at the site are: Ann-Margret, Stella Stevens, Catherine Deneuve, Diana Rigg and Julie Christie. Honourable mentions go to Jane Fonda, Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot.<br>TRIVIA Didja Know<br>powered.zoo3.cs.yale.<br>edu:8000/ ~miller/didja/<br>MANY people suspect that the web is full of untruths. The Didja Know site confirms this in a lovely, light-hearted way. Each day it presents five statements - sent in by Netizens - and asks people to pick the one that is factual.<br>It is hard to tell the lies from the truth because nearly all submissions give the impression they just might be true.<br>PEOPLE Y? National Forum on People's<br>Differences<br>www.yforum.com/index.html<br>THIS site aims to provide a global feedback forum that answers questions from normal people about the cultural and other perceived differences between the races. In the process it aims to educate and improve tolerance.<br>Its motto is ?Dare to Ask. Dare to Answer?. A good example of communal co-operation on the super highway.<br>COMPUTERS Free<br>Web Disk Drive<br>www.freedrive.com/<br>THIS facility may help people who work regularly on different computers, say one at home and one at work and need to take big files from one to the other.<br>FreeDrive provides a password-protected folder on the web which holds up to 7.5Mb, or more than five floppy disks. You could upload a big program to the folder from your home computer then download it to your work one later in the day.<br>Users can share files in their space with other registered FreeDrivers.<br>SPORT Westar Links<br>www.iinet.net.<br>au/ ~tigers/links.htm<br>ONE of the many good pages at the unofficial Claremont Football Club home page. This one has links to all the local Westar Rules sites and many others.<br>Westar may not have the presence of AFL football, but its fans and their web sites are just as passionate and devoted as the so-called big boys.<br></font></p>
