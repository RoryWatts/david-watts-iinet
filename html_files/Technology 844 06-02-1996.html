            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE major parties are being cautious to timid about using the Internet as an election forum.<br>Neither Labor nor the Liberals had mentioned the Mundinburra by-election in Queensland on their officially sanctioned World Wide Web sites by yesterday afternoon.<br>The Liberal Party had not even mentioned the election as a topical event on its main page, but still had outdated references to the Queensland election and the national Young Liberals conference.<br>Most of the running in election comment and news is being made by political devotees and students at private sites on the Web.<br>The official Labor site remains the only political site where voters of all persuasions are encouraged to have their say and post e-mail comments which are then published at the Soapbox site.<br>This openness has led to several anti-Labor and anti-Keating attacks being posted.<br>The Net election is in fact only echoing the campaign on the traditional hustings. The Liberals are not saying much and Labor is standing on its record and the personality of Mr Keating.<br>The Liberal site, run by self-confessed conservative David Moss, a technical officer at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra, received official party blessing last week when endorsed by Federal secretary Andrew Robb.<br>The site has not added anything new to the election debate, but it does publish all official Liberal policy as it becomes available.<br>Away from the main parties, only the Australian Democrats appear overly interested in using the Net as a campaign tool.<br>Under the party's slogan, Keep the bastards honest, the Democrats' official site lists 10 companies thought to be traditionally Australian - Arnotts, Edgell, Castlemaine-Toohey, Drizabone and Bundaberg Sugar are included. The party then points out all are in foreign hands.<br>It is part of the Democrats' campaign to protect Australia's future.<br>But day-to-day topicality is ignored. There is no mention of the Democrats' stand on Opposition Leader John Howard's Telstra sell-off plan, for example.<br>The National Party ignores the election completely. It has a site, again drawn up by David Moss, which is simply a one-page statement of the party's principles.<br>The Greens (WA) have long been represented on the Net, but there is no evidence of their using it as a forum in this campaign.<br>?West Web, page 45<br></font></p>
