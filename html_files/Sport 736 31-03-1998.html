            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">RUGBY league is back on our screens, and boy is it hot.<br>The reunited game, fresh from the mad disruption of Rupert Murdoch's attempt to control sport in every continent, had been unsighted until 11.45pm on Friday.<br>Even though Channel 9 here waited until round three to show the newly named National Rugby League competition, it returned with a bang.<br>I think Balmain upset Manly 18-4 in front of a passionate home crowd.<br>But details became elusive because of the nature of the ads that littered the game.<br>One was for a phone-sex outfit, though why anyone would want to have sex with a phone is hard to imagine. Another was from the Hustler organisation and featured a room crammed with scantily clad young women.<br>There were about a dozen of them but they had barely enough clothes for one.<br>The final shot in this ad featured a blonde so scantily clad that she had nothing on at all ... except the routine leer as she picked up the phone.<br>It certainly made a change from listening to Ewen McCormick's theories about real football.<br>Parents who intend taping league for their children might want to do some early-morning editing if this trend continues.<br>Of course, the rugby league was a mere sideshow to the real sporting action - round one of the AFL season on Channel 7.<br>It was strangely flat. The North-West Coast opener was a beauty - what is the betting that Adam Simpson could ever repeat his match-winning, left-footed snap - but the rest of the round was mostly indifferent.<br>Carlton-Adelaide was a dull game with an exciting finish. Boundary rider Neil Kerley had to eat his half-time words of ?people who say Adelaide is a soft side are wrong?.<br>St Kilda-Geelong was typical Waverley stuff. The Cats got lost in the open spaces.<br>We saw four or five shots of Collingwood-Hawthorn on the AFL Winners, but got more of Carlton-Adelaide and North-West Coast, games which had already been given full cover.<br>And the constant crosses to Yvette Mooney for news updates was irritating on a slow news day when she had little to say.<br>BULLDOGS-Brisbane was surprisingly one-sided. But Port-Sydney on Sunday was pretty good.<br>Fremantle-Melbourne was really one for Dockers fans. The heat sucked the skills away.<br>And we hardly saw Richmond-Essendon, the game that attracted the punters (70,000 of them) and stunned the critics, who have been rating the Bombers as premiership contenders.<br>What we did get was a lot of football. And Seven has made some improvements, particularly with its goal-line camera angles.<br>There also appears to be a trend towards more analysis, giving Tim Watson, Leigh Matthews and Gerard Healy more of a say. Doug Hawkins made his expert commentator debut and seems as likeable a character as he was when court jester on the Footy Show.<br>Fourth umpire John Russo is being used well, but is it any real surprise that even he seems bewildered by about one-third of the decisions?<br>And there wasn't a scantily clad woman with a phone to be seen.<br></font></p>
