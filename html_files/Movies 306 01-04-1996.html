            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Broken Arrow (M)<br>John Travolta, Christian Slater<br>Directed by John Woo<br>THE overwhelming message from Broken Arrow is never ride in a helicopter; it will explode into a million fiery pieces as soon as look at it. Every helicopter in this exciting action film met this fate.<br>I counted four. There probably were more. They were shot down from the ground (by a revolver), knocked out by an electro-magnetic pulse (aftershock of an underground nuclear explosion) and even turned into an inferno while firmly anchored on a fast-moving train.<br>The other message from the film is to never co-star with John Travolta. He eats the scenery as Major Vic Deakins, a barking mad US Air Force pilot turned nuclear terrorist who knocks out supposed best mate Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) on a routine training flight in a Stealth bomber to steal the nuclear cargo - two warheads.<br>Travolta is cockier, more arrogant than ever. His smirk and swagger do not allow others near him on the screen. Slater as the good guy is not just second, but third, fiddle because not only is he in the presence of the powerful Travolta, but Samantha Mathis, the park ranger who comes to the stranded Riley's aid, who gives an excellent performance as a fearless yet vulnerable woman.<br>Travolta's performance lifts Broken Arrow above the ruck. And he is fortunate to be given a ride on the shoulders of director John Woo. Woo is a veteran of 20 years' film-making in Hong Kong, where he began with comedy but became famous for gangster and action violence.<br>His Eastern hand is apparent as he allows the heroes and anti-heroes of Broken Arrow many opportunities for slow-motion sweeping shots and bloodcurdling pyrotechnics.<br>Woo's enthusiasm for marrying his Eastern style with Western technology is evident. It is not every day you get a Stealth bomber, luxuriously fitted out, to swoop across and then crash into the moonscape of Utah.<br>The East-West marriage is not all that smooth, however. For an hour it is undoubtedly like silk as the action builds. Deakins steals and crashes the Stealth and he and his hired desperados grab the warheads. Hale and ranger Terry Carmichael get out of impossible tangles with a gun-toting 'copter and are hot on the Deakins gang trail.<br>But then the marriage starts rocking. Continuity is strangely lost as what seems a huge chunk of film goes missing, leaving the audience to wonder ?how did she get out of the boat ... when did they get in the train ... how did he end up here?.<br>When those questions are answered - and they can be - the film has galloped on somewhat, never missing a chance for a shootout or an horrific slow-motion death (though happily there is not too much blood).<br>It is a vital, but not fatal, flaw that interrupts enjoyment and screen-riveting attention. But nothing worse than that.<br>Deakins' motive for stealing the warheads is never clear. Is he sick of being passed over for promotion, is he so arrogant that he believes he can play God ... or does he just smoke too much (Travolta chains his way through blue packs of coffin nails).<br>Whatever the reason, Travolta is not going to let us know. He wraps all his ideas in a half-smiling, bragging charm that makes you like him even though he is threatening to kill 250,000 people in Salt Lake City at one fell swoop.<br>It might be easy to call Travolta the Bogart of the 90s. In fact, he is becoming so good in his second coming that the best description is the Travolta of the 90s.<br>He really is getting hard to touch as a big screen attraction and few actors could get away with this line: ?Please, I told you, don't shoot at the thermo-nuclear device.? He does.<br>But our own Jack Thompson as the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff does not get away with the worst American accent this decade.<br></font></p>
