            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE bronzed Aussie syndrome has been taken to ridiculous extremes by our swimmers and the strain is starting to tell. Another day at Atlanta, another bronze in the pool ... it is becoming sad and familiar.<br>The excitable Bruce McAvaney got so carried away with Australia's losing ways yesterday morning he punched the air while almost shouting something about how we would get better.<br>In the process he put the mockers on Daniel Kowalski, claiming the 200m bronze medallist would win today's 400m gold.<br>Earlier Neil Brooks had done the same to Scott Goodman in the 200m butterfly. As he, Dennis Cometti and Linley Frame of the squeaky voice were discussing the day's finals, Brooks said Goodman was ?a good thing? for the butterfly.<br>Well he wasn't bad, touched out by 0.04sec. for the silver, but the viewer was again surprised to see a superman from another country - this time Russia's Denis Pankratov - surge to a powerful, easy win, leading from start to finish.<br>Nationalism has its place, and the Games are the biggest expression of it outside war. But it doesn't hurt to know your enemy and Seven is not helping by showing predominantly Australian events.<br>Granted, this tactic might have been enjoyable if we were winning as much as head coach Don Talbot predicted.<br>But we're not. Our swimmers are making many finals and then finishing a creditable fifth or fourth - seen as a virtue yesterday morning by McAvaney.<br>What we don't see is the whole game plan, as Ms Frame seems obsessed with in her poolside chats, and thus get jolted to sobriety by rampaging Russians, New Zealanders, the Irish, and even a Belgian named Fred.<br>Day three was full of shocks, not the least the realisation that there are another 13 days of that overblown hamburger ad to endure.<br>For a start Hayley Lewis, the darling of the world championships in Perth five years ago, failed to make the final of the 400m by a long way.<br>THE Barcelona bronze medallist seems to have had her day as does US pool icon Janet Evans, the winner of four golds at two Games. Evans, who handed the torch to Muhammad Ali at the opening ceremony, missed the final too.<br>It just goes to show that swimming is a funny old game and gold just might be a big ask.<br>Actually it's amazing those two cliches have not been trotted out given the number of football commentators in Atlanta.<br>It's becoming hard to be patient with so-called live coverage that isn't and live coverage that cuts to ads and misses the goals, as in the women's hockey team's 7-1 slaughter of Argentina.<br>Also, cutting to Stan Grant at the equestrian to see, not the body of a beautiful horse, but the body of a once beautiful Bo Derek, is putting too much showbiz into sport.<br>Lift your Games, Seven, or it's the highlights for me.<br></font></p>
