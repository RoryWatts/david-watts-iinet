            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CO:: TODAY <> ONE EYED VIEW<br>AUSTRALIA'S favourite squillionaire Kerry Packer further endeared himself to all we mugs when he led a $10 million plunge on Jezabeel in this week's Melbourne Cup, earning himself at least $5 million.<br>For the second year in a row I had the same thoughts as Mr Packer regarding the likely winner . . . except I put Jezabeel in a trifecta with Persian Punch (you beaut, third) and Darazari (still running).<br>Close, but no cigar, and certainly no $5 million. Truly Mr Packer has perfected the art of punting on the cup into a science.<br>Science is not my strong suit. From high school I vaguely recall that if you immerse your homework in sulphuric acid at room temperature you will get detention.<br>And who could forget Year 8 astronomy in which pimply kiddies learn that Uranus is green.<br>This fact led to much mirth in our classroom.<br>Teacher: Smith, what colour is Uranus?<br>Smith: I'm not going to tell you unless you tell me what colour yours is, sir.<br>Class: ho, ho, ho.<br>Little did we realise that it was probably the 25th consecutive year that the science teacher had been the butt (pardon the pun) of that sort of humour. No wonder he kept a straight face and thrashed Smith.<br>But we probably had a better grip on science than the author of a BBC report about John Glenn's space shuttle mission over Perth in the wee hours of last Saturday.<br>The Beeb related how we in Perth had turned on the lights for Glenn, repeating the gesture that made him marvel from his Friendship capsule on his pioneer flight back in 1962. ?The lights show up very well,? Senator Glenn said from Discovery this time. ?Please thank everybody for turning them on, will you??<br>Then the Beeb announced that Perth left its lights on ?to provide a contrast with the surrounding desert?.<br>This ?fact? would no doubt have alarmed residents of beachside suburbs contemplating an early-morning dip, or the skippers of ships in Gage Roads who went to bed rocking atop the waves.<br>Perhaps it wasn't the science that the BBC got wrong but the geography. Told you it wasn't my strong suit.<br>But recently the magazine Omni ran a contest among its scientifically inclined readers to see who could come up with the wackiest theory. The results seem to show that among budding scientists reality is not their strong suit.<br>For example, the grand prize went to this entry:When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands with the buttered side facing down. I propose to strap buttered toast to the back of a cat. The two will hover, spinning inches above the ground. With a giant buttered cat array, a high-speed monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.<br>Among runners-up were these beauties:If an infinite number of rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number of highway signs, they will eventually produce all the world's great literary works in Braille.Why yawning is contagious: You yawn to equalise the pressure on your eardrums. This pressure change outside your eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so they must yawn to even it out.<br>But enough of such nerdiness, let's have a joke to finish.<br>Snow White received a camera as a gift and happily took pictures of the dwarfs and their surroundings. She took the film to be developed and a week later went to pick up the results. The man at the shop said the photos were not back from the processor. Snow White was disappointed and started to cry. The shop assistant tried to console her. ?Don't worry, some day your prints will come,? he told her.<br></font></p>
