            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IMAGINE for a moment that the rumours are true and Eagles coach Mick Malthouse will be on television in Melbourne next year.<br>Malthouse could walk into any number of jobs. His presence could only improve the game on television.<br>If he went to Channel 9, he could bring some sanity to the Footy Show.<br>One of his trademark glares would surely stop Eddie McGuire dominating every program with Collingwood news. And the Magpies president would not be allowed any self-indulgences such as filling air time with footage of himself in a black and white jumper kicking a goal at Victoria Park.<br>Never mind that it was a pretty good shot, it and a sequence of failed kicks took more air time than discussion of the Fremantle-Carlton game last week.<br>The Dockers again got the hurry-up treatment by being squeezed into the last minute of the show with McGuire's trademark ?just your tips please?.<br>If Malthouse decided to go to Channel 7, it would quickly lose its Channel Rex tag. Rex Hunt and impassioned self-defence such as we saw on the Footy Panel on Sunday might become a thing of the past.<br>The new Channel Mick would surely be a bit more serious about the game.<br>Jason Dunstall could step aside at Live and Kicking. With Malthouse on board, there would be no room for his clowning and brow-beating of fellow panellists.<br>Fourth umpire John Russo could take extended leave from Friday night telecasts if Malthouse joined the commentary team.<br>Can you imagine the steely, grey-haired coach putting up with an umpire rabbitting on about technicalities when there was action to be analysed?<br>The perfect position for Malthouse, however, would be on the couch next to Mike Sheahan on Talking Footy.<br>This is the place for a bit of depth, hushed tones, careful thought and often sensible talk.<br>Of course, Terry Wallace would have to go back to tending his Bulldogs fulltime. He may even be grateful that he can stop wearing two hats and be on guard in case his team is the target of too much curiosity.<br>Unfortunately, the rumours don't say that Malthouse is seeking a TV career in Perth. If they did, then the coach could pull the whip on the boys at Basil's Footy Show.<br>Karl Langdon, Adrian Barich and Scott Watters offer some parochialism to offset the Footy Show and Live and Kicking's Melbourne bias, but the panel can become over-excited.<br>It did on Sunday when guest Scott Cummings was asked to comment on video footage of the Joe Misiti-Ben Cousins incident.<br>We did not learn a lot from Cummings in the end because the rest of the panel kept interjecting.<br>By the look on his face, he seemed to share what many WA viewers thought; a feeling best summed up by Bruce McAvaney on Friday night with his call, ?It was disgraceful.?<br></font></p>
