            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet user population continues to become more mainstream, according to a recent US survey.<br>The Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press found that 41 per cent of Americans were online, compared with 23 per cent two years ago.<br>The increase in the number of users who were non-professionals, women or without tertiary education had led to a significant change in the type of content sought.<br>Two years ago technology news was the top attraction. But now the weather was the most popular online news attraction.<br>Pew, which interviewed more than 3100 people, said its survey showed that 42 per cent of US users looked for local news, up from 27 per cent in 1996.<br>One in five people now used the Net regularly to get up-to-date news and weather reports.<br>Pew concluded that the Net may be replacing television as a source of news. Heavy Internet users read newspapers and listened to the radio as much as the rest of the population, but watched TV much less.<br>A substantial minority of Internet users - 44 per cent - said they thought the Net news sites were more accurate than daily newspapers or television news programs.<br>Those using the Net for news cited three reasons: the ability to get information unavailable elsewhere, its convenience, and the ability to search for specific subjects.<br>?The popularity of general interest subjects online - from weather patterns to entertainment news - is growing much faster than that of political or international news,? Pew found.<br>An online summary of the survey claimed that the findings about an increasingly mainstream user population did not appear to reflect a trend towards social isolation.<br>?The broadening of the Internet population also casts doubt on suggestions that online activities are associated with interpersonal distrust and that the Internet attracts malcontents,? the summary said.<br>?Frequent Internet users are just as trusting of other people and the government as the average American, even when factors like age, education and income are taken into account.?<br>Pew surveys: www.people-press.org<br></font></p>
