            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE greatest thing about the World Wide Web is anyone can publish their thoughts there. The worst thing about it is . . . anyone can publish their thoughts there.<br>I searched for millennium bug reports this week. I had become slightly alarmed by news that Australia would stockpile currency in case ATMs failed on January 1, 2000, and that the British Government had advised people to make provisions for food shortages round the same time.<br>The millennium, or Year 2000, or Y2K, bug will mean older computers throughout the world will not be able to distinguish the year 2000 when it rolls along.<br>Feverish work is under way in Australia to correct the problem. The Communications Department released a progress report last week showing how far various Government departments and agencies have got in amending software so 2000 really is 2000.<br>You can read that report on the Web. Unfortunately it was the only rational writing about Y2K I saw in the two days I looked at bug reports. On the third day I was tempted to flee the country to some technologically-backward place.<br>For example: did you realise that the Y2K bug is part of a plot by the new world order - put in place by former US president George Bush, among others, during the Gulf crisis and war of 1990-91?<br>And when computers crash uniformly on January 1, 2000, and all power grids are knocked out, all banks fall flat and the streets are full of looters and rioters, that Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, will form a global government that will take away all freedoms and the sovereignty of existing nations?<br>That is a scenario agreed by at least two American Christian fundamentalists at their Web sites. One calls Y2K a ?satanic plot?.<br>The high-profile American Christian reconstructionist Gary North also goes into excruciating detail about a Y2K crisis.<br>He paints one scenario in which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shuts down atomic power plants which supply 20 per cent of the generated power in the US. This triggers a catastrophic series of events leading to bank failures and power blackouts.<br>Fundamentalists and evangelists present a strong presence on the Web through sites like the Christian Broadcasting Network and Christian Answers. They devote long examinations to Y2K which is rarely seen as anything but a calamity, requiring people to stock up on freeze-dried food, money and gold, and to get out of big population centres and lie low for the early months of 2000.<br>The American Atheists organisation has its own Web site. And why not? In the US, it seems everyone from President Bill Clinton to supermodel Cindy Crawford has one.<br>At their site, the atheists have taken a long, hard look at the fundamentalist Christian approach to Y2K. Far from just berating it as silly - because the atheists agree with much expert opinion that there ?could? be serious consequences - they wonder aloud at the continuing need for an apocalyptic vision.<br>?Given the demise of earlier apocalyptic scenarios involving the former Soviet Union and godless communism, Y2K is a convenient candidate as a touchstone for prophetic concerns,? the atheists say at the Web page, Religious Right Counting Down to Doomsday.<br>Y2K is seen as the latest candidate for the anti-Christ. Through history, that list has included Adolph Hitler, Josef Stalin, Henry Kissinger and Saddam Hussein.<br>Obviously none of this is much help to those who want to know how Y2K will really affect them. But in a world with people clever enough to weave together the Internet, you could bet there would be plenty of contingency plans under way.<br>Links:<br>Australian Government report: www.dcita.gov.au/cgi-bin/graphics.pl?path=3415<br>Y2K spiritual perspective: www.y2k.com/spiritual%20perspective.htm<br>Counting Down to Doomsday: www.atheists.org/flash.line/y2k-1.htm<br>Christian answers: www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-g008.html<br>Christian Broadcasting Network: www.cbn.org<br>Fundamentalists on Y2K at Annie's Be Prepared page: www.annieshomepage.com/bepreparedlinks.html<br></font></p>
