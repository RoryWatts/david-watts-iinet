            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Web Sights and selections of Help Desks and columns are available on the Web at www.iinet.net.au/~watto/<br>access/access.html<br>FILM<br>America's Top 100 Movies<br>afi.100movies.com/<br>home.asp<br>THE American Film Institute released its list of what are considered America's 100 greatest movies recently. The list headed by Citizen Kane and Casablanca is causing much discussion, some of it heated. The AFI site has a link to each movie and all the must-have details such as producer, director and stars. And there is also plenty of opportunity to put in your five cents worth.<br>POLITICS<br>Electoral Commission of Queensland<br>www.ecq.qld.gov.au<br>THE result of the Queensland election astounded and even shocked many. The rise of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, which captured more than 23 per cent of the primary vote, was food for thought to say the least.<br>And the uncertainty of the final outcome was as dramatic a piece of political upheaval as Australia has seen for years.<br>All of which makes what otherwise would be a fairly scholarly Web site a great place to visit. Within its many pages, the Electoral Commission of Queensland has the results of each of the 89 seats, profiles of the electorates complete with small maps, and a fascinating table of polling booth by polling booth in each electorate.<br>That way you can see where ONP made its maximum impact.<br>SOFTWARE<br>Completely Free Software<br>www.completelyfreesoftware.com<br>THIS site links to dozens of program repositories to find useful freeware for PC users.<br>Its slogan is: ?Yes there is such a thing as a free lunch.? Maybe. But if you stumble across shareware, do the right thing and register and pay the small amount asked.<br>This helps keep freeware viable, allowing software developers to use the Web as their showcase so that users and programmers alike might benefit.<br>Also ensure you have a virus checker handy. There is a lot out there and no one is guaranteeing it is all safe and wonderful.<br>On the whole, downloading freeware is usually less risky than crossing the road, however.<br>EDUCATION<br>Homework Help<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/<br>access/homehelp.html<br>THE dearly departed Access liftout ran a guide for students - and parents - earlier this year about the best places to look for help with homework on the Web.<br>We have compiled all those recommendations into the Homework Help site, hoping the list of URLs will be an easy way to look up those badly needed facts, whether they come from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the CIA or the Macquarie Encyclopedia.<br>Other guides compiled from various Help Desks and columns run by Access are also available at the Access site (www.iinet.net.au/~watto/<br>access/access.html). These Web Sights will be too ... sort of looking at yourself in a mirror looking into a mirror really.<br></font></p>
