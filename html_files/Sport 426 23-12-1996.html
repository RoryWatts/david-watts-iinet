            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BOXING Day will be a relief. True armchair critics can take a well-earned break from festivities and sink back to watch two great spectacles - the third Test at the MCG and the start of the Sydney-Hobart yacht race.<br>It is as traditional as turkey and fruit mince pies. And it is also traditional to be a little let-down after the excitement of Christmas Day and its build-up.<br>A perfect time for an argument, actually.<br>I would like to throw into the melting pot this question (and then retire gracefully to the armchair ... a bit like lighting the blue touchpaper).<br>What were the most memorable moments of television sport in 1996?<br>Here are a few ideas to get you in argumentative mood:<br>?Kieren Perkins' 1500m freestyle gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics ? everyone said he couldn't do it after just qualifying.<br>Channel 7 expert commentator Neil Brooks had written off Perkins. Brooks had been right about almost everything in the Olympic pool up to then.<br>But a record viewing audience watched in fascination and joy as Perkins showed true guts and won convincingly to confirm ? again ? his champion tag.<br>?Mark Philippoussis defeating favourite Pete Sampras at the Australian Open - it happened nearly a year ago but the US champion simply had no answer to Scud's power. The manner of the 6-4 7-6 7-6 victory in 2 hours 14 minutes was hailed as one of the outstanding performances of modern times.<br>?Tony Lockett's point after the siren - scores were tied in the historic preliminary AFL final between Sydney and Essendon at the SCG. The ball was cleared to ?Plugger? close to the 50m line. The great full forward, key to the Swans' brilliant year, pulled up his socks and with great deliberation kicked the point that the team needed to make its first grand final in more than 50 years.<br>?The Essendon jacket wavers ? the West Coast Eagles looked to be on the way to a grand final until they were humbled by arch enemy Essendon at the MCG in a semi-final many thought should have been held at Subiaco Oval.<br>With just under five minutes to go and the Bombers way in front, about 90 per cent of the 85,000 crowd started waving jackets round their heads, further rubbing salt into West Coast wounds by making coach Kevin Sheedy's triumphant gesture a tradition.<br>? Sri Lanka's World Cup cricket win ? the minnows devoured the sharks of Australia in a final watched by rapturous crowds. The entire nation of Sri Lanka celebrated in style, seeing the victory as just deserts over a country it claimed was too scared to tour there.<br>Those moments are just for starters and I would have liked to do many more, like Darren Beadman, Bart Cummings and Saintly's Melbourne Cup-Cox Plate double; Mike Clayton's funny putt; the Dockers' drubbing of Carlton, Claremont's bruising win over East Perth in the WAFL grand final thriller, and Michael Johnson's Olympic majesty.<br>There's plenty of room in the mind's eye ... but no more on paper.<br></font></p>
