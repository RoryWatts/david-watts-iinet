            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I WAS talking to a favourite GYM (gorgeous young mum) the other day about how the world had changed. This was no doubt brought about by Diana's death.<br>Unless you have been on Mars it is just about all anyone wants to talk about, beating into the shade even finals footy.<br>As they do, this conversation about Diana became sidetracked. One minute we were agreeing that it seemed appropriate one of the arrested paparazzi should be called Rat, and wondering whether England would declare war on France, the next we were discussing dentists and children's teeth.<br>It came about because of the time-honoured conversational technique of the glance skywards, shrug of the shoulders and the mumbling of the mantra becoming common to 40-pluses like the GYM and I: ?Times have changed.?<br>She then told me that when she was five, a dentist held her out the second-storey window of his surgery and told her that unless she stopped crying and carrying on he would drop her.<br>The threat obviously worked . . . she was alive to tell me for a start. And had gorgeous teeth to boot.<br>The same dentist would shave at a sink near the chair while waiting for the anaesthetic to numb the patient's mouth.<br>As this chat moved further away from the princess's sad death, I weighed in with a tale of the old days of my own.<br>When I was a billy lid, our family doctor used to smoke. Now I count several doctors as friends. None smoke. All nag me about smoking. In fact I don't know what will cause death first; the smoking or the nagging.<br>Anyway, our family doctor used to smoke, not just at his leisure, but while examining you.<br>You would go in to his surgery complaining of a ?wog? (very scientific in the old days) and he would place his hand on your tummy, stethoscope on your heart and little torch in your ear while a lit fag smoked away at the corner of his mouth.<br>My abiding memory is of his big, warm hands gently feeling for sore spots. His fingers were covered in nicotine.<br>CURED of the ?wog? I would leave his surgery with nothing worse than a racking cough and irritated eyes. The good doctor - and he was a lovely man - lived into his 80s, not giving the weed away until his 70s.<br>All this leads to a list of funny things doctors have allegedly written in their reports after examining patients.It was sent to me by a reader who will tell me only his Internet name of ?puffin? and that he is a fanatical West Perth supporter. He blames his wife and her work colleagues for collecting these:<br>By the time he was admitted, his rapid heart had stopped, and he was feeling better.<br>On the second day the knee was better and on the third day it had completely disappeared.<br>She has had no rigours or shaking chills, but her husband states she was very hot in bed last night.<br>The patient has been depressed ever since she began seeing me in 1983.<br>Discharge status: alive but without permission.<br>The patient will need disposition, and therefore we will get Dr . . . to dispose of him.<br>Healthy appearing decrepit 69-year-old male, mentally alert but forgetful.<br>The patient refused an autopsy.<br>The patient has no past history of suicides.<br>Patient has left his white blood cells at another hospital.<br>She slipped on the ice and apparently her legs went in separate directions in early December.<br>The patient experienced sudden onset of severe shortness of breath with a picture of acute pulmonary edema at home while having sex which gradually deteriorated in the emergency room.<br>The patient was in his usual state of good health until his airplane ran out of fuel and crashed.<br></font></p>
