            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS little group of Herofaxes mysteriously failed to reach Kuala Lumpur before the end of the Commonwealth Games.<br>To: Channel 9.<br>Sport: Wallowing in success.<br>Well done. If it was Australian and won gold, you captured it, overlaying the images with tasteful music and the beaming faces of Ken Sutcliffe and Ray Martin.<br>Pity you did not use Eddie McGuire and Nicole Stevenson - who actually know a bit about sport - more in the comfy chair.<br>But the ratings were on a par with the Australian gold rush. As were the platitudes about friendly locals and colourful culture.<br>You are right up there with Channel 7 in waving the flag.<br>And you did not have to put up with the discomfort of those dreadful Americans, Russians and Germans who cause Bruce McAvaney's men to look for the bronze lining at the Olympics.<br>You also helped us remember there is more to life than football at this time of the year.<br>To: Darrell Eastlake.<br>Sport: Yelling.<br>Well done Dazza, another gold. Or should I put it in your language: ?Well done you liddle bewdy, ho, ho, ho.?<br>Strange that your network previewed the weightlifting with an interview that revealed the most powerful weapon of successful lifters was between the ears.<br>Obviously that does not apply to commentators. Even London's Daily Telegraph noticed you. Last week it was moved to write: ?(When) Wales' David Morgan just failed with his gold-medal lift (Eastlake) produced the following pearl. "I've only got two words to say what he's thinking right now. What have I done'!?<br>To: Ray Warren.<br>Sport: Yelling.<br>Bad luck "Rabbit', only silver. That Eastlake is tough competition.<br>Still, you did your best. But I don't think Dennis Cometti or Neil Brooks are in any danger of being replaced as the nation's best swimming callers.<br>Also bad luck about forgetting the name of backstroke medallist Meredith Smith. It was only a bronze after all.<br>To: The word ?absolutely?.<br>Sport: All sports.<br>Well done. You have come into your own at KL.<br>It started before the opening ceremony when McGuire promised a feast of ?absolute culture?.<br>Jane Flemming loved you at the athletics, bringing out the familiar: ?The atmosphere is absolutely electric.?<br>Mike Thomson and Wally Foreman gloried over you at the hockey with ?absolute despair? and ?absolutely fantastic? at regular intervals.<br>And the New Zealand half of the commentary team at yesterday's nail-biting netball final described the court as ?absolutely chockers?.<br>Absolutely brilliant Games for you.<br>To: Retravision<br>Sport: Flogging televisions in the ad breaks<br>Well done, but could you get more than two people to call George Grljusich.<br>To: George<br>Sport: Flogging TVs etc<br>It's Betty, George.<br></font></p>
