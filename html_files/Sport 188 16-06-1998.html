            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A LOT of rubbish is spoken and written about football. Here is some more.<br>West Coast, having sneaked into third place on the AFL ladder, will finish in the top four, win at least one home final, then pip St Kilda by two points in a preliminary final after Peter Everitt is pinged for holding the ball in the last 45 seconds.<br>The Eagles will go on to be thrashed by 10 goals by Western Bulldogs in the grand final.<br>Told you it was rubbish. But then again, why not?<br>Everyone has had a say in the past week about the second half of the season.<br>But how have the television commentators fared thus far?<br>Bruce McAvaney: His love affair with Wayne Carey finally went over the top with his infamous ?I reckon Carey would have kicked that? after Chris Grant missed against West Coast.<br>However, McAvaney appears to acknowledge his own weakness and has been able to laugh about it with lines like: ?I know I'm a big Carey fan but ... ?.<br>Brings lots of enthusiasm and knowledge but Seven should ban him from North matches.<br>Dennis Cometti: Can hardly be accused of putting the dull in dulcet. Sometimes a bit too ready with the one-liners, but always flowing like the game itself.<br>Sandy Roberts: Irritating sometimes because of his ability to shout in capital letters. Even ?good evening? sounds like victory. But now and then can jazz up dull affairs.<br>Drew Morphett: Still needs to know the game better, but bright and bubbly.<br>Graham Cornes: Hoarse whisperer, whose style is better suited to Pot Black.<br>Ian Robertson: Old fashioned pie and sauce caller who is a little too keen to umpire as well.<br>John Russo: One of those good ideas at the time to have a former umpire try to explain the generally inexplicable. But he hogs too much attention. Better suited to boundary riding ... in the cold and wet of Waverley, preferably.<br>Leigh Matthews: Genuinely astute analyst if a little partial to Collingwood some days.<br>Mick McGuane: Surprise packet who often makes good sense and thinks ahead.<br>Kevin Bartlett: Finally stopped calling John Worsfold ?the smiling assassin?. Shows no signs of stopping ?the wizard? tag on Winston Abraham or Jeff Farmer.<br>Doug Hawkins: Must be laughing all the way to the bank. Likeable ... but seriously.<br></font></p>
