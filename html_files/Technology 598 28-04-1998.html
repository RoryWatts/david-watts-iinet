            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">www.award-it.com/index.html<br>You may have noticed with envy various pages literally dripping with online awards for cool or hot presentation. The Award-It! site gives surfers with home pages a chance to try to win some recognition ? albeit from fairly obscure sources. Award-It! touts itself as a one-stop registration form to apply to multiple award sites. There are 175 registered award givers, although none appear to be in the top ranks like Cool Site of the Day, or Point. Still, if you desire an award then people like 2COOLWEB, City Guide California, controversy.net, Design World or Min's Shock Zone may be your best hope. Registration at Award-It! puts your page before judges at sites like these. And, like Lotto, you've got to be in it to win it. (DW)<br>Digital Wizards<br>www.digitalwizards.com.au<br>This Perth company says it can deliver comprehensive information about Australia's most advanced range of Internet and multimedia services. Its Web site also packs some fascinating virtual reality resources. You may require plug-ins to look at the gallery of excellent shots, but do not let that put you off. The ability to zoom up and down St Georges Terrace while seated safely at your computer should not be under-estimated. Digital Wizards presents innovative photographic technology that should set minds working about ways to get more out of the Web, particularly in the area of online advertising. (DW)<br>CIA Kids Page<br>www.odci.gov/cia/ciakids/index.html<br>Do you really want to let your children near these people? I must admit on first encountering this page, I assumed it was one of the numerous satirical Web sites which mock the proud organisations which made the USA what it is today. Why, for instance, would the CIA - which recently admitted organising assasinations in foreign countries in past decades - now be interested in the welfare of your kids? The idea is chilling. This site invites you to ?try on a disguise?, gives you a lecture on the nature of military intelligence, and explains why it is so important for world leaders to know other people's secrets. There is also the excellent CIA World Factbook, in case you find yourself needing to know how many telephones there were in Andorra 15 years ago (21,258 in 1983). From the same country which brought you the Jonesboro massacre and the Muppets. (HC)<br>Listen to Triple J<br>www.abc.net.au/triplej/listen.htm<br>The ABC's youth network Triple J is running a trial of streaming live audio at this site using the Web's most essential tool, RealAudio. That means you can listen to Triple J while working at your computer, as long as you have the RealPlayer plug-in. The ABC says this site has a lot of archived audio as well. (DW)<br>Giant Steps<br>www.giantsteps.co.uk<br>This is said by The Times to be Britain's first Internet serial . . . and who are we to argue with the Thunderer. It is not due to start until May 15, but a trailer is available now if you have RealPlayer. What it reveals is a comic, sci-fi thriller in the style of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Co-writer is 36-year-old David Secombe, son of the great Goon himself, Sir Harry (known by many as Sir Cumfrence). Technology has enabled Secombe the younger to expand and build on his father's perception of radio as an aural cartoon.<br>Secombe told The Times: ?It is a genuine multimedia experience. The audio carries the dialogue but there is a world for people to get into. Around the central storyline there is a lot of space for additional sketches and gags that may be only slightly related to the main plot, but which feed into the kind of world that we have invented. We are trying to create something on the Internet that you simply couldn't do anywhere else.?<br>Giant Steps charts the bizarre events that occur when two impoverished students encounter a dubious pagan mystic - Prophet Ken, who urges his followers to ?keep watching the ground? - against a background of video piracy, a sleazy satellite television station and a secret space project. (DW)<br>CheeseNet<br>www.wgx.com/cheesenet<br>Did you know that Swiss cheese is an American invention? Or that gorgonzola was once aged in caves in order to nurture a specific type of mould? Probably not, but you can find out such interesting snippets of information at CheeseNet. The site includes an a-z list of cheeses from around the world, write-ups on each variety, wine suggestions, a history of cheesemaking and a bulletin board where you can post all your thoughts of a cheese-related nature. You can even ask Dr Cheese, the man with all the cheesy answers, and there's a handy list of links to other cheese sites. And just as a matter of interest, the semi-hard Spanish variety Aragon is made by mixing curdled sheep's milk with thistle juice and is ripened for a week in a humid environment. Bon Appetit!
