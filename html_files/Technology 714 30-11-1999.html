            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE image of the Internet as a man's world has taken some serious dents in the past few weeks.<br>First, a report from Nielsen/Net Ratings said the gender ratio in the US was now almost equal with women accounting for 49.5 per cent of all users. In 1996 only 18 per cent of users were female.<br>Recently, a survey commissioned by Women.com Networks found that 70 per cent of online women could not imagine life without Net access.<br>Women.com claimed on the basis of its research that women would rather give up their microwaves than the Net.<br>It was quoting results of a survey of women and online advertising done by Harris Interactive and Procter & Gamble.<br>Survey highlights included:<br>?The average online woman is more likely to be married than single, in her 30s, with a generally high household income.<br>?Women find micro-site marketing the most engaging and effective form of Internet advertising.<br>?More than 50 per cent of women say ?fast and easy solutions? are the key to online commerce.<br>?Women control 80 per cent of all buying decisions.<br>?Seventy-three per cent of women regularly access product and service information online.<br>?Nearly 90 per cent of women surveyed are the primary health care decision-makers.<br>The findings will let advertisers target this powerful online audience, and move them from awareness to action in an approach unrivalled on the Web today.<br>The survey split online women into six groups based on how they used the Net - explorers, breadwinners, pillars, believers, trendsetters and movers.<br>The Nielsen/Net Ratings figure of 49.5 per cent women users in the US confirms a trend noted in many online surveys in the past two years.<br>Women appear to be the fastest-growing segment of the Net population throughout the world and account for the bulk of new users.<br>Australian Bureau of Statistics figures earlier this year put Australia slightly behind the US trend with a 53-47 male-female ratio.<br>The US leads most other countries in trends on the Net. More than 47 per cent of the population - or 110 million people - are believed to be online.<br>This compares with slightly more than 30 per cent in Australia, rated one of the most wired nations in the world.<br></font></p>
