            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WITHOUT doubt, we armchair sports lovers have just witnessed one of the most important weeks of the year.<br>We have had spine-tingling penalty shoot-outs and upsets in the soccer World Cup quarter finals; witnessed the emotion of Jana Novotna, the despair of Goran Ivanisevic and the end of the Woodies' long reign at Wimbledon.<br>But there is an even more important issue to discuss.<br>And that is the continued inability of Channel 7 commentators to tell Drew Banfield and Daniel Metropolis apart. Occasionally, they throw Eagles midfielder Ben Cousins into their confusion.<br>On Saturday night, one commentator - don't know who, they all sound alike - took it one step further by calling Cousins as Ben Robbins. He used to be on the Eagles list but on the night in question he was playing for Brisbane and still has red hair and a different build from the real West Coast Benny.<br>It is Banfield and Metropolis they have the most trouble with, however. This is somewhat surprising given that Banfield is chunkier, probably better looking, never stops running and wears No.6.<br>Metropolis, on the other hand, is more wiry, pauses for what seems like 10 minutes before kicking out of defence and wears No.8.<br>A quick check of the Record might help, but perhaps the Seven boys have yet to get to grade three reading level.<br>Either Metropolis or Banfield will simply have to have a haircut or grow a beard.<br>The other solution is one that could apply to the whole AFL competition, and make the Seven boys' jobs easier: put the players' names on the back of the jumpers like they do in the National Rugby League, NBA and World Cup.<br>This idea may have been floated already. Indeed, if it was around in the 1980s it probably met a substantial stumbling block: Robert DiPierdomenico. Even his broad shoulders might have had trouble with that moniker.<br>And today it might stumble thanks to Collingwood surprise packet Simon Prestigiacomo. Oh, and of course there are two Cockatoo-Collins, Donald, of Melbourne, and Che, of Essendon. Not to mention Trent Ormond-Allen, of Adelaide, and Simon Minton-Connell, of the Bulldogs.<br>At West Coast, how would you come to grips with the two P. Materas? You could emblazon No.30 with the word Roo, and No.33 with His Brother.<br>You could do a lot of things, but it would be far easier to actually learn who was who. Spectators do it every week and we don't get paid for our comments.<br></font></p>
