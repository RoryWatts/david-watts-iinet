            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT a serious week we've had. Turmoil in Indonesia, nurses on strike, a 95-year-old woman discovered living in squalor, Microsoft accused of stinking practices, anxiety over the possibility of a GST, a Test cricket umpire accused of indecent dealing.<br>And the Cottesloe and Mosman Park under 10s were more accurate in front of goals than either the Eagles or the Dockers.<br>It is depressing . . . but only if you want it to be. As a born optimist - one who firmly believes that Elvis has just gone on a long holiday - I always try to look on the bright side.<br>To tide me over the bad news this week I dug up some lovely quotes to reassure me that life is indeed a rich tapestry.<br>Here is the gorgeous Brooke Shields, for example, saying why she should be America's anti-smoking spokeswoman: ?Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of your life.?<br>How about the equally gorgeous Mariah Carey worrying about the unfortunate: ?Whenever I watch TV and see those poor starving kids all over the world, I can't help but cry. I mean I'd love to be skinny like that but not with all those flies and death and stuff.?<br>Maybe Carey's dopey line is a bit too close to the bone, so to speak, to be considered really funny. Try this from Miss Alabama in the 1994 Miss USA contest. She had been asked the deep-and-meaningful question: ?If you could live forever, would you and why??<br>Her answer: ?I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever.?<br>Sounds perfectly logical to me, particularly when looked at in the context of the following vital information:Only one person in two billion will live to be 116 or older.<br>Such trivia is another mechanism we optimists use to stave off the forbidding seriousness of life. In fact, it was such a mega-serious week, I not only dug up the above nonsense but also found a bucket-load of trivia to jolly myself along.<br>Did you know, for instance:The name Wendy was made up for the book Peter Pan?The first toilet ever seen on television was on Leave It To Beaver?Leonardo Da Vinci invented scissors?<br>Then again trivia can be so . . . well, trivial. Optimists like to have a ready supply of jokes to cheer them as well. Like this one from goggle-eyed US comedian Rodney Dangerfield: ?A girl phoned me the other day and said, "Come on over, there's nobody home'. ?I went over. Nobody was home.?<br>Or: ?My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.?<br>Of course the greatest optimists in the world are blokes who are courting desirable young women with the eventual aim (or sentence - take it how you will) of turning them into GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums).<br>Do these blokes know what is really going on in a woman's mind? Here is what women say to blokes (and in brackets what they really mean):Can't we just be friends? (There is no way I'm going to let any part of your body touch any part of mine, again.)I just need some space. (. . . without you in it.)Do I look fat in this dress? (We haven't had a fight in a while.)I just don't want a boyfriend now. (I just don't want you as a boyfriend now.)Come here. (My puppy does this too.)I like you, but . . . (I don't like you.)You never listen. (You never listen.)<br>Whatever they said has cheered me immensely, so I'll just have a Prozac in preparation for tonight's Dockers-St Kilda match. Now that is serious.<br></font></p>
