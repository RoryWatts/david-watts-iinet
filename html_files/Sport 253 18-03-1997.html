            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONLY 10 more sleeps until footy - the real AFL season - hits Perth.<br>But we won't talk about it just yet. Let's have an argument instead.<br>The non-footy season from last October to the end of last month was awash with a staggering variety of televised sport. Here is a report card on the summer viewing:<br>Golf: Odd that a game so individual and private could make such good TV. But every network had a slice of golf and they all took viewers close to the agony and ecstasy of the players, and showed some great contests like the Australian Masters play-off won by Peter Lonard.<br>Downside was the elevation of Tiger Woods to near sainthood. He's good but has not got the runs on the board here to deserve the fawning practised by some commentators - eight out of 10<br>Soccer: You could screen soccer 24 hours a day and not cover it properly. Perth viewers were lucky to have SBS, in particular, and the ABC.<br>Country soccer lovers would feel cheated because they rarely see more than the English Premier League which has been ?Rupert Murdoched? into a package of ritzy highlights.<br>Still, they are terrific highlights, and SBS with On the Ball and World Soccer can, at times, live up to its nickname Soccer Bloody Soccer - seven out of 10.<br>Racing: The spring carnival from Melbourne was excellent on Channel 10, but less so on 9 where the network's so-called personalities intruded on events - six out of 10.<br>Tennis: For every lively, tail-swishing filly like Martina Hingis, there seem to be a dozen boring baseliners who drag tennis coverage to excess boredom levels.<br>The quality of good matches and the drama of Melbourne's heatwave saved 7's Australian Open coverage. The ABC tried hard with the Hopman Cup, but when will all tennis commentators stop calling the players by their first names, making them sound like best friends? - six out of 10.<br>Test cricket: Viewers now see much more than any player could hope to. The problem is in balancing gimmickry and cricket. Nine just made it, allowing Australia's 3-2 win over the West Indies to dominate. Seven's late showing of Foxtel coverage from South Africa is better. There is no endless flogging of Channel 9 paraphernalia and no Bill Lawry or Tony Greig; just good camera work and Denis Cometti - six out of 10.<br>One-day internationals: Full of gimmickry and hype. The blather of Lawry and Co. was heard in lounge rooms far too much. - four out of 10.<br>Gridiron: The ABC and Don Lane dropped the ball for Nine and Eddie Maguire; what a mistake. Lacked pizzaz, was on far too late and Darren Bennett should stick to kicking - four out of 10.<br>Baseball : The Heat won, but who saw it? - two out of 10.<br>Special mention: Channel 10 for triathlon, cycling, surfing, racing, golf, motorsport, the NBA and even indoor cricket. Ten still leads the free-to-air pack in trying to provide a half-decent nightly wrap of all sporting news - eight out of 10.<br>David Watts can be contacted via e-mail: watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
