            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS easy to pick the non-believers among groups of middle-aged WA men during the European winter.<br>Just say the words ?Bobby Moore? and those with tears in their eyes will reveal themselves as English soccer fans.<br>Moore was the West Ham and England legend who played a major part in the World Cup victory over Germany at Wembley Stadium 30 years ago.<br>He is held in the type of reverence Australians reserve for Don Bradman, Polly Farmer and Phar Lap.<br>These ?non-believers? have some of the best television sport available to viewers in Australia. The English Premier League on the ABC on Monday nights, repeated on Saturday afternoons, is one of the tightest, action-packed sport shows on offer. In fact, any sport lover would find it attractive.<br>But the game has changed since the glory days of Bobby Moore. Now, to elicit passions from a younger generation of soccer followers, you need to say names like Cantona, Vialli, Schmeichel, Bosnich or even Emerson.<br>You see the United Nations appears to have moved from New York and relocated to Highbury, Anfield, St James's Park ? any venue where the Premier League is played in front of big crowds.<br>The flood of European and South American stars to the playing fields of England began as a trickle several years ago. Now, as the greatly revamped former division one attracts big crowds, top TV coverage and even bigger wads of money, the clubs have opened their cheque books.<br>And the supporters have opened their minds to accept different nationalities and different styles which are contributing to a thrilling competition.<br>Just as the draft appears to have evened up the AFL, the multicultural trend in England appears to have evened up their competition.<br>For example, Manchester United, always pacesetters, had to settle for a draw against lowly Derby in the main match featured last week. Playing at consistently high level obviously draws the talent out from what seem like the humblest clubs.<br>Unfashionable Wimbledon is even jousting for top spot with the rich boys of Arsenal. Asked if the club could pull off the seemingly impossible and win the championship, one of the Wimbledon lads allegedly replied: ?Nah, Mike Tyson will win it back?.<br>???<br>CHANNEL 9 can be terrific one day and infuriating the next. Excellent coverage of the poor West Indies being humbled by Australia A on Friday was followed on Saturday by an American show about great sporting rivalries.<br>This sort of show could be fertile ground if produced locally. Think of the possibilities ? Collingwood v Melbourne, Queensland v NSW rugby league, Australia v England at cricket, and even Australia v New Zealand at netball.<br>But what did we get? The Dodgers v the Yankees at baseball.<br></font></p>
