            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WINDOWS 98 is making an impact on the Net less than a fortnight after its public release, but it is not the sort that Microsoft would want.<br>Complaints about a wide variety of perceived glitches in the upgraded operating system are rolling in to various newsgroups, along with floods of whinges and queries to Web sites specifically set up to provide user help.<br>The cnet News.com site reported late last week that Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and others including IBM and Toshiba, were posting workarounds, fixes and warnings on their Web sites about upgrading to Windows 98.<br>Upgrade glitches were not specific to Dell and Compaq but affected all vendors in some way, the report said.<br>Dell is advising users that the new features in Windows 98 will require, for some models, a new set of drivers - the critical software that allows hardware devices to talk to Windows.<br>In some cases, a BIOS update might also be needed. BIOS is the software that configures a computer in the starting, or boot-up, sequence immediately after the PC is turned on.<br>The newsgroup, microsoft.public.win98.pre-release, was set up several months ago to deal with the big number of users worldwide who either had beta or pre-release versions of Windows 98. Posts to the group have doubled since the public release on June 25. Questions on installation problems and FAT32 conversion of disks have dominated since then.<br>A growing number of queries relate to the compatibility of other programs with Windows 98. In many cases, problems are solved by following recommendations from other users who respond to posted queries.<br>A similar philosophy is at work at the Windows 98 Annoyances site on the Web, set up in March as an offshoot of the popular Windows 95 Annoyances pages.<br>Annoyances relies heavily on users to post workarounds and fixes to common problems.<br>Topics covered include: reducing clutter, customising, performance, troubleshooting, networking and third-party annoyances. A special section even deals with funny stories about users' experiences.<br>One of the highlighted sections at Annoyances is a description of how to remove the integration of the Internet Explorer 4.0 browser and the operating system. This integration is a key sales point of 98, allowing users to view their PC's operations as if they were browsing the Web.<br>It is also a key point of the US Department of Justice suit against Microsoft - due to be heard in September - which alleges Microsoft is anti-competitive because it ties the browser with its OS.<br>Annoyances gives users the chance to download a small program called ie-off which stops the OS using the browser as its main interface. The operation can be reversed, and Annoyances admits many users probably bought 98 because of the browser bundling and may not want to lose it.<br>Other help sites include Microsoft's own which allows users to search a database but can be slow, the Communique magazine site and Windows Magazine.<br>Help Desk<br>News.com:<br>www.news.com<br>newsgroup:<br>microsoft.public.win98.pre-rel 98 Annoyances:<br>www.annoyances.org/win98/<br>Windows 98 official sites:<br>www.windows98.com.au<br>www.microsoft.com/windows98/default. help:<br>www.cmq.com.au/commun/technophile/<br>index.asp<br>Windows Magazine:<br>www.winmag.com<br></font></p>
