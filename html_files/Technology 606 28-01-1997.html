            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT continues to make inroads into Netscape's domination of the World Wide Web browser market.<br>Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 was released officially for both Macintosh and Windows3.x recently, meaning it is now available on all three most commonly used computer platforms.<br>Netscape can be used on 15 operating systems, but the percentage of Web surfers who do not use Windows95, NT, 3.x, or Macs is very low. Survey group Browserwatch puts the figure around 6 per cent - mostly on Unix systems.<br>So MSIE3.0 can now be compared on almost equal terms with Netscape's Navigator, which last year enjoyed more than 80 per cent of market share, according to software analysis group Interse.<br>Interse's monthly figures comparing Web browser use put MSIE's share at 33 per cent compared with Navigator's 54.4 per cent for December.<br>MSIE's figure has risen nearly two points since November while Navigator's is down more than five.<br>Interestingly, the category of ?other browsers? in December was responsible for 12.6 per cent of hits at Interse-monitored sites. This is a rise of more than three points since November, the best in that category for more than a year.<br>?Other browsers? include Web pioneer NCSA Mosaic, which has refused to lie down and has just released a new version 3.0 of its own for Windows95. WestWeb hopes to test drive Mosaic in the next few weeks.<br>Browserwatch has MSIE even closer to Navigator. In its latest survey figures, released on January 21, Browserwatch says Navigator accounted for 45 per cent of hits at its Web sites and MSIE 42.5 per cent.<br>Browserwatch says 46 per cent of surfers use a Windows system and 27 per cent operate with Macs, meaning MSIE will go even closer to top spot in the near future.<br>About 200,000 hits from browsers were analysed.<br>Netscape fared much better at the Webtrends survey site. Its latest figures, after analysing more than 1.5 million browser visits, gave Navigator 69.7 per cent share against MSIE's 27.4.<br>It appears users surveyed at Interse are upgrading to the latest versions of MSIE and Navigator very quickly. A total of 78 per cent of Navigator users browsed Interse sites with version 3.0 in December, the same figure as in November but up 16 points on October.<br>Last month Interse recorded 4 per cent of Netscape users trying the new version 4.0 beta, or Communicator.<br>Microsoft, which offers MSIE3.0 free, has even keener upgraders.<br>In December, Interse recorded 91 per cent use of version 3.0, a steady growth since the official release in September.<br>The release of version 3.0 beta last April-May caused version 2.0 use to drop from 73 to 26 per cent.<br></font></p>
