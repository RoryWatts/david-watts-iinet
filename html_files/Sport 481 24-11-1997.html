            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE couch potatoes love our heroes. So last week when Peter Matera decided to stay with the Eagles I, like many one-eyed West Coast followers, could barely contain my joy.<br>Straightaway I sent a fax to my mate Bill. It had a picture of Matera and the words ?Bill, you know I would never leave you, love Peter?.<br>Like me, Bill thinks the sun shines out of Matera's you-know-where.<br>If the champion Eagle had done nothing more after kicking that goal on the run from the boundary in the 1992 grand final, he would still have been a superstar.<br>But of course he has done plenty. Often, it seems Matera is the only reason the Eagles remain competitive.<br>His dash and evasion from the back pocket have helped change the course of many games.<br>At the night game against Carlton at Subiaco this year I sat near a man who, though decked out in full Eagles clobber, could easily have passed for a Blues barracker.<br>You know the type. Everything West Coast did was met with derision. ?Get some skills Bluey. You've lost it Woosha - ahhh Drew, you're not good enough. Keep on walking Chad, right off the field.?<br>He didn't even join the mandatory booing of Greg Williams, so I thought he might be an enemy plant.<br>However, when Matera lifted - as he nearly always does - this joker yelled: ?Does this bloke have to do everything? I don't know why he bothers sometimes.?<br>Thus he revealed himself a true Eagle - not your textbook flag-waver, but one who knew a champion at least. Not every football follower shares this near reverence for Matera, though.<br>More than a few hurtful arrows have been fired in various forums on the Internet.<br>The Eagles have their own site on the World Wide Web with a discussion area that allows anyone, even Collingwood and Hawthorn fans, to put in their 20 cents worth in the form of e-mail messages.<br>One appeared under the heading ?Matera is garbage? and said: ?I don't know why one team let alone two would want that uncoordinated ugly chicken in their side.? It was posted by someone using the nickname Collingwood Boy.<br>It provoked immediate replies, including this: ?For your information, Peter Matera is a skilled player and better than any of the excuses for players that Collingwood has produced. I bet that if Peter Matera played for the Magpies then you would love him too. Oh, and by the way BEN COUSINS RULES.?<br>Elsewhere, in a discussion group devoted to football and which has the air of a pub in a constant state of post-match debate, the electronic conversation went like this: ?Peter Matera will be staying with the Eagles for at least the next four years.<br>?Melbourne players should expect a decent pay rise now that there's plenty of room left below the salary cap.?<br>One response: ?Funny, I always thought that you had to play well to get a pay rise.?<br>There is no accounting for taste.<br></font></p>
