            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE problem with the World Wide Web is that it is a great forum for vanity, boasting and self promotion.<br>How many geeks out there with all-singing, all-dancing home pages are really incompetent at everyday things?<br>But when it comes to the arcane practice of hyper text formatting, they are jets. They can whip up a home page with a blinking, colour headline and graphics to die for ... and be the millionth person to start with Yahoo.<br>For every one of these show-offs, there is a newbie, frustrated by their service provider's home page, which may take an age to load and in the end tells them little ... except where to find Yahoo. The answer lies in the newbie's passion for bookmarks.<br>Making a bookmark creates a hyper text-formatted entry in a read-only file called bookmark.htm. With my service provider this file resides in c:\internet\www.<br>By opening the options button on a Netscape browser and clicking on preferences, and then going to font and style, you can change your home page to c:\internet\www\bookmark.htm, so that every time you enter the World Wide Web there are your bookmarks.<br>The inquisitive will want to examine bookmark.htm and learn more. By copying (save as) bookmark.htm, you can create a file that can be edited and have a look at hyper text machine language in the raw.<br>Pretty soon you will want to know more about hyper text formatting, so you can join the internauts.<br>Kevin Werbach's barebone. txt is a simple, painless introduction. It is available at: http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/barebone.html.<br></font></p>
