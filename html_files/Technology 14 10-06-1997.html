            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Want to download a file from the Net and get it fast? DAVID WATTS examines FTP programs.<br>One of the less visually attractive parts of the Net is FTP, or File Transfer Protocol. It does not have the seductive animation nor random surprise of the World Wide Web, nor the intimacy of e-mail nor the spunky attitude of IRC. But boy is it useful.<br>FTP is most commonly used to download software or update Web sites. Every program I have seen relies on straight, no-nonsense directory-structured interfaces that enable users to simply click on files to either download or upload. In essence, it is as simple as that.<br>So it is interesting to see that such a simple function is attracting plenty of interest from software developers who you think might be lured by the attraction of HTML editors or push technology agents.<br>The fact is there has been a recent outbreak of new FTP software. Whether it has actually added functionality or choice is debatable.<br>Two old favourites for the PC - CuteFTP and WS-FTP - are still hard to beat despite the emergence of some good-looking newcomers which have been inspired by the Windows 95 user interface.<br>Most prominent among these newcomers are FTP Explorer and FTP Voyager. Both interfaces replicate the Windows 95 Explorer file manager, which enables users to copy, move and delete, among other things.<br>Voyager has the handy option of drag and drop.<br>Explorer enables users to restart a file transfer where they left off if a previous FTP function is interrupted. Neither show users their own hard drive's file structure during a Net session and this is their big downfall.<br>The advantage of CuteFTP and WS-FTP is that they start a connection to an FTP site with a window showing the contents of directories on your hard drive.<br>Both programs use the left window to show this directory while the right window shows the directory of the FTP site connected to.<br>Although this is of only little importance when downloading a game, say, it is vital when uploading files to a Web site. The user can manipulate files on their own drive with ease and compare them with uploaded files at the Web site.<br>CuteFTP has the edge in functionality because of its uncluttered look and easily followed commands. It can also resume interrupted transfers, which is useful if you are an unlimited account user and your provider cuts you off unexpectedly midway through a download. WS-FTP has been around longer and still looks like a slightly complicated Unix shell, although a few sessions reveals it is quite easy to use.<br>Mac users should consider Anarchie, which has an elegant drag-and-drop interface, or Fetch, which is somewhat less powerful feature-wise.<br></font></p>
