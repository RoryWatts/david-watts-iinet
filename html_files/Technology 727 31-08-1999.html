            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FLYING visit by an American lawyer helped throw the spotlight back on the Federal Government's Internet censorship legislation last week.<br>Lawyer Nadine Strossen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the legislation made Australia a global village idiot - terminology used by free speech campaigners Electronic Frontiers Australia at the height of the censorship row in June.<br>The comment by Ms Strossen - Professor of Law at New York Law School - angered Communications Minister Richard Alston.<br>But it brought agreement from Opposition communications spokesman Stephen Smith who raised concerns about the laws after the full release by the Australian Broadcasting Authority of the three-nation survey into community attitudes on the Net.<br>Senator Alston, the chief architect of the law due to come into force on January 1, said Ms Strossen's comment was an example of the arrogant disdain shown by some visiting experts.<br>?Australia is not the United States. Australians believe that promotion of individual freedoms must be balanced by the wider social good,? Senator Alston said.<br>He claimed Australians were proud of the new censorship legislation. It sought to balance freedom of expression with protection of community standards.<br>?Does she (Ms Strossen) seriously believe that material which is illegal offline - such as bomb recipes, paedophile lists and incitement to racial violence - should be permitted on the Internet in the interests of freedom of speech, a freedom which is rightly constrained in other media?? Senator Alston said.<br>He denied claims by Ms Strossen that the legislation would allow whoever was enforcing the law to inject their own values into it, saying it was based on an established classification system.<br>And he hit out at comments by Ms Strossen that the legislation would be unworkable because there was no effective filtering tool.<br>?Does this mean that she favours the repeal of any law that is difficult to enforce - whether it deals with illicit drugs, drink driving or workplace safety??<br>The ABA's release of the survey into community attitudes prompted Mr Smith to attack the censorship legislation.<br>He said the Government should rethink its laws, which he described as over the top.<br>The ABA survey findings showed that Australians were vitally interested in the content of the Net.<br>However, the findings were based on attitudes and said nothing about the workability of the Government's laws.<br>?It is clear that many in the industry and the community believe that the legislation will have an adverse impact on Australia's growing Internet industry,? Mr Smith said.<br>?Some analysts have predicted that the total cost of complying with the legislation could be as high as $150 million. This will have serious implications for smaller Internet service providers, particularly those in rural or regional areas, who already operate on low margins.?<br></font></p>
