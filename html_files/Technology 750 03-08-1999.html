            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LOTTO, the Internet and e-commerce ... it could be a potent cocktail. Perth marketing engineer John Wiese is using a passion for Lotto and his computing background to see what happens when he mixes those three elements together.<br>Mr Wiese, 28, has developed a Java program called OWN Lotto which in its basic form is free to any Net user who visits his Web site.<br>Those users can pay $5 for a one-year membership of OWN Lotto which gives them an enhanced version of the software.<br>Mr Wiese's site is designed to provide Lotto results, statistics and free analysis software to help users pick winning numbers.<br>OWN Lotto works straight from the browser window. It allows users to input their choice of numbers. The software then lets users check their numbers to see how frequently they have been drawn.<br>Initial reaction to the program has surprised Mr Wiese. He launched what is still a personal site in May. Since then traffic has doubled each month and it is now in the top 6 per cent of most visited member sites hosted by Perth ISP iiNet.<br>It is also the number one result produced by Excite when searching for the words ?lotto systems?.<br>Whether OWN Lotto can make Mr Wiese a virtual Lotto winner himself is the big question.<br>He believes the earning potential of a product such as his on the Web is unknown.<br>?Companies like Amazon.com have become multi-million-dollar ventures in a few short years ... check back with me in 12 months,? he said in an e-mail interview.<br>His first goal is to take his site to a commercial level by gaining more advertising revenue and membership subscriptions.<br>He believes this will improve site performance and eliminate Web site traffic restrictions.<br>Mr Wiese has been a Net user since the medium was in its infancy. He used it for e-mail when studying for a Bachelor of Science at the University of WA.<br>With a double major in computer science and information technology and lots of practical experience in the IT profession, he has dabbled in writing shareware programs over the past few years, but says he has had little financial success.<br>?Web site development seemed the next logical step and I'm seeing immediate results,? he said. ?My philosophy is "success is for those who want it enough'.?<br>He wrote the OWN Lotto program in two months during spare time away from work. Originally it was a personal Java application.<br>?It then occurred to me to Web-enable the software, and this in my opinion proved one of the strengths of Java,? he said. ?It took less than an hour to convert OWN Lotto into an applet that could be run from a Web page.? His wife, Yvonne, helped with graphic design.<br>The software was developed on standard PC hardware using Sun's free Java compiler and a free HTML editor. Web-site hosting was the only real expense.<br>?OWN Lotto is written in pure Java to improve portability-compatibility. This just goes to show that Web development can be cheap if you have a winning idea, the skills to implement that idea, and the time and desire to see it through,? Mr Wiese said.<br>The free version shows users different graphs that chart the probability of their numbers being picked. Results are based on the frequency with which numbers are picked.<br>The enhanced - or members' - version adds weeks since numbers were last drawn to its analysis of chances.<br>Mr Wiese's SmartPick software for OWN members draws on chaos theory and linear geometry to help number selection. ?Chaos theory dictates that minor changes can cause huge fluctuations. Thus I apply a degree of chaos (a random effect) to the initial state, and each bounce of the ball used to select numbers,? Mr Wiese says.<br>OWN Lotto:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~wiesejv/own/index.html<br></font></p>
