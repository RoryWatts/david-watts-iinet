            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CONTACT h h h 12<br>For the first hour Contact is as good as any film you're likely to see this year. Director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) so skilfully introduces us to Dr Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) and her obsession with finding signs of extraterrestrial life that, when she did, I was ready to sign up for a stint on the MIR space station. But after Ellie and the other scientists start decoding the messages and mankind sets about building a space transporter that will take a man (or, in the case of this high-priced star vehicle, a woman) to the edges of the universe, Contact moves along at the speed of light, making the kind of ludicrous leaps you'd expect of B-grade sci-fi fantasy. The ship is constructed seemingly overnight, an all-powerful billionaire (John Hurt) starts popping up everywhere, even orbiting earth and the search for a suitable person to represent all of humanity on the space flight is boiled down to a simple Q & A session. Even sillier is the casting of Matthew McConaughey as the US president's spiritual adviser. Would you take spiritual guidance from a guy who looks like Don Johnson? Ironically, McConaughey wanders through a $100 million movie warning of the dangers of technology. And what universe-shaking truth does Ellie discover on the other side of the universe? That all we need is love. That's a half a trillion dollars and 26 light years to learn something we could have got off the back of an old Beatles album. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE FULL MONTY H H H12<br>There's nothing too flash in this cheeky, one-joke comedy about a group of unemployed steelworkers who, out of desperation, are determined to become Sheffield's answer to the Chippendales. Writer Simon Beaufoy and director Peter Cattaneo attempt to give their story a bit of meat, so to speak, by dealing with the shattered personal and professional lives of the lads but it's not especially convincing. Audiences, however, don't seem to give a fig leaf: all they want to see is a bunch of less-than-average blokes get their clobber off. Gym owners across the globe must be shaking in their Nikes. For a full review see Arts Today page 5. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>TOUCH H H12<br>Paul Schrader, despite his perennial interest in spiritual matters, is the last person you'd expect to adapt Touch, Elmore Leonard's 1987 comic novel about a stigmatic with miraculous powers. As a screenwriter (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) and director (American Gigolo, The Comfort of Strangers, Light Sleeper) Schrader is known for his cerebral, highly serious approach, while Leonard's books are boisterous, scrappy affairs with pungent dialogue and deliciously oddball characters. Schrader makes a fair stab at translating Leonard to the big screen, sticking closely to the book and putting together a delightfully eccentric cast (including Christopher Walken, Janeane Garofalo and Giana Gershon). However, Schrader doesn't quite get into the spirit of Leonard's satirical fable about fundamentalist religion, greed and tabloid television. It has plenty of funny moments, especially those involving Tom Arnold as the buffoonish leader of OUTRAGE (Organisation Unifying Traditional Rights As God Expects), but Schrader treats the stigmatic Juvenal (a nice Johnny Depp-like Skeet Ulrich) and his lover (Bridget Fonda) so straight that in the end we're left confused about the whole point of the movie. Hopefully, Quentin Tarantino will do a better job adapting Rum Punch (retitled Jackie Brown), his keenly awaited follow-up to Pulp Fiction. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BREAKDOWN H H H 12<br>First-time director Jonathon Mostow taps into all kinds of middle-class fears in this pared-to-the-bone thriller about a Massachusetts couple who become separated when their fancy new Jeep breaks down on a deserted road in the American West. Unfortunately, all mystery and Hitchcockian menace, given mythic dimension by the Monument Valley settings, evaporate the moment Jeff solves the riddle of his wife's disappearance and Breakdown turns into a Duel-inspired non-stop action-thriller. It's wonderfully well-crafted with the tension cranked to an almost unbearable level but it would've been nice if Mostow had spent a little more time on Jeff's struggle to convince the grizzled natives what has happened rather than on jaw-dropping truck stunts, no matter how sensational. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BUDDY H H H<br>Based on Animals Are My Hobby, the autobiography of eccentric New York socialite Gertrude ?Trudy? Lintz, Buddy is the story of one woman's passion for animals and her quest to raise a baby gorilla. Instead of enjoying the roaring 20s, Trudy Lintz (an elegant Rene Russo) risked social ridicule by surrounding herself with a menagerie of champion dogs, a troupe of cheeky chimps and Buddy, the hand-raised gorilla who soon grew into a handful that no lock or chain could contain. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>THE DAYTRIPPERS H H H H<br>Greg Mottola has come up with some pretty funny ideas and sharp observations about family relationships in his debut comedy-drama about a working class family who drive from their Long Island home into Manhattan to search for an errant husband (played by the wonderful Stanley Tucci of Big Night fame). There are some well-realised and often very funny scenes in the car, and the witty script pushes them around the city with a rising sense of frustration and tension. Daytrippers is an impressive debut, rich in detail despite its low budget. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>DOING TIME FOR PATSY CLINE H H H 12<br>Australian writer-director Chris Kennedy goes country and western in this quirky tale about a young man's wish fulfilment on the road to Nashville. Engaging performances from Miranda Otto, Richard Roxburgh and Matt Day enliven what is already a vibrant combination of fantasy, romantic comedy, road movie and prison drama. The elements fuse together rather neatly as the trio crosses the Australian countryside, only to land in prison where the men must share the cells with a trio of musically limited desperadoes. Nominated for 10 AFI Awards. At the Luna. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>EVENT HORIZON H H H<br>Sam Neill tears his eyes out in Event Horizon, a sci-fi fantasy which unexpectedly mutates into schlock horror, and by the end you might be tempted to do the same. For about an hour it looks like a fairly respectable attempt to explore cutting-edge ideas in quantum physics, with a rescue ship (skippered by Laurence Fishburne) trying to find out what happened to the deep space research vessel Event Horizon. But when the crew start taking to each other with meat cleavers (meat cleavers on a space ship?) you begin to realise what lies beyond the event horizon is, along with all those missing socks, nothing more than leftover bits from B-grade slasher movies. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>EXILE IN SARAJEVO H H H H<br>An intriguing example of the new breed of subjective documentary in which the film-making process becomes as much a part of the story as its purported real subjects, the citizens of the besieged city of Sarajevo. The result is at once deeply moving and intellectually challenging, in which every image of a bleeding corpse, severed limb or a grieving mother is juxtaposed with searching personal, political or philosophical question. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE GAME H H H 12<br>Michael Douglas is perfectly cast in this machine-tooled thriller about a fabulously wealthy control-freak financier whose life is turned upside down when he's drawn into a deadly fantasy game in which there are no rules and no object. While it's somewhat mechanical and the Douglas character's redemption a little too neat, director David Fincher (Seven) toys with enough good ideas about power, manipulation and paranoia to keep us on our toes. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE H H H H<br>This live-action version of the popular 60s cartoon about a Tarzan-like nature boy (Brendan Fraser), who's a few bananas short of a full bunch, is the most swinging family picture of the year. Hip, delightfully self-referential and featuring a gorilla singing I Did It My Way in a Las Vegas show, George in the Jungle is wonderful, chest-beating fun. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>FREE WILLY 3: The Rescue H H<br>This latest adventure about a killer whale named Willy is sparked by its two young stars but it is otherwise dull and tedious. Jesse (again played by Jason James Richter) has a summer job tracking the declining whale population aboard a research vessel with his mentor Randolph (August Schellenberg, also reprising). Meanwhile, 10-year-old Max (Vincent Berry) is going to sea for the first time with his father, John, captain of a salmon fishing boat. John's key source of income is from the illegal slaughter of whales for sale to countries where whale meat is a delicacy. Rated PG (Kevin Thomas - LA Times)<br>HERCULES H H H 12<br>The critics have joined forces with the Greek Government to fling sharp-tipped javelins at Hercules, but the real target audience, the kids, gave it a big thumbs-up at the preview. They seemed to care little that Disney's 35th animated feature veers wildly from the original myth and the muscle-bound mortal's 12 mountainous labours, enjoying instead the range of wise-cracking characters (voiced by James Woods, Danny DeVito and Bobcat Goldthwaith among others) that make this lively entertainment, not a slavish retelling of an epic tale. Rated G (David Watts)<br>KISS OR KILL H H H<br>Australian writer-director Bill Bennett has thrown off all the usual trappings (script, music soundtrack, tripod, continuity editing) to give this story about a pair of sexy con artists on the run from the law and a psychopathic former footy star an energy and pace rare in local movies. Unfortunately, the plot overheats well before reaching its destination, stranding its talented leads Frances O'Connor and Matt Day in the middle of nowhere. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING H H H H<br>It is a relief to finally see Julia Roberts back on track in this warm, witty and hugely romantic comedy about a woman who sets out to break up the impending marriage of her former boyfriend. Roberts literally bumbles her way through the film, falling off beds, splitting seams and cooking up crazy, mean and downright stupid ideas in a last-ditch attempt to win back Michael (a sadly uncharismatic Mulroney). But she has a brilliant co-conspirator in her gay English editor George, played with panache by Rupert Everett. Very silly at times but a treat to watch just the same. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN H H H<br>Directed by Sydney Lumet, who has visited this precinct before (The Verdict, Prince of the City), Night Falls on Manhattan deals with a young assistant district attorney (Andy Garcia) who is pulled into a major investigation of corruption in the New York Police Department after his veteran cop father (Ian Holm) is badly wounded in a drug bust. This sounds like the set-up for an action-packed thriller; however, Lumet is more concerned with psychology and ethics, digging into the souls of men who exist in the shadow between guilt and innocence. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>PAWS H H H<br>Teenage blues guitarist Nathan Cavaleri does a plausible job in this far-fetched story of an incredibly smart dog named PC (voice supplied by a very funny Billy Connolly) who manages to toy with a computer's voice emulation software so he too can ?speak?. Younger children might find the slightly morbid opening and the villainous Anya (Sandy Gore) a bit on the creepy side but there's plenty of feel-good family mush in there to balance it. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>A SIMPLE WISH H H 12<br>The idea of a failed male fairy godmother named Murray trying and mostly mucking up attempts to grant a young girl her wish that her dad get the leading role in a Broadway musical is a good one. But it needs more than just loopy facial expressions from Murray (played by Martin Short), or bolshie cuteness from Anabel (Mara Wilson of Mrs Doubtfire fame) to make it work. For a film about magic A Simple Wish lacks too much of it. Rated G (David Watts)<br>SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL H H 12<br>Jan De Bont virtually redefined the action movie with his devilishly wicked surprise hit about a booby trapped bus set to explode if it dropped below a certain speed. Unfortunately, trying to recapture the edge-of-the-seat thrills of Speed by setting it on a cruise ship in the Caribbean was not such a bright idea. Also, the charmingly natural Sandra Bullock is cut adrift far too early, with the rather wooden Jason Patric taking the wheel. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>ULEE'S GOLD H H H H<br>There's something truly eerie about seeing Peter Fonda cast as the patriarch of a family being torn apart by drug problems. Here we have one of the key symbols of the 60s, the generation which was responsible for introducing casual drug taking into mainstream American life, playing a character trying to pull his wretched, strung-out daughter-in-law from the clutches of low-life scum. I'm not sure how conscious was the casting of Fonda as Ulee Jackson, a Vietnam veteran who has found emotional refuge in the gentle rhythms of bee-keeping, but it's mightily effective. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BRASSED OFF H H H<br>There's much to like in this stirring British comedy-drama about a mine closure that threatens the future of a long-standing colliery brass band, especially the heartfelt performance of Pete Postlethwaite as the band's leader, Danny. But writer-director Mark Herman avoids the really interesting questions, such as the logic of supporting a filthy business that's sending Danny to an early grave, choosing instead to wallow in working-class sentiment. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>FACE/OFF H H H H<br>After the relative disappointments of Hard Target and Broken, John Woo has finally pulled off an American picture which captures the hyperbolic high style and bloody poetry of his best Hong Kong work. Woo also pushes his signature theme - that all men have the capacity for good and evil in them - into dizzying new territory by having the antagonists (played by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage) swap faces. The result is, quite simply, the most outrageously entertaining movie experience of the year. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br></font></p>
