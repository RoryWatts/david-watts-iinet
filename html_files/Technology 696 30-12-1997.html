            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A popular saying of this last part of the 20th century is ?get a life?. Roughly, it means do something useful for yourself. In the last couple of weeks, dozens of WA Internet users have been thrashing out the issue of whether one can ?get a life? in front of a computer screen.<br>The catalyst for this lively discussion has been the move by the State's biggest Internet service provider, iiNet Technologies, to volume and time charging. iiNet's 10,000 customers have been paying between $25 and $35 a month for unlimited access to the Net.<br>But faster technologies have meant bigger downloads by some, forcing iiNet's costs up. The ISP estimates 5 per cent of users account for more than 40 per cent of costs. These 5 per cent are said to be connected for about six hours a day every day and to be downloading around 300Mb on average a month.<br>iiNet proposed that a 250Mb a month download cap be imposed and that use be capped at 200 hours for the same period. Restrictions on access would apply after those limits had been reached.<br>The proposals have unleashed mountains of messages to the iinet.general newsgroup. Most have simply discussed whether this is the fairest method of charging or whether anything needs to change at all.<br>But one discussion thread opened up a much bigger window and went to the heart of a different matter ? is life online really life?<br>The discussion opened with this: ?What strikes me is the number of hours we are talking about. 120 hours a month works out to be roughly four hours a day. That is four hours every day after day after day. Don't people ever get sick of it? What ever happened to playing sports, going to the movies? What ever happened to socialising IN PERSON? Some people really should get a life.?<br>A long response to this made some interesting counter-points. On sport: ?I was never good at sport ? but why should we do something we're not good at and don't enjoy? Computers, on the other hand ??<br>Socialising: ?Some people don't fare too well socialising in person. This could be because they think they look ugly, because they stutter, because they aren't comfortable with person to person Real Life conversations, because they sound bad, bad case of halitosis ? all sorts of reasons.?<br>The writer went on with a simple but perceptive explanation of the popularity of parts of the Net: ?So I go IRCing or Java Chatting or ICQing. When you do this, you don't see the person you're talking to ? It makes me a hell of a lot more comfortable about talking to people.?<br>And to top it off, some very logical talk about the influence of the computer age: ?I'm interested in computers. I spend a lot of time around them, whether gaming, working, programming or Netting. Surprise, but other people enjoy the same things.<br>?You "see' the same people often, sometimes every day, exchange formalities, discuss problems and events, and generally hang out.?<br>That left very little you could do in Real Life that you couldn't do on the Net. The writer singled out the obvious ones - hugs, kisses and sex.<br>That long answer prompted both agreement and disagreement, naturally. When you're talking essentially about the meaning of life, there is no clear answer.<br>One correspondent admitted being a programmer, but said: ?There's no substitute for Real Life contact with people. I consider the Net little more than a placebo or a poor substitute.<br>?There is a very distinct difference between knowing someone in Real Life and knowing them on the Net. There's a whole dimension to people you miss out on the Net: body language, tone of voice, etc, etc, etc.?As a result, people on the Net generally aren't quite who they appear to be, which isn't necessarily a deliberately deceitful thing, it's more a case of you being unable to see through the masks that all people wear.?<br>But the discussion came to a powerful conclusion - for me at least - with these sage words from another newsgrouper: ?Define "a life'. Your life? Someone else's life? All that matters is that you are happy doing something.<br>?If you find fulfilment in doing something - even sitting in front of a keyboard for 20 hours a day - then you have "a life'.<br>?It's about time the "get a life' phrase was put out to pasture. It's uncool and not even true.?<br>Everybody has their own opinion. Without the Net I wonder how many would be able to float their thoughts, listen to responses and, with luck, grow a bit as a person.<br>Happy New Year.<br></font></p>
