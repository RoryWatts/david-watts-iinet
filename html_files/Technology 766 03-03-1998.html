            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Fred Astaire danced on the ceiling in the 1951 musical Royal Wedding, a feat that moved one American reviewer to describe it as ?an impeccably executed bit of movie magic?. Did you know that Web surfers can do the same thing? Well, sort of.<br>What makes it possible is a browser plug-in called IPIX. This enables a Windows 95, NT or Mac PowerPC user to view a photo on screen and to move around it simply by holding down the left mouse button.<br>You may not be surprised to learn that the specially created images viewed by IPIX are called ? IPIX. They are interactive, spherical images, offering users a complete field of view, from earth to sky, floor to ceiling, horizon to horizon.<br>For example, you can look at a picture of a room at a hotel where you might like to stay. By holding down the mouse and moving it around the photo you can see the whole room, not just a flat two-dimensional area of the room. You can even zoom up to the ceiling - Astaire-like - then swoop around before taking a floor view. You can enlarge or shrink the image as you go too.<br>It is almost as if you can see round corners. But, of course, you cannot. However, you do get a feeling of space and dimension that is impossible to achieve in an ordinary photo.<br>IPIXes are created from two opposing photographs taken with a fisheye lens. Interactive Pictures Australia in Melbourne, which sells IPIX technology here and in New Zealand, can remap images taken this way, joining them into what it calls an an immersive whole.<br>IPIX can then be linked together, to traditional photographs and renderings, or enhanced with audio or other types of files. The company's Web site has an impressive gallery of IPIX examples, including images from the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, which can take the surfer on a virtual walk down the city's main street.Examples of IPIX's business potential abound. For instance, the Toyota motor company uses the immersive image to give prospective buyers tours of two of their newest models.The images look as if they are taken from the driver's seat but a quick mouse tour will show you the passenger seats - front and back - the floor and the ceiling.<br>Another example is of a bed and breakfast apartment in England, which gives a good sticky-beak all round the room, from en-suite to bed. Several newspapers, including the New York Times, use IPIX to provide the big picture, so to speak, of major events such as the NFL football play-offs.<br>A recent IPIX at the site featured the Bizircus troupe performing at the Fremantle Markets. It was possible to track around the stalls and glimpse not just the spectators but busy shoppers behind the action as well.<br></font></p>
