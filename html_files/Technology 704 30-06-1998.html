            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT'S ALL too much. The pace of the new technological world has finally caught up.<br>Last week I subscribed to Foxtel, thus adding pay-TV on one set to normal TV on two others, Nintendo64 on one of them, the Internet on the PC and goodness knows how many CD players, digital alarm clock-radios, microwaves and VCRs ... all with different time settings and personalities.<br>Foxtel tipped the scale from organised chaos to the anarchy of information overload.<br>Take last Thursday for example ... please.<br>I connected to the Net, read 27 e-mails (three abusive, two trying to sell me something), read the Age, the Guardian, the Times, checked Reuters, the ABC, BBC and CNN; then, because of Foxtel, searched the channels until I found when Bonanza was on and asked the network to send me an e-mail reminder.<br>A quick check of my Microsoft Outlook calendar revealed I had missed an important meeting. But not to worry I faxed, then e-mailed the possibly disappointed other party.<br>I then cruised the Foxtel channels on TV, all 28 of them, and spent an average of one minute on each. This figure was distorted because I watched Dr Who for 10 minutes, trying to work out whether Sylvester McCoy was a better time lord than Tom Baker, William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton or even John Pertwee.<br>Case unresolved, I cruised to watch some live Wimbledon, then realised that Fox Sports was showing only one match and I had no idea how anyone but Carlos Moya was doing.<br>Back to the Net and the Wimbledon site for constantly updated scores. A few more e-mails, read the Washington Post and an article by Bill Gates in the Economist, basically saying, I think, no one has the right to interfere with Microsoft's plans for world domination.<br>The exact recollection was erased when I tapped into the Windows 98 newsgroup and found that someone had sent a list of 25 Web links at which one could find news of Win 98's release that day.<br>To shrug off this growing technology I rugged up with a familiar, old book, Flying Visits by Clive James. This is a collection of his postcards from around the world written in the 70s and 80s for the Observer newspaper.<br>Jolly good too, particularly where he describes flying to LA and watching an in-flight movie of Maggie Smith flying to LA for the Oscars in which she is watching an in-flight movie about an actress flying to LA for the Oscars.<br>Not surprised that that gave James a dose of technology, I put down the book and hopped on the Net to see what impact the urbane and literate Australian ex-pat had made on this new medium.<br>Searches at four different engines revealed hardly any at all. Just a TV guide talking about an interview he had with Mel Gibson and an amazingly illiterate review by a fan of his book Falling Towards England.<br>Really, these are some of the reviewer's descriptions of James: ?(he uses) rather elaborate, multisyllabled prose?, ?Australian expatriot?, ?Clive James, the larikan latestarter?.<br>What the Net has given in the ability to communicate, it would appear to have taken in the method of communicating ... good, grammatical English.<br>Confounded by the Net, TV and books, I went outside for air. But it was midnight. The day had gone and I had achieved nothing.<br>Oh, I did get time to write this rubbish ... now for Bonanza.<br>HELP DESK<br>Foxtel:<br>www.foxtel.com.au/<br>Wimbledon:<br>www.wimbledon.org<br>News sites:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/index1.html<br>Bill Gates in the Economist:<br>www.economist.com<br>Windows 98 news:<br>www.sjmercury.com/business/microsoft/<br>Newsgroup:<br>microsoft James review:<br>www.geocities.com/Wellesley/1057/rev20falling.html<br></font></p>
