            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BLOOD AND WINE ??½<br>Director Bob Rafelson describes Blood and Wine as part of a trilogy of dysfunctional family studies which started with Five Easy Pieces and The King of Marvin Gardens. Given he apparently worked on the Blood And Wine project for four years, and given a strong cast, including Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine and Judy Davis, the result is disappointing. Nicholson's character, Alex Gates, is a wine merchant whose business is floundering, as is his marriage to Suzanne (Davis). Gates, in cahoots with emphysemic heavy Victor Spansky (Caine), steals a million dollar diamond. Despite some luminous casting and Rafelson's intention to make a brooding film noir psychological study, this has a B-grade heart. Rated M (Chris McLeod)<br>EXTREME MEASURES ???½<br>Hugh Grant puts away his usual soppy comic character to portray a brilliant young doctor deeply involved in a serious medical and ethical dilemma. A homeless patient dies mysteriously in front of him and then the body goes missing. Grant delves in, and what he finds is murk and controversy as well as a God-like Gene Hackman experimenting on people who cannot defend themselves. This torture and murder is in the name of science; a bid to cure paralysis. It is a dramatic, gritty film with a theme to think about, topped off with excellent New York backdrops. Rated M (David Watts)<br>MY FELLOW AMERICANS ??½<br>This Hollywood vehicle for ageing luminaries James Garner and Jack Lemmon might be alternatively titled Grumpy Old Presidents. It follows the fortunes of two retired presidents from opposite sides of the political fence who were bitter rivals during their time in office. When a corruption scandal from the past looms over them, the two ex-presidents are thrown together to minimise the political damage. Lemmon and Garner bring their vast experience to their roles as a presidential odd couple, turning in engaging if not particularly deep performances. Lemmon is his usual nervy, fussy and mannered self, while Garner's mellow smoothness allows him to glide through the script with glib assurance. My Fellow Americans gently satirises the presidential process in the US without offering any especially novel insights, and is mildly diverting in its treatment of two men suffering post-political career malaise. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>RETURN OF THE JEDI<br>In the final chapter of George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, Luke Skywalker finally confronts the dark side head on in a battle to the death with evil lord Darth Vader. The whole gang are back and there are new friends in the cuddly Ewoks and old villains in the form of the fatter and most vile The Jabba the Hutt. Enhancements to this ?special edition? of Jedi include a more savage Sarlacc in the pit of Carkoon, new live-action aliens partying at Jabba's palace and new victory scenes shot at Mos Eisley space port and the Imperial capital Coruscant. The remastered editions of Star Wars and Empire have done big business at the box office recently and it won't be long before we see the trilogy as a movie marathon. Rated PG (Not Previewed)<br>VEGAS VACATION<br>Fourteen years on from the original National Lampoon's Vacation, the Griswolds are back and heading for some high rolling holiday hi jinx in Las Vegas. Clark (Chevy Chase), Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) Rusty and Audrey are put to the test when the temptations of Vegas are laid before them and, predictably, Clark becomes hooked on gambling. Ellen, on the other hand, has to contend with amorous advances from her idol Wayne Newton. Randy Quaid is back as trailer park cousin Eddie and there's yet another cameo from the flirty supermodel in the red convertible, this time with a twist. Rated PG (Not Previewed)<br>RECENT RELEASES<br>ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN 2 ??<br>Although Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton, Ernest Borgnine and Dom Deluise provide lively voices to this sequel, in which Charlie and Itchy are sent back from heaven to retrieve Gabriel's horn, the action is flat and the story convoluted. The songs are nice but lack the power to hold the interest of the youngest children. Rated G (Tony Barrass)<br>BEVERLY HILLS NINJA ??<br>The jokes come thick and fast in this comedy about a bumbling idiot (Chris Farley) who's taken to be ?the great white ninja? as spoken of in ancient scrolls. However, they're all basically all weight-related, which becomes tiresome once the action moves from Japan to Beverly Hills. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>THE CASTLE ???<br>The Frontline team make a smooth transition from small to big screen, using their subtle, naturalistic style to tell the tale of an Oz family so low on the evolutionary scale they make the Simpsons look like the Kennedys. Not nearly as richly layered as the average episode of Frontline - the story is so straightforward it's rather dull - but the dialogue and performances are funny. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK ????<br>After helping fight a major land battle between Imperial troops and the Rebels on the inhospitable ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker heads in search of the Jedi master Yoda. Before completing his training, Luke is drawn to Cloud City, where trouble is brewing and Darth Vader awaits. More than just a bridging movie between Star Wars and Return of The Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back has some of the best fight sequences and settings of the trilogy. It also has the most satisfying storyline, where we finally learn some hard truths about Vader and the dark side. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU ???½<br>Don't look for any Andrew Lloyd Webber numbers in this charming though ever-so-slight musical, just Jazz Age standards sung by the non-singing all-star cast which includes Alan Alda, Goldie Hawn, Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore and Woody Allen himself. Completely free of angst and weightier moral issues, this is Woody at his fluffiest and most romantic - not nearly as much fun as Bullets Over Broadway or Manhattan Murder Mystery but guaranteed to lift the spirits. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE ???½<br>In the fourth instalment of Jackie Chan's popular Police Story series, Hong Kong cop Jackie chases spies and a nuclear warhead from the Ukraine to the Gold Coast, battling Russian and Chinese mobs, even sharks. His stunts range from snow boarding to jumping from an exploding helicopter. And don't leave until the lights come up or you'll miss the now infamous bloopers, with Chan at the receiving end of all manner of stunts gone wrong. You'll never look at the common ladder and broom in the same light again. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>JAMES AND THE GIANT<br>PEACH ????<br>Henry Selick, the brilliant animator behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, uses pre-computer, stop-motion animation to bring Roald Dahl's beloved children's book to vivid life, setting James and his insect buddies on a magical journey to the Big Apple inside a big peach. Selick is helped by some lovely voice work from Richard Dreyfuss, Simon Callow, Jane Leeves, David Thewlis and, best of all, Susan Sarandon as the seductive, beatnik-ish spider. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>MIGHTY DUCKS 3 ???<br>The storyline is ridiculous and predictable - can the freshman Mighty Ducks ice hockey team improve enough in one week to overpower the twice-as-big senior team? - but these underdog yarns get you in every time. You just want to see the Ducks, who are from the wrong side of the tracks and have a new coach (played by Jeffrey Nordling), wipe the floor with those rich, snotty seniors. Rated G (Pam Brown)<br>ONE FINE DAY ???<br>Michelle Pfeiffer is Melanie Parker, a stressed supermum and architect also raising precocious five-year-old son Sammy. George Clooney is Jack Gordon, a leading newspaper columnist and father every other weekend who is suddenly thrust into full-time parenting when his ex dumps his five-year-old Maggie on him. When the pair are thrown together one rainy New York day, everything that can go wrong does but you just know they'll fall for each other if they stop fighting. A feelgood flick in which ER's bad boy Clooney makes up for his dismal appearance in last year's From Dusk Till Dawn. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>THE SAINT ???½<br>Simon Templar, a man with no real history or identity, is a master of disguise and thievery in Australian director Phillip Noyce's big screen update of The Saint. Kilmer's Saint bears practically no resemblance to The Saint of the 30s films or 60s TV series but he's still appealing as he slips in and out of trouble in the new Russia. Elisabeth Shue is sweet and vulnerable as the young scientist Templar double crosses then falls for. There are plenty of explosions, bad guys and ridiculous, death-defying scenes but treat this Saint as a comedy action romance, not an espionage thriller, and you'll get your money's worth. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>TRIGGER HAPPY ??½<br>Even though the Rat Pack barely survived the Kennedy administration, the recklessly amoral spirit of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Joey Bishop and the gang lives on. Now Larry Bishop, son of comic Joey, has gone the whole hog and made the kind of contemporary gangster movie that Frank, Dino and the others would have been proud to star in. It has nightclubs, guys in flashy clothes, sexy ?broads? and cryptically hip lingo. What it also has - and what will annoy many - is a plot so convoluted I doubt whether even the writer knows what's going on. But if you sit back and enjoy the all-star cast (including Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin and Burt Reynolds) and Bishop's delightfully eccentric, philosophy-laden dialogue, you'll find Trigger Happy an oddball amusement. Trigger Happy is screening at the Revue Cinema and Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS ???<br>Despite some Terminator-like scariness and the introduction of modern evils such as environmental degradation - at the hands of the dreaded weasels - Kenneth Grahame's delightfully silly 1908 tale has been updated gently by ex-Python Terry Jones. Adults may feel a little robbed because Python humour has been quelled, though Eric Idle is a wonderful Ratty, right down to his outrageous tail and whiskers that frizz alarmingly when he is shocked.
