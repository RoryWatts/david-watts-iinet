            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Sports lovers who can't get enough of their favourite game on TV will find plenty of almost live action of the big events on the Web.<br>Two of those - Wimbledon and the third cricket Test - usually hot up past most people's bedtime.<br>Be warned then: these constantly updated sites can become addictive and lead to snoring on the day job.<br>Coverage of the tennis at Wimbledon is near saturation. Web surfers can check games in progress. Scores are updated every five minutes and pictures are beamed from courtside.<br>Or they can check all results, the draw, players' biographies or Wimbledon's rich history. The truly committed can send e-mails to their favourite players.<br>The Third Test starts at Old Trafford on Thursday. The ABC is picking up the TV feed for this while Nine concentrates on the tennis.<br>But Aunty is not showing the early sessions. This means the cricket-starved can ?watch? the match on the CricInfo site, where scores are updated every few minutes. A ball-by-ball description is also offered as are scoreboards from nearly every other first-class game in the world.<br>AFL supporters can watch games fluctuate at the Melbourne Age's live footy site. Main games in each round are displayed on a Java scoreboard that updates with every goal and behind ? sometimes there are glitches.<br>Running match commentaries accompany the scores and a feedback forum enables fans to e-mail comments during a game. These comments are then thrown in with the commentary, giving a sense of virtual barracking.<br></font></p>
