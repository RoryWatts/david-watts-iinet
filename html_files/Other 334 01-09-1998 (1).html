            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Monica Lewinsky affair has been fodder for a frenzy of jokes and joke sites on the Internet. But it has also provoked a very public, tragic plea from one Netizen appalled by the episode.<br>Online news sites like MSNBC and CNN have delighted in record-breaking traffic - measured in the millions - to their Web coverage of the case.<br>By comparison, Jim Kenzig of Ohio, estimates maybe a few thousand will see his site.<br>Mr Kenzig has posted a message imploring Mr Clinton to stop the waste of money and time involved in the Lewinsky case.<br>He circulated his planned letter to members of a global e-mail discussion group of which he has been a major contributor.<br>The group consists of about 150 members, mostly parents of children with brain stem gliomas, a rare but nearly always fatal tumour. Some members of the group are adult sufferers.<br>The letter follows one that Mr Kenzig sent to the White House last year after his 10-year-old daughter Kristen died from her tumour. Mr Clinton has never replied to that plea for money to be set aside for research into fatal diseases that affect children.<br>Last week another member of the brain tumour group lost a child to the disease.<br>Mr Kenzig's Internet plea says in part: ?Mr President, when I hear that $US40 million has been spent on this hoopla surrounding your ordeal it pains me and many many other parents a great deal.<br>?Forty million dollars could possibly have just been enough money to find a cure to at least one disease. Maybe the one that killed my daughter and so many other children.<br>?But thanks to Mr Starr's investigation we will never know.<br>?The next time you see Mr Starr I would like you to put this letter in his hands. Make it known to him that what he is doing is possibly allowing another child to die.<br>?Please find a way to put a stop to this madness. Please put the money into research and funding to find a cure for brain tumours and cancer.<br>?People with brain tumours don't give a damn what you did in your private life. They don't even care if you lied to them. They do care when they have to watch helplessly as their sons and daughters and husbands and wives suffer and die from an incurable disease.?<br>Mr Kenzig's plea is a public one, but it can be safely assumed thousands of American Net users have e-mailed the President about the Lewinsky case.<br>The White House has run a very open Web site for some time. Vice-President Al Gore is a champion of new technology's ability to enhance democracy.<br>It is possible to e-mail Mr Clinton and Mr Gore directly from the White House site. Their wives also have e-mail addresses.<br>The US style of online democracy differs little from many big corporations in that users have to fill in a form before sending their messages into cyberspace.<br>E-mails to the Executive (the Clintons and the Gores) require a user to give name, e-mail address, street address, any political affiliation, asks the purpose of the message (there are nine choices) and the topic before allowing the writer to type in up to 10,000 characters.<br>Once sent, the e-mail is acknowledged electronically, but replies are done only by traditional mail ?if (deemed) appropriate?.<br>The Lewinsky case is not off the agenda at the site either. It is possible to type the words ?Monica Lewinsky? at a search panel of the document archives page and receive about 40 links to speeches and press releases, including the President's famous speech.<br>?The author has an interest in the subject. He suffers from a brain stem glioma and is a member of Mr Kenzig's discussion group.<br>HELP DESK<br>Jim Kenzig's letters:<br>www.zoner.net/zoned/pres.html<br>www.zoner.net/zoned/pres1.html<br>White House:<br>www.whitehouse.gov<br>White House documents:<br>www.pub.whitehouse.gov/retrieve-documents.html<br></font></p>
