            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Children can crash a computer as soon as look at it.<br>That is the impression they give with fast fingers trying to keep pace with inquiring minds. ?What's this do?? Click. ?And this, and this, and that?? Click, click, double-click ? crash.<br>It can be both alarming and delightful to watch at the same time. And you must watch, not simply to protect the computer, but also to give grown-up advice and guidance. Bad discipline is too easy to teach yourself.<br>Point them at the Internet and they have a natural affinity with hypertext. One click and they're gone.<br>Which is where the real worry begins for some people. And it is not fear of crashes this time; it is the fear of the great unknown, that seeming cesspit of cyberspace.<br>The latest battle on the Net is being fought by the Government in the name of children, to some extent, with experienced Netizens in the opposite corner waving the flag of free speech.<br>Last month, Attorney-General Daryl Williams and Communications Minister Richard Alston released a set of proposals for a national approach to Net censorship.<br>The press release accompanying them is couched in friendly newspeak like this:<br>?As a guideline, what is protected behaviour offline should be protected behaviour online. This framework balances the need to address community concerns in relation to content with the need to ensure that regulation does not inhibit industry growth and potential.?<br>The Government wants to guard morals on the Net using the same principles it applies to TV, books, videos and computer games.<br>Thus, it wants penalties for Internet Service Providers who allow people to publish content that would be classified as objectionable in other media.<br>The intent may be considered worthy by those who believe governments have a right to regulate what people see and do, particularly in the privacy of their own homes.<br>But, as always, censorship opens cans of worms.<br>What appears lost on governments is the global nature of the Net. Under the present regulatory proposals, an ISP could be in trouble for allowing Joe Bloggs of Sydney to put pornography on his Web page and publish it through that ISP's normal channels. But if Joe Bloggs of Sydney creates the same Web page and publishes it using the Web services of the American provider Geocities, say, what power would our Government have?<br>Can it levy penalties on an American ISP? Can it ask the Americans to refrain from allowing that page to be transmitted? Very unlikely and practically impossible are the answers.<br>It gets messier when you consider Usenet newsgroups, the bulletin boards of the Net. Can ISPs honestly be held responsible for the content of thousands of messages a day pouring into each of more than 18,000 groups and occupying gigabytes of storage?<br>User groups such as Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) and the WA Internet Association (WAIA) are unhappy with the latest bid to regulate the Net. The EFA has an electronic petition which can be signed securely on the Web.<br>The petition asks the Government to refrain from more Net regulation and makes these points:The Internet is a complex, global environment where traditional concepts of regulation are not easily applied or enforced.The full potential for development of the Internet in Australia will depend on governments recognising rights to freedom of speech taken for granted by other societies. The arguments have been well raked over for at least the past two years. The more Netizens stress the practical impossibilities of policing a lightning-fast, interactive, global medium, the more governments try to intervene.<br>The latest Australian bid comes just weeks after the US Supreme Court struck down the Communications Decency Act with these words: ?The interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical but unproven benefit of censorship.?<br>With all that in mind, it is still worth remembering that there is some appalling rubbish on the Net, though it is neither as easy to find nor simple to access as some hysterical reports suggest.<br>If you do not want children exposed to it, ensure they are regulated - not by governments - but by real, caring adults.<br>HELP DESK<br>Hypertext: Text with key phrases underlined which link to other Web pages on related subjects.<br>Government proposals: www.dca.gov.au/policy/<br>fwork_4_online_svces/<br>framework.htm<br>Government press release:<br>www.dca.gov.au/mediarel/<br>c8197.html<br>EFA campaign:www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/<br>contreg.html<br>WA Internet Association: www.waia.asn.au<br>Net censorship dilemma latest: www.thehub.com.au/rene/<br>liberty/future.html#Alert<br>Digital Doomsday Clock: www.CataLaw.com/doom/<br></font></p>
