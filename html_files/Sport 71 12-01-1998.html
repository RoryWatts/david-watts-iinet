            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT lovers are being deluged by sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.<br>The Hopman Cup may have finished on Saturday with the Slovak Republic's surprise win, but at least you can say you have seen Pat Rafter's chest bared on the ABC, much to the bewildered amusement of Fred Stolle.<br>And this week promises to be a veritable skinfest as Channel 7 brings swimming from Challenge Stadium in the eighth world swimming championships.<br>Up to now you could be forgiven for thinking it is the world drug-taking championships, with the storm of sensational news about China and the human growth hormones.<br>As for rock 'n' roll...well this is undoubtedly drawing a long bow, but Lleyton Hewitt, the 16-year-old sensation of the Australian hardcourt championships, shown yesterday on SBS, looks a little like Zac Hanson, pop music idol to teeny-boppers the world over.<br>Few sports have the sex appeal of either tennis or swimming. It is doubtful you have heard of anyone lusting after South African spinner Pat Symcox, for example.<br>But Rafter is a far different story.<br>He increases the blood pressure of teenage girls - and not a few of their mothers - with his very 90s scruffy good looks and athleticism.<br>His shirt-changing courtside at Burswood last week drew screams reminiscent of a Hansons concert.<br>And they inevitably signalled an alarming drop in Rafter's form, so that he had to battle out three three-setters.<br>So, not only did he pump up the girls' blood pressure, he nearly caused heart attacks among the male audience as well.<br>He is very good for tennis, though.<br>Pete Sampras may be as nearly a perfect player as there has been, but Rafter is human.<br>He plays well a lot of the time and is a fast and furious chaser, as well as good server and volleyer.<br>But then he gets a worried look and appears to be drowning in sweat. His game goes off and he has to summon up lots of courage and concentration just to get back in the contest.<br>All the while, viewers contort themselves in agony with him, praying for him and cursing him for putting them through the agonies of missed chances.<br>Then he wins. And he is so boyish and charming about it. Yes, he's good for the game if not the weak of heart.<br>So is Hewitt. He is ridiculously young and talented. And hungry.<br>Rafter might tug at the heartstrings, but it is easy to imagine any number of women just wanting to hold and cuddle young Hewitt.<br>He wears his cap back to front over a bundle of blond curls, bounces around like Boris Becker and hits the ball as hard as a 25-year-old.<br>Yesterday, he won $70,000, what many professional people struggle to make in a year.<br>He then made a very mature speech for a 16-year-old while all the time you could tell he was just aching to hold the trophy over his head like all his heroes.<br>If he can keep it up, he'll be good for tennis, too.<br></font></p>
