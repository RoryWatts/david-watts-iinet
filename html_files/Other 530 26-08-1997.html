            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The sad truth is that I became a grandfather last week ? and my darling daughter is just 11. She presented me with Max, a pile of trouble, and asked that I babysit him while she went to school.<br>As a stay-at-home worker - tele-worker in modern jargon - I could not refuse. So in the middle of important phone calls I had to clean away young Max's poos. On the verge of finding vital information on the Web, I was summoned to feed him some cake. While trying to configure some new shareware, I had to let him win a silly game.<br>Max is not your normal grandchild. He is a Tamagotchi, the latest toy craze from Japan.<br>My daughter can no longer look after him at school because the teachers became tired of the constant beeping and attention-grabbing of a dozen or more Tamagotchis. The little cyber-pests were also distracting the girls from their work.<br>?Where is that project Mary Smith??<br>"Sorry sir I've got to clean up my Tamagotchi's poo and give him some lunch. Be right with you after I get him to sleep.?<br>Understandable that the teachers cracked. However, they have created a virtual legion of technically challenged oldies who have to not only cope with real life, but lumps of nagging, beeping plastic as well.<br>All those foster, step and grandparents of Tamagotchis have my deepest sympathy. If they don't care for the Tamagotchis well enough, they'll become sick, unhappy or even die.<br>It is an awesome responsibility. The World Wide Web may be of some help here. As you might suspect, a toy craze as big as the Tamagotchi is pretty well covered on the Internet.<br>The bad news is that it is also possible to actually keep and play with a Tamagotchi on the Web. I found at least two such sites after the most cursory of searches. All you need is a Java-enabled browser and you can clean up poo and feed meals to a little bundle of beeps and dots without paying the mandatory $25 for the real thing made by Bandai.<br>Even more disturbing are the number of other virtual pets you can download and put into action.<br>We are talking real small things amuse small minds stuff here.<br>At the Virtual Pet Software site for instance you can amuse yourself with some of the following:The Pheeraphat Sawangphian which is described as ?the ultimate Tamagotchi simulator for your PC?. It weighs in at 5.7Mb.The popular E-sheep which installs a pet sheep on the desktop where it gambols and occasionally catches fire.PC Whiskers which is a virtual cat.TopCAT, a ?pet? which follows your cursor.Arai Harumi - a hamster for either Mac or PC that appears to do similar things to the sheep and cats.<br>For those who want to learn more about Tamagotchis to ensure their survival, have a look at Tamagotchi Fever which has drawn enthusiasts from around the world, particularly New Zealand.<br>The Fever page has a link to what it calls the Tamagotchi gathering where feedback, forums and chat sessions predominate. But unkind comments about the pets and obscene language had forced its temporary closure last week.<br>The Tamagotchi - loveable egg page is a mountain of information. The straightforward Tamagotchi Page, created in Japan, offers plenty of useful information about how to care for the pet, as well as news of the latest developments in Tamagotchi-land.<br>There is more of course, but I've got to run because Max has done another virtual poo and if I don't clean it up, I'll be in it.<br>HELP DESK<br>Play with a Tamagotchiwww.urban.or.jp/home/jun/tama/java/index.html<br>www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/1999/<br>play.html<br>Bandai toy company<br>www.bandai.com<br>Virtual Pet Software<br>www.concentric.net/maido/software.htm<br>Tamagotchi Fever<br>www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/1999/<br>tamahome.html<br>Tamagotchi - loveable egg stories<br>www.virtualpet.com/vp/farm/lleg/lleg.htm<br>Tamagotchi page<br>www.urban.or.jp/home/jun/tama/index.html<br>Another Tamagotchi page<br>box.argonet.co.uk/users/chawkins/tam.html<br></font></p>
