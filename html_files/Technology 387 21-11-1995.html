            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A VIRTUAL smorgasbord fit for a cannibal awaits World Wide Web surfers.<br>Tantalisingly thin slices of the human body - fit to make Hannibal Lechter's mouth water - comprise the Visible Human Project.<br>Begun in 1986 as an effort to advance medical and scientific knowledge of human anatomy, the project only recently came to the Web.<br>Its originators are probably surprised that something intended as an educational tool for doctors is listed in at least four ?cool site? links.<br>It must be the voyeur in people, or a fascination with what makes us tick.<br>The project was begun by the US National Library of Medicine which says it saw an era where its bibliographic and factual database services would be complemented by libraries of digital images, distributed over high speed computer networks and by high capacity physical media.<br>In 1991, the University of Colorado at Denver won a contract to provide images of 1mm slices of nearly all the human body and assemble them on a database.<br>Researchers had a male and female cadaver, which were scanned by computer tomography (CaT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br>The MRI images are 256 pixel by 256 pixel resolution. The CT data consists of axial scans of the entire body taken at 1mm intervals at a resolution of 512 pixels by 512 pixels .<br>There are 1871 cross-sections for each mode, CT and anatomy. The complete male data set is 15 gigabytes in size.<br>It is not a downloading job to envy. But the Web site, with its small samples from the head, pelvis and foot, provides easily accessible .gif images.<br>URL: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/extramural_<br>research.dir/visible_human.ht ???<br>VOYEURISM of a completely different kind is on display at the Peeping Tom Page.<br>But if it's true to say ?don't judge a book by its cover?, it's equally true to say ?don't judge a Web page by its title?.<br>Peeping Tom is a look at life in the raw for sure, but don't expect Elle Macpherson or Cindy Crawford to strut their stuff.<br>Rated in Pointcom's top 5 per cent of sites, Peeping Tom provides real-time images, either by video or still camera.<br>You can choose to view the image presented by a video camera in a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for example. Download it and you will see that street as it is ... not now ... but only minutes before you downloaded.<br>There are images of Niagara Falls, Sydney at night, various laboratories round the world, street corners galore and an aquarium at Netscape.<br>But why do it? Surely this is pretty banal.<br>The fascination, as with crystal radio in its formative years, is that you can do it at all.<br>URL:http://www.it.com.au/rover/<br></font></p>
