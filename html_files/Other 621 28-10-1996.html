            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I LIKED a lot about WA when I first came here 15 years ago: the beaches, the weather, the clean air, the openness and the dry humour. But the thing that really appealed was the quiz night. Quiz nights then seemed to be a peculiarly WA tradition. I had never experienced one during my time in Queensland, NSW or Victoria. Eastern Staters know their trivia, of course, but no one had provided a forum to show off this knowledge until I set foot in Perth.<br>Like a lot of people - but mostly blokes - trivia is second nature to me. I can still name the 1964 and 1968 Australian touring cricket sides to England without drawing breath, and the winners of every Melbourne Cup from 1960 (MacDougall) to 1978 (Arwon).<br>However, like most trivia buffs, I have trouble with the exact figures for tax returns, wedding anniversaries and other less important things.<br>Good friend Ray Jordan, who writes the weekly wine column for The West Australian, is of similar disposition. Around the dinner table while our wives blather on about children's education, health and the comings and goings of suburbia, we are likely to debate the really serious and important issues like: would Bill Lawry or Allan Border be a better captain of a theoretical Test team made up entirely of left-handers?<br>Jordan, like me, can rattle off Cup winners from 1960 to the late 70s. After that both our minds go into a serious haze which we think is a result of life catching up with many other bits of information in our late 20s ... like PIN numbers, courting, work and raising families. That or the alcohol.<br>Recently I happened on an invaluable repository of trivia known as the Deb and Jennifer Totally Useless page. Like a lot of truly useful stuff, it is on the Internet.<br>On this page I even found what might be a proper definition of the word trivia ... ?if you care about it, it's not trivia?.<br>And some possible meanings of the word, too: ?The derivation of trivia comes from the Latin "tri' and "via', which means three streets. This is because in ancient times, at an intersection of three streets in Rome (or some other Italian place), they would have a type of kiosk where ancillary information was listed. You might be interested in it, you might not, hence they were bits of "trivia',? says the Totally Useless page.<br>Or ... ?Trivia is the Roman goddess of sorcery, hounds and the crossroads?.<br>Whatever definition applies, there is no getting over the fact that trivia can glug up otherwise normally healthy brains. True trivia buffs would laugh if you told them something as uninteresting as the fact that Mick Dolenz, the drummer for the Monkees, played Circus Boy on early Australian TV. Or that Colin Petersen, drummer with the Bee Gees, played Smiley in the Australian movies of the late 1950s.<br>But, thanks to the Totally Useless Page, one is able to divine that the mother of another Monkee, Mike Nesmith, invented White-Out, the correcting fluid old fashioned typists cannot do without.<br>Also, Jamie Farr, who played the cross-dressing Klinger in the TV series M*A*S*H, was the only member of the cast to have fought in the Korean War that the series depicts.<br>Here is just a smidgeon of the trivia found at Totally Useless:<br>? Camel's milk does not curdle.<br>? A person from Nauru is called a Nauruan; this is the only palindromic nationality.<br>? The longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary is ?floccinaucinihilipilification,? which means ?the act of estimating as worthless.?<br>? The word ?queueing? is the only English word with five consecutive vowels.<br>? In every episode of Seinfeld there is a Superman somewhere.<br>? Mice, whales, elephants, giraffes and humans all have seven neck vertebra.<br>NB: Like a good trivia buff I have forgotten the important piece of information ... the Web address of the Totally Useless Page.<br></font></p>
