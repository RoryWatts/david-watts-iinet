            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Four years ago, many people saw only text on the Web. They were using the non-graphical browser Lynx, a Unix program developed in 1989 and adapted to read HTML during 1992.<br>Lynx, shown left beside Netscape 4.0, is still around today. Many people can access it through Telnet. It does not show images, fonts, background, frames or much else and you have to type all URLs in longhand. But it can be fast.<br>The first widely available browsers to allow images came in 1993. One was Cello, which has not changed since and was described as old-fashioned as far back as January 1995.<br>The other was NCSA Mosaic, developed by a team including Marc Andreesen at the University of Illinois. Andreesen left NCSA in 1994 and developed his own browser, Netscape Navigator, and put it free on the Web.<br>Microsoft turned its attention to the Web properly in 1995 with its first Internet Explorer in mid-95 but the users were not impressed. MSIE 2.0 came out in early 1996 but software reviewers rated Netscape 2.0 a far better bet in April 1996.<br>Netscape and MS finally went head to head in August 1996 with version 3 of their browsers. Reviewers gave MS a slight edge, and Netscape's once mighty 84 per cent share of the market dropped to about 65.<br>The latest onslaught came last month when Netscape released its Communicator suite. MS is still developing MSIE 4.0.<br></font></p>
