            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SUPERMODEL Elle Macpherson is the new $1 million face of WA. The Government's decision to appoint her as a sort of ambassador at large is designed to attract saturation coverage of the State.<br>Elle is good at that. She is everywhere on the World Wide Web. The Alta Vista search engine lists 10,000 matches with the words ?Elle Macpherson?.<br>Many sites uncovered on a pretty easy search for Elle are purely pictorial showing the famous figure of ?The Body? in every conceivable pose.<br>Precious few tell you much about the woman, who after all is more than just a clothes rack. She is not a bad actor and also a reasonably astute businesswoman.<br>One of the few with some biographical information is Elle Macpherson: The Wonder from Down Under. It also provides links to many other Elle worship pages, though neglects to mention a page called I Won't Let Elle Macpherson Have My Baby.<br>This one is listed by Alta Vista with the precis: ?I know what you're saying: "Why not? She's beautiful, of child-bearing age, and she's probably crazy about you'.?<br>Unfortunately WestWeb's attempts to access the accompanying URL (http://www.csun.edu/~lg42537/elle. html) proved futile because the remote server was down.<br>???<br>ELLE is fast becoming an icon of the 90s, but the future will tell whether she becomes as big an icon as Brigitte Bardot was in the 50s and 60s.<br>The steamy French actress gave the game away in the mid-1970s and has been a dedicated campaigner for animal rights ever since.<br>She now has her own Web page, promoting her foundation for saving animals. Don't expect any supermodel-type pictures of BB though. This site is serious.<br>???<br>EVEN more serious is the Virtual Jerusalem Prayer page which allows surfers to write a short prayer and submit it.<br>The prayer will be printed out and lodged in a crack in the Western Wall, an old tradition in Jerusalem.<br>???<br>NOT serious at all is the Mother of All Humour Archives at Cornell University in the US.<br>Here is the repository for many of the funny stories and lists that abound in group mailing lists on the Net. There are hundreds of funny stories and jokes of all types, from shaggy dog to blue.<br>URLs:<br>Elle Macpherson: The Wonder From Down Under<br>http://www.cris.com/~forceten/elle.htm<br>Realms of Magic: Elle<br>http://204.140.242.11/femmes/ELLE/index.shtml<br>Brigitte Bardot Foundation<br>http://www.fondationbrigittebardot.fr/uk/index.html<br>Virtual Jerusalem Prayer<br>http://virtual.co.il/city-services/prayer/<br>http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/ckline/humor/maillist.html Mother of all Humor Archives<br></font></p>
