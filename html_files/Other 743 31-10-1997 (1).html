            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WAS just as well world stockmarkets plummeted, revived and generally gave suit-wearers ulcers this week. And it was a good thing too that a white pointer shark tried - and thankfully failed - to breakfast on human sushi off Cottesloe.<br>Without those headline-inducing events we might have all been swallowed up in a sea of sex and nudity. That would not be such a bad thing normally. But much of the sex and nudity around this week has been a trifle disturbing ? or I might just be getting old and cranky.<br>It all began with The Simpsons, you know, the cartoon family of dysfunctional Americans on TV. Often they are very funny for mums and dads as well as the kiddies.<br>Anyway Homer had ordered a blowie at a Japanese restaurant, having demolished every other delicacy on the menu.<br>The master chef was the only one able to cut up the blowie properly, ensuring the diner did not eat fatally poisonous flesh.<br>However, the master chef was otherwise occupied in the carpark.It became obvious, even to young eyes, what he was up to. The picture showed the chef's upper torso and feminine arms and legs wrapped around through the window of a car.<br>Bit rich for a kiddies' show. Oh yes, Homer ate the blowie, thought he was going to die, tried to make the most of his last day on Earth, but then found he had been wrongly diagnosed.<br>Not long after that, at the time Channel 7 normally shows Full Frontal, the Australian comedy that sends up other TV shows, I was sitting peacefully wondering why my children, who normally laugh uproariously at the Pauline Hanson jokes, were so quiet.<br>I looked at the screen and it wasn't Full Frontal, although what was on there was certainly full frontal exposure.<br>Seven showed something called Nude Moments II. It featured, among other things, a totally nude episode of Blind Date from Sweden, Topless Darts from Britain (the land that has deemed Roy and HG's Club Buggery a bit over the top and renamed it Roy and HG at the Bughouse) and a game called Sexy Soccer in which very tall women wearing nothing but coloured stockings and very small G-strings play indoor soccer.<br>WO days later, Durex, makers of the condoms not the sticky tape, presented their global sex survey to the world.<br>There were some interesting results from the 10,000 16-to-45-year-olds in 14 countries who spoke on behalf of the world's population of six billion in 10 times the number of countries.<br>For example: Condom users spend 18.9 minutes making love while those not using a condom get the whole thing over and done with in 17.2 minutes - Italians take 13 minutes and Americans claim they spend half an hour.<br>The Sydney Morning Herald's Stay in Touch column wondered whether these figures had anything to do with (a) this survey was done by a condom manufacturer (b) an awful lot of time is spent trying to get the damned thing on or (c) both.<br>Another fascinating thing about the survey was that its findings were presented by one Tottie Goldsmith, host of Channel 10's Sex/Life.Now try to imagine a less sexy name than Tottie. You might come up with Gladys or Daisy, but Tottie's right up there.<br>Just for a laugh, and to get sex and nudity off my mind, I went to the movies ? and saw The Full Monty.<br>Now this is a hilarious British film which I can highly recommend. It just happens to be about nudity as six desperate unemployed Yorkshiremen decide to become male strippers to earn a quid.<br>Oh well, then it was off to the school sports, and I'm glad to report there was absolutely no sex or nudity, just thrilling games of tunnelball and corner spry.<br>Mind you the GYMs (gorgeous young mums) get younger and more gorgeous by the year.<br>I think I'll have my blood pressure tablets now, nurse.<br></font></p>
