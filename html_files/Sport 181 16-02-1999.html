            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WEST Coast's Paul Symmons claims at his club's Internet site that the favourite saying of coach Mick Malthouse is: ?Go to your locker, unzip your skull and put your brain in.?<br>Malthouse's advice was needed in more sports than football this week.<br>Jack Newton was gob-smacked by Greg Norman's agonising near-miss of a putt at the 14th in the Masters, shown so grippingly by Seven on Sunday.<br>After Norman's ball ringed the cup and popped out, Newton exclaimed: ?That went 180 degrees.?<br>Sandy Roberts bellowed: ?You mean 360, Jack.?<br>To which a chortling Newton replied: ?I'll pay that. Never was any good at maths.?<br>Our golf writer Len Findlay reported it went right around the hole, then did another quarter-lap - that's 450 degrees.<br>The ABC, having just shown the NSL match between Northern Spirit (which has graced our screens at least three times this season) and Carlton, shoved Perth Glory's thumping 6-0 defeat of Brisbane to third spot in the sports news. Trevor Jenkins then introduced the Glory report and accompanying precious footage of the goal rampage by gushing: ?This is the story of the day.?<br>England batsman Nasser Hussain would have wished that umpire Daryl Harper had followed the Malthouse advice during the lopsided one-day cricket final in Melbourne.<br>Channel 9 viewers clearly saw Hussain hit his pad and nothing else to Glenn McGrath's first ball.<br>But seconds later Hussain was on his way with the cartoon duck for company on screen.<br>According to London's Observer newspaper: ?Hussain fell first ball to a catch at the wicket, which owed everything to Shane Warne's brazen appeal from first slip and umpire Harper's feverish imagination.?<br>Then of course there was the Ansett Cup. You could tell football was definitely back on Saturday when Collingwood coach Tony Shaw said at half-time, when his experimental side led Sydney: ?Yeah, they've got good leg speed. We done a lot of work on that.?<br>The Pies might have to do a bit more. Sydney mowed them down.<br>Excitement built before the first cup game between Fremantle and Hawthorn on Thursday. Adrian Barich on Seven news could hardly contain himself when he reported that Docker Michael Clark had had ?two shoulder-knee reconstructions, ah, knee reconstructions?.<br>Then Basil Zempilas chipped in: ?Not a bad crowd, but there's no one at the city end.? Barich responded gleefully: ?That's because there's no stand there, Bas.?<br>The Dockers are showing a clever commercial aimed at attracting new members. After Thursday's humiliation against the Hawks, the ad looks somewhat suspect.<br>It pictures Docker players actually catching the ball with one grab.<br>They can only improve ... provided they follow the Malthouse advice.<br></font></p>
