            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE search is on for better ways to track down information on the World Wide Web.<br>The catalyst is a report last week by two US researchers who found that search engines have failed to keep pace with the ever-expanding Web.<br>Several online publications have responded with advice on how to improve searching.<br>Steve Lawrence and Lee Giles found that no engine of 11 major ones tested was logging more than about 16 per cent of the Web.<br>In fact, all 11 engines combined covered only 335 million Web pages, or 42 per cent of the estimated total number of 800 million pages.<br>This was ?substantially? worse than the pair found in a similar survey in 1997 when they estimated the Web contained 320 million pages.<br>They also accused the engines of a bias towards US sites and sites that have more links to them. The engines were also more likely to index commercial sites than educational ones, their report says.<br>Dr Lawrence and Dr Giles, of NEC Research in Princeton, New Jersey, have published their research in the latest edition of the science journal Nature. Net users can obtain a copy in Adobe Acrobat format by e-mailing Dr Lawrence through a link set up at www.wwwmetrics.com. Their 1997 report is available in HTML on the Web (see Help Desk).<br>The latest report estimates the Web's 800 million pages contain about 15 terabytes of data (about 6 terabytes of textual content, after removing HTML tags, comments and extra white space). It also contains about 180 million images (three terabytes).<br>About 83 per cent of sites contain commercial content and 6 per cent contain scientific/educational content. Only 1.5 per cent contain pornographic content.<br>The 11 search engines tested were fed with an automated program that contained 1050 queries, including terms such as ?smart matter? and ?rocchio algorithm?.<br>The doctors admitted many terms used in the queries were not representative of common use because they were culled from a list used by fellow scientists at NEC Research. ?But the important issue here is that the search engines seem to be biased towards more well-known information,? Dr Lawrence said.<br>Despite this academic mode of inquiry, Dr Lawrence's recommendations about improving Web searches are almost identical to those put forward by several online computer help sites in response to the report.<br>He told the New York Times that users could sharpen searches by performing a metasearch - combining the results of several search engines.<br>The Times said Dr Lawrence hesitated to suggest specific names, but the paper searched for the word ?metasearch? in the Hotbot engine and found Metacrawler, Metasearch and Dogpile.<br>The ability of metasearch engines to ferret more information was backed up by the study's finding that a combination of 11 engines covered 42 per cent of pages as against 16 per cent for the leading single engine, Northern Light.<br>The Ziff Davis Anchor Desk site, an online journal dedicated to the Web, devoted last Thursday's edition to advice on ways to overcome the search deficiencies found in the NEC report.<br>Under the headline ?Search Engines Stink?, it reinforced the recommendation that people use metasearch engines, naming Mamma and ProFusion along with Dogpile as good tools.<br>Coincidentally, Perth-based technical director David Musgrave e-mailed The West Australian unannounced late last week also to recommend the Mamma metasearcher.<br>Anchor Desk also recommended Net directories as alternative ways of searching, citing LookSmart, About.com, Netscape Netcenter and Suite101 as effective sites. Yahoo is probably the best-known directory on the Web but Anchor Desk said it was concerned with the quality of results rather than quantity.<br>Latest versions of Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers offer alternatives to searching with ?What's Related? buttons which wade through archived sites collected by each company. Version 5 of MSIE comes with an add-on called Alexa that interrogates sites for statistics, ratings and can recommend sites with similar information.<br>Web finders<br>THE NEC report studied 11 search engines and estimated their Web coverage as follows:<br>per cent<br>?Northern Light<br>(www.northern light.com)       16<br>?Snap (www.snap.com)            15.5<br>?AltaVista<br>(www.altavista.com)            15.5<br>?Hotbot (www.hotbot.com)        11.3<br>?Microsoft<br>(search.microsoft.com)         8.5<br>?Infoseek (www.infoseek.com)    8.0<br>?Google (www.google.com)        7.8<br>?Yahoo (www.yahoo.com)          7.4<br>?Excite (www.excite.com)        5.6<br>?Lycos (www.lycos.com)          2.5<br>?Euroseek (www.euroseek.net)    2.2<br>Nearly all these engines are US-based. Some such as Yahoo, AltaVista and Excite have Australian sites. Purely Australian engines such as Web Wombat and Anzwers can be found at www.iinet.net.au/<br>~watto/index1.html#search.<br>Help Desk<br>Get copy of NEC report:<br>www.wwwmetrics.com<br>1997 report:<br>www.neci.nec.com/~lawrence/papers/<br>earch-ieee99/<br>Metasea engines:<br>www.metacrawler.com<br>www.metasearch.com<br>www.dogpile.com<br></font></p>
