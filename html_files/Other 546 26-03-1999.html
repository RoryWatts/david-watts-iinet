            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH people have enough problems. But one dilemma that will not go away is whether to live north or south of the river.<br>I was reminded of this about a week ago at a function where the guest speaker was brave enough to confess he was a Victorian, and a Carlton supporter as well.<br>In his few years here, he said, one of the most commonly asked questions with which he had had to grapple was: ?Would you prefer to live north or south of the river??<br>When I first came to Perth in the late 70s - actually so late in the 70s it was 1981 but after several years in the Sodom and Gomorrah of Melbourne and Sydney, Perth still felt like the 70s - that was one of the questions I was often asked, too.<br>You could be at a party in Dalkeith or Karrinyup or Lesmurdie, it did not seem to matter, and someone would always pop the north-south question. My usual response in those early days was to say: ?You what? Who cares.? Within a few months I realised the lack of invitations was directly linked to failing to come to grips with one of the big issues in this real estate-obsessed city.<br>I wish now I could have answered as wittily as the guest speaker of the other night said his wife did. ?Anywhere in WA is north of the river . . . the Yarra.?<br>I had almost forgotten about the north-south divide because over the years I have made my choice and, by and large, associate mostly with the tribes in my area. They know where I live, so they spare me the question and concentrate on any new settlers.<br>But the north-south divide has always festered at the back of my brain because I think it is a question based on falsehoods.<br>If you look at a map of Perth you might notice the Swan River does not dissect the city north-south in any neat fashion. The great stomach shape that dominates the map tends to run north-east to south-west, or vice-versa. In most cases it divides on an east-west basis.<br>Thus, if you live in the leafy western suburbs, where people consider they are north of the river, you are much farther south than the inhabitants of Belmont, who, we are led to believe, are south of the river.<br>If you live in Como you can be both north and south of the Swan River because of its contortions, but goodness knows how you classify where the people of that suburb live in relation to the Canning River.<br>The north or south of the river question never mentions which river does it? So South Perthites are south of the Swan but north of the Canning.<br>People around the airport are way north of the Canning and the western suburbanites, but fobbed off as south-of-the-river dwellers.<br>Those in the mortgage belt along the north coast are definitely north of the river but probably don't care. A person in Ocean Reef might respond: ?River, what river? You mean there is a river in Perth. How quaint.?<br>If people really care about this stuff - and the question is still asked enough to suggest they do - then they might look for a new classification. Are you a west banker or an east banker, for example. This neglects the upper reaches of the Swan where it is more in east-west mode, so supplementary questions about north banker or south banker might have to be asked.<br>Then all those who really care can be classified as a bunch of bankers.<br>The above tirade probably has a lot to do with the fact the Western Warriors massacred my native Queensland in the Sheffield Shield final. This victory no doubt sparked a headline that never appeared but was almost certainly thought about:<br>Bulls hit.<br></font></p>
