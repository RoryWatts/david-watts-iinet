            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE big Web presences continue to get bigger, according to the latest reports and surveys.<br>Leading the way is America Online (AOL). Its fourth quarter results for the financial year, released last week, showed the company added 755,000 subscribers and that revenue for user subscriptions was up 39 per cent.<br>AOL's revenues were $2.18 billion higher than the market expected, according to the BBC. And this was a big increase on the $1.4 billion earned in the same quarter last year.<br>Revenues from advertising were up by 87 per cent to $465 million, a significant figure given that industry analysts believe that as free ISPs spread around the world, AOL will have to rely more heavily on advertising.<br>AOL continues to be that rare breed of Web company, showing a profit that has risen to $243 million. The company said the average customer spent 52 minutes a day using its site, compared with 44 minutes a year ago.<br>The monthly survey of leading sites run by Media Matrix at its Relevant Knowledge site showed that AOL, on top of its high earnings, continued to attract visitors in big numbers.<br>It was the second most-visited site with nearly 30 million unique visits in June, up 3 per cent on May.<br>The top site was Yahoo with 32.8 million visitors, a rise of 6 per cent. Third was msn.com which had 22.8 million visitors, also 3 per cent more than last month.<br>But the biggest winner in the survey, according to the New York-based research group, was online retailer Amazon.com.<br>The number of people visiting the Amazon.com domain in June rose nearly 12 per cent to 11.2 million, making it the 13th most popular site.<br>That was the biggest traffic gain reported among the top 20 sites.<br>Media Matrix said its figures were compiled from users who, on average, logged on to the Web for 13.5 days in the month. Those users averaged 49 minutes a day online and 11.2 hours a month.<br>People accessing the Net from work log on more frequently than those at home - on 13 days a month compared with 11.<br>A regular Australian survey of most-visited sites showed few similarities to the US-centred Media Matrix one.<br>The Where Did We Go survey in its look at global sites most visited by Australians last week said that Yahoo was on top here too, but after that the similarities with Media Matrix figures dropped away.<br>Media Matrix's top five were Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Netscape and Geocities.<br>By comparison, Where Did We Go's top five visited by Australian surfers were: Yahoo, Geocities, Hotmail, Microsoft and ICQ. AOL was 17th and MSN ninth.<br>Media Matrix's Top 10<br>Yahoo<br>AOL<br>MSN<br>Netscape<br>Geocities<br>Go.com<br>Microsoft<br>Excite<br>Lycos<br>Angelfire<br>Where Did We Go Top 10<br>Yahoo<br>Geocities<br>Hotmail<br>Microsoft<br>ICQ<br>Netscape<br>White Pages<br>Comsec<br>MSN<br>ninemsn<br>Media Matrix: www.relevantknowledge.com.Where Did We Go:usrwww.mpx.com.au/ianw/<br></font></p>
