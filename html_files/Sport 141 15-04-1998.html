            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS might be an entirely predictable thing to say - but unpredictability makes sport the enormous entertainment it is.<br>Who could have predicted that Fremantle would have been so combative, making Sunday's western derby the best so far?<br>Some arrogant Eagles fans had gone so far as to say they would not attend because they could not bear to watch slaughter of the innocents.<br>If the Dockers could be as passionate against other opposition - that is if they could learn to hate other teams as much as the Eagles - they might even turn their season around.<br>And who could have predicted the Eagles would be so rattled, particularly against skinny little kids like Jess Sinclair and usually competent but hardly star performers like Jason Norrish or James Clement?<br>Sydney coach Rodney Eade would have watched the tape of the match with great interest in preparation for next Saturday night's clash with West Coast at the WACA.<br>Who could have predicted, by the way, that Geelong players would have found their old handbags to match the controversial new away jumpers at the SCG?<br>They made it look like Sydney was a team of 18 Paul Kellys when the ball had to be won, or 18 Andrew Dunkleys when defence was needed, or 18 Tony Locketts when goals were needed (which is just as well because Plugger is having trouble converting at his normal champion rate - all caused by the number of times his body has gone under the knife according to the surprisingly illuminating Mick McGuane in the Channel 7 commentary box).<br>Sometimes though, things are entirely predictable, and thus less entertaining and even irritating.<br>Sam Newman's weekly dig at Seven's Talking Footy on Channel 9's Footy Show is a case in point.<br>What has he got to fear? Talking Footy is a totally different package to the Footy Show. It is a serious look at football by three men - Bruce McAvaney, Mike Sheahan and Leigh Matthews - who do not resort to cheap shots, rude jokes or petulant asides to convey their love of the game.<br>In its own way it is as unpredictable as the football action it seeks to analyse.<br>On Monday, Sheahan was able to mention Newman without making a face or putting on a silly voice. The Footy Show, however, is now a lot like Newman - a sometimes funny full-grown adolescent who cannot change his ways.<br>It became popular because it was unpredictable. How outrageous would Sam be? What jokes would Trevor Marmalade tell? How silly could Doug Hawkins be?<br>Hawkins went to Seven where he is cutting his teeth as a fairly enjoyable expert commentator, Newman rarely varies his repertoire and Marmalade's conversion rate has fallen below Peter Sumich's at the end of his career.<br>Newman should worry more about his old team, Geelong.<br></font></p>
