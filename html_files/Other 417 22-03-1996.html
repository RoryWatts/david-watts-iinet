            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE other night a friend started to watch Star Trek, the Original, in bed. He had just taken his sandals off and was about to remove his black socks when the pizza delivery man rang the doorbell.<br>But before he could get to the door the e-mail alert sounded on the computer next to his bed. He knew it would be from an Internet acquaintance in Canada bearing the source code of a software program, written in arcane C++, which would allow him to view the source codes of a myriad of C++ programs.<br>His dilemma - let his only source of nourishment go cold; or let the program go unread and the e-mail unanswered.<br>The pizza won, just. He ate it over the keyboard, drooling at his new program.<br>Bits of anchovy and little prawns got stuck between the spacebar and the bottom row of keys eventually causing the keyboard to seize. My friend could work no more.<br>His was the short life of a Geek - the relatively new breed of people set to take over the world.<br>Their instrument of domination is the Internet, of which they are masters. Their deity is Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, one of America's richest men with a fortune variously estimated at between $13 billion and $20 billion.<br>Their weaknesses are:<br>?A good old-fashioned internecine feud over whether Gates is God; (a vocal minority of Geeks see him as the anti-Christ and his Microsoft as a wrecker of arcane computer gobbledegook. Windows 95 even allows housewives, people older than 30 and non-students to use computers, for goodness sake) ...<br>?An inability to look after themselves which means that if they move more than 30 minutes from a pizza delivery business they will die of starvation; or their unhygienic dwellings will gather so much dust and dirt that they will catch terrible diseases and die at the screen.<br>The Internet is an instrument for good. It contains much of the knowledge in the world.<br>A local phone call from Perth will get the average Net user the complete works of Shakespeare, the entire Bible, whatever version of the Koran they desire or George Bernard Shaw's most quotable quotes.<br>Geeks eschew this knowledge. They know the Net better than anyone. They invented it in the late 60s so that universities and government departments could communicate with each other.<br>What they wanted to communicate was electronic games, the minutiae of Star Trek (or Babylon Five) trivia and software so obscure only they could do anything with it.<br>Now they have mellowed. Geeks have their own code, a squiggle of hieroglyphics they attach to their e-mail which describes the sort of Geek they are.<br>And they have released details of this hitherto secret code to the world - on the Internet of course.<br>The heresy of it is that the code is so all-embracing that ordinary people (those who eat three meals a day and spend more time in front of TV than the computer) can be described in Geek Code.<br>Here is an edited example of Geek code, followed by its translation.<br>GG d++ s+ a39 C++ W++ N++ w--- M++ PS+ PE(++) t+(++) e++ h<br>This means: The bearer of this Geek Code is 39, works in government, has a Masters degree, dresses in a suit, is taller than average, logs on to the Net first thing in the morning, has a home page on the Net and surfs every day, thinks Star Trek is a fine TV show and one of the only good things on, has a liveable house which even has furniture for Geek friends to sit on when they tear themselves away from the screen to visit.<br>No one is allowed to give much more detail about the code than that. It is copyright and cracking it is a vital part of being a Geek.<br>Yet its broad sweep of definitions appears to show a crack in Geekdom that might allow significant proportions of non-Geeks to use the code to identify themselves on the Net.<br>The mind boggles at the possibilities if Geek Code cracking becomes widespread. Does it mean a pretty boy like Tom Cruise will be able to declare himself a Geek?<br>Will British Prime Minister John Major be able to shake off the Nerd image and make the leap to Geekdom?<br>Will it give Prime Minister John Howard an excuse for his haircut and choice of suits?<br>If we can all be Geeks, what will be the point of thinking Geeks are weird, computer- obsessed Nerds out of touch with the real world?<br>A new category will arise. And I confidently predict it will be that great, great Australian character, the Dag - those unfortunate people who are nice enough but who have a terrible propensity for stuffing things up.<br>Like Alexander Downer, Ralph Willis, Prince Charles or Kramer (from TV's Seinfeld).<br>Dagdom here we come.<br>pse use this second correction<br>?David Watts is a bit Geeky and has an e-mail address: watto@iinet.net.au as well as a World Wide Web page http://www.iinet.net.au/~watto/.<br></font></p>
