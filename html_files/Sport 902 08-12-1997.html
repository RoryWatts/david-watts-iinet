            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE one-day game is not cricket. It looks like it, but it is finally time to admit that television and marketing has created a new sport.<br>Why else would a bowler of full tosses and a cross-batted hoiker like Ian Harvey, of Victoria, be called to the national team?<br>Why would Michael Bevan, a failure at Test level, be regarded suddenly as the big hope for Australia?<br>And it has to be said: why would the world's best gloveman, Ian Healy, be shocked off the international stage by WA's Adam Gilchrist?<br>The answer is easy ... this is not proper cricket. But before you think this article condemns the game or sniffs at it as an inferior thing, let me say that one-dayers are good in many ways.<br>?They are entertaining.<br>?They produce results.<br>?They allow players with genuine talent their time on the world stage.<br>?And they draw big crowds.<br>As Bill Lawry rightly said at the start of yesterday's Australia-New Zealand clash at the packed Adelaide Oval: ?The one-day game has been the financial saviour of cricket around the world.?<br>These are all good reasons to think highly of one-dayers. The hardest thing for lovers of traditional cricket to admit is that without this slap and tickle there may not be Tests.<br>And Tests are what cricket is all about. Take for example the last day of Australia-NZ from Hobart last Monday.<br>Stephen Fleming's adventurous declaration paved the way for first the Kiwis, then the Australians to try to win. In the end, NZ defended grimly, forcing a draw. Not a run was scored for the last half hour. Perversely, Lawry was never more accurate when he uttered his signature tune of ?It's all happening?, when to the uninformed nothing was happening. That's Test cricket, often as dense and complicated as life itself, full of statistics and memories.<br>The same Lawry shouts, ?It's all happening? often during one-dayers. What is happening is often full tosses, ugly agricultural sweeps, odd field placings, bad running, panicky fielding and predictable slow-medium bowling.<br>Put it all together and it's not cricket. It does satisfy people who like instant entertainment though. It requires minimum concentration but offers few memorable or worthy statistics.<br>As Richard Hinds wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday: ?Who won the 1986-87 World Series Cup? Name the man of the match in the first round-robin game between Australia and the West Indies last summer? What number did Michael Di Venuto wear on Thursday night?? The answers: Don't know, couldn't care less and can't remember.?<br>Try these against: what was Bradman's last score in Tests? How many wickets did Lillee take in his Test career? What was Greg Chappell's score in his first Test innings at Perth in 1970? Real cricket lovers will know: 0, 355 and 108. And they really care.<br>But everyone needs a rest from the serious life. Turn on the TV, turn off the brain and enjoy.<br></font></p>
