            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH cyberspace comedian Todd Shilkin has launched an updated Web Page devoted to all things seriously funny.<br>Readers will remember Mr Shilkin from the WestWeb story last week.<br>The site features a comprehensive list of links to funny sites across the Net, guaranteed to keep Internauts laughing. Also, find out how to make history in Todd's Interactive Comedy Novel.<br>???<br>AUSTRALIAN Net users just love telephone numbers, judging by the statistics at a Sydney Web site which tracks the most visited pages here and overseas.<br>Where Did We Go Last Week has been set up by Sydney ISP Peter Lake to track the most popular sites on the Web. Telstra's White Pages is in third spot and the Yellow Pages are ninth. The Australasian mirror of the rapid search engine AltaVista is No. 1.<br>AltaVista resides at the Yellow Pages site.<br>Mr Lake's listings appear to indicate the Web is a fact-finding medium for most. The top 15 sites visited are dominated by media, finance and company pages. Only one gaming site - hyperactive - makes it.<br>And there are no adult-only sites until No. 35, the Rosie Ozsex page, which is a subscription-only site.<br>Mr Lake's site uses proxy cache statistics for about 5 million hits a week to compile his lists. The rankings do not include visits to Australian sites from outside Australia.<br>ISP Web sites, which typically become users' default home pages when they sign up, have been removed from the list too, as have visits to .edu domains.<br>???<br>THE HotDog Pro HTML editor is aiming for a big comeback with its latest version 3.0.21 just released by makers Sausage Software.<br>HotDog started brilliantly two years ago, but an overloaded, noisy and cumbersome release last year lost many friends, WestWeb among them.<br>Smaller, easier programs like Homesite have raced into the conventional HTML editor market, making HotDog's recovery much harder.<br>Its latest editor for Windows95 and NT 4.0 is a solid performer with dozens of features.<br>The most important is a wizard for creating Style Sheets, which allow greater flexibility in site creation.<br>URLs<br>Seriously Funny - www.iinet.net.au/-funnyguy<br>Where did we go last week? - usrwww.mpx.com.au/-ianw/<br>HotDog Pro 3.0.21 - www.sausage.com.au<br></font></p>
