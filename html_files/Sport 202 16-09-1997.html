            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TV VIEWERS could not complain about the football on display in the classic North Melbourne-West Coast semi-final on Saturday.<br>The commentary was a different matter, however. It was Wayne Carey-obsessed and North-obsessed.<br>Fair enough if you were a Roos supporter, and you might think fair enough if you only read the result - North by 13 points.<br>But the game was a far different matter.<br>It was a gallant exit by the Eagles, who dominated for more than half the match before running out of fit players and options.<br>North skipper Carey tore Geelong apart a week earlier and there was an obvious focus on him by the big Channel 7 team early against the Eagles, particularly the clash with his nemesis Glen Jakovich.<br>The Eagles strongman removed Carey as a factor within 15 minutes. You might have expected the Seven boys, especially Bruce McAvaney and Leigh Matthews, to have a good hard look at the rest of the talent on display and begin analysing the impact of West Coast's Dean Kemp, Peter Matera and surprise packet Brendon Fewster.<br>They did, but only in passing. It was Carey this and Corey McKernan that right through to half-time and beyond.<br>No one doubts this pair are vital to the Roos, but they are not the entire team. Bruising backman Martin Pike was arguably far more instrumental in Saturday's fightback than even McKernan.<br>The Seven focus on Carey and McKernan takes too much away from the rest of the Roos, who are simply too good to disregard for an historic consecutive flag.<br>The Carey-McKernan obsession also took something away from a brave West Coast fight.<br>Written off by most experts - only Dennis Cometti and Adrian Barich of the big TV team picked them - the Eagles were simply stunning right up to the time of Jarrad Schofield's injury (was it really necessary to show the sickening fall in slow motion at least half a dozen times?).<br>The Eagles young brigade had a lot to do with the pluck and fight. They also had a lot to do with the fade-out.<br>After Phil Matera's two misses, followed by muffed shots by Michael Gardiner and Ben Cousins, Cometti's telling verdict was: ?Youth has not been able to deliver.?<br>Not this time, perhaps, but the signs look good for next year.<br>The other obsession that spoilt this great confrontation was the one many non-Victorians find hardest to stomach: the promotion of the game as the VFL defending against interstate marauders.<br>The closing song for the finals is Seven Was There and it comes complete with fine footage like Jezza's mark and the emotional farewell to Ted Whitten.<br>But over the top of the joyous 1992 Eagles win are the words: ?I was there when West Coast took the flag away.?<br>Away from what? This is a national competition, Seven, not the VFL in a Melbourne ruled by the Roo Boy.<br></font></p>
