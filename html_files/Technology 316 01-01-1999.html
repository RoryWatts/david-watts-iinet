            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT ALL started with a simple request but ended with a lump in the throat. A correspondent in an e-mail discussion group wanted to find information online for a neighbour who was keen to see whether she could obtain a copy of a CD by the relatively unknown late blues singer Ted Hawkins.<br>The neighbour believed Hawkins had a CD called I Love You.<br>So I plunged in even though I had never heard of Hawkins. I had the optimistic feeling the Web was probably the exact place to look for something a little musically obscure.<br>First - and as it turned out, only - stop to make a text search for the name Ted Hawkins was CDNow, a site that holds countless words about musicians and their music, especially if it is on CD, and especially if it can be flogged online to a credit card holder.<br>I struck pay dirt within seconds and found what could have been the album. It was called I Love You Most of All, rather than just I Love You, and could be ordered for $US15.49 by the press of a few keys and the filling in of a few forms.<br>Good deed done, I lingered at CDNow and decided to plug in the name of a singer I greatly admired and, though not as unknown as Hawkins, certainly more a cult figure than a pop one.<br>I searched for Tim Buckley, who died of a heroin overdose at the age of 28 in 1975.<br>CDNow returned information on all Buckley's albums, their songs - some of which could be played online with RealAudio - and several links to Buckley worship pages.<br>Such sites for non-household names are everywhere on the Web. Last year I even found one to Bob Lind, who wrote and sang just one hit, Bright, Elusive Butterfly.<br>Buckley's brilliant vocal range - said to be five octaves - plus the way he straddled the genres of rock, blues, gospel and folk mean he has a big cyber-following.<br>The tragic nature of his death also ensures a certain romanticism, particularly as my memory at the time was that Buckley fans blamed a CIA conspiracy.<br>This gossip turns out to be just that when you read the wealth of material about Buckley at the Tim Buckley Archives. Not only has it got dozens of interviews, reviews and profiles of the singer, it has a comprehensive index of press reports about his death and the subsequent charging of a UCLA music professor with assisting in the death by providing the drug.<br>A link from the Archives took me to a little goldmine called We'll Always Remember, a collection of obituaries of rock stars.<br>Tim Buckley is there but not Ted Hawkins as far as I could see.<br>The cast of rock'n'roll heaven is pretty big. There are biographies, discographies and links to fan sites for the following (to name a few):<br>John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly, Michael Hutchence, Kurt Cobain, Mama Cass, Marc Bolan, Karen Carpenter, Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Bob Marley, Sid Vicious and Frank Zappa.<br>And Tim Buckley's name is bracketed with Jeff Buckley, who released just one album, Grace, before drowning at the age of 30 in 1997.<br>Jeff Buckley was Tim Buckley's son from his first, short marriage as a teenager in the 60s.<br>It was a fascinating if sad exploration of the Web's ability to serve up information woven together - mostly for free - by its users.<br>Links:<br>CDNow: www.cdnow.com<br>Unofficial Ted Hawkins Home Page:<br>www.the-bunker.demon.co.uk/ted.html<br>Tim Buckley Archives: pantheon.cis.yale.edu/bodoin/tbarchives.html<br>We'll Always Remember - obituaries of rock stars:<br>www.hotshotdigital.com/WellAlwaysRemember.html<br></font></p>
