            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIA is on the verge of Internet censorship because few politicians understand the medium, according to leading fighters against content regulation legislation introduced last month by Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston.<br>They say politicians, with a few exceptions, either do not use the Net or equate it with TV or telephones.<br>Paul McCutcheon, an executive member of the WA Internet Association, and Danny Yee, Sydney-based spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia, spoke out in the wake of a Senate committee's acceptance of the legislation.<br>They made their comments in interviews with The West Australian before Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine declared he would not support the GST.<br>Critics have claimed the censorship legislation was intended to appeal to Senator Harradine's moral views and win his vote on the GST.<br>The fate of the censorship legislation is now unclear, but Mr Yee said at the weekend the battle against it would still be fought.<br>?The pressure for censorship is not just Harradine-driven. The social conservatives in the coalition wield considerable power,? he said.<br>Mr McCutcheon was scathing about political ignorance of online matters. ?Our elected representatives don't care, or place any significance, on the views of Internet users,? he said.<br>The Senate committee ignored more than a hundred applications in its final decision which gives the green light to blocking and filtering of adult content plus the imposition of heavy fines against service providers and users.<br>Mr McCutcheon said the minority report from Labor went a long way towards taking notice of the submissions. But the best understanding of users' concerns came in the dissenting report of Democrat Senator Natasha Stott Despoja.<br>Both men agreed if the censorship regime was enacted it would lead to slower, more costly access for users because of the imposition of blocking technologies.<br>They also agreed that attempts to weed out offensive sites and rate them on the same basis as films and TV would give parents and guardians the false impression the Net had been cleaned up.<br>Both men hit out at Senator Alston's drive to introduce the legislation in only a few weeks with limited time for public comment. They also attacked his political motives and his claims that the legislation was to protect children from paedophiles and bomb-makers saying he had misrepresented the online community and the content available on the Net.<br>Mr Yee said politicians had badly misjudged community concerns. There was little evidence the general population wanted Net censorship.<br>?The silent majority (non-Net users) isn't going to remember this legislation next election, but a good few of the Net community might. The online community is probably more influential, too.?<br>Both men agreed the effectiveness of online campaigning needed to be looked at. The fight against the legislation had so far been vocal and unified on the Net, but Senator Alston had barely acknowledged it.<br>Mr McCutcheon said while politicians such as Senator Stott Despoja and Labor's Kate Lundy could teach their colleagues the benefits of the medium, they were hamstrung by having to fight against a ?media-induced paranoia surrounding the Internet?.<br>HELP DESK:<br>Senate report: www.saia.asn.au<br>EFA censorship campaign: www.efa.org.au/<br>Campaigns/99.html<br>WAIA resources: www.waia.asn.au/Issues/<br>Regulation/DCITA/<br></font></p>
