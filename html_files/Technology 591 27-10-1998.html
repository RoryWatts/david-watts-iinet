            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">JAVASCRIPT is a doddle; so are cascading style sheets ... it's placing a link on a Web page that causes the trouble.<br>These are three very quick impressions after a day of testing the newest version of Allaire's exciting HTML editor, Homesite 4.0.<br>Homesite made its debut just over two years ago and has not been out of the top five lists of HTML editors since.<br>Its newest version reaffirms its dominance of the market for editors aimed at Web page authors who can write code.<br>The only slip-up with this latest version appears to be the inclusion of a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) mode.<br>It is the area, where try as I might, I could not see how to place a Web link.<br>One easy tab back to the old-fashioned, longhand coding screen solved that.<br>But why go WYSIWYG with such an accomplished editor anyway, particularly when products like Microsoft Front Page do this ?Web authoring for novices? so well?<br>Homesite's strong suite has always been its speed and flexibility for more experienced HTML writers. If it wanted to compete with Front Page, it would have to stretch its resources very thin and risk weakening a brilliant product.<br>For - WYSIWYG aside - that is what Homesite continues to be: a brilliant product.<br>It maintains its ascendancy by continually adding the latest features needed to produce good Web pages without sacrificing its clean and easy interface, or its speed.<br>In fact, version 4.0 in its beta testing release seems even faster than the previous version 3.0, despite adding dozens of features that should really be weighing it down.<br>One of those is a beautifully simple script editor that allows a rank Java novice to add bells and whistles like a veteran in seconds.<br>One of the things I like in a HTML editor is the ability to construct a reasonable Web page in 10 or so minutes without having to resort to the help file.<br>Homesite passed this test easily, with the bonus that I was able to include a drop-down menu of sites in less than a minute.<br>While constructing a page, Homesite offered plenty of easy-to-follow help at every stage. There are wizards for most functions which will make this version of the editor fairly accessible to the novice who is keen to learn what HTML is - a facility not easily granted by many WYSIWYG editors.<br>If you are a confident HTML author, there is no need to follow wizards or help boxes (though ones that give choices behind the many tags are worth looking at when in doubt).<br>The ability to customise the already attractive interface is also a drawcard for Homesite.<br>You can now rearrange any of the tabbed or standard toolbars, or even drag them off as floating tool palettes. You can also customise any of the toolbars with standard commands or ones you create yourself.<br>Homesite's resource bar - a set of tabbed windows running down the left side of the screen - adds a couple of new options.<br>The Site View shows a graphical representation of your pages and elements. The Tag Inspector gives you quick access to all the attributes of any tag you click in the edit window.<br>According to Web giants cnet, who recently voted Homesite the top editor for experienced users, other positive features include:<br>?Tag Definitions Library, which lets you edit existing tags and add your own.<br>?Tag Completion - pop-up list boxes with the attributes of the code you are typing (you can turn it off).<br>?The new Visual Tools Object Model that lets you script actions within Homesite using VBScript or JavaScript.<br>Homesite 4.0 also includes the ability to write shortcut keys or coding templates for regularly-used commands.<br>A 30-day free trial version is available. Homesite costs about $150 to register.<br>Download and more information from: www.allaire.com<br></font></p>
