            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE future of Internet censorship in Australia is up in the air, with a Federal-State battle possible.<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority recommended on Friday a non-interventionist policy for the regulation of cyberspace.<br>Federal Communications and Arts Minister Richard Alston accepted the recommendations and said he would move quickly to have them implemented.<br>He would form an advisory body to set up the mechanisms of a code of conduct, complaints procedure and Net self-regulation.<br>And he asked the States for their co-operation.<br>But the ABA recommendations left a hole as far as criminal charges for allowing minors to see objectionable material are concerned.<br>The ABA report referred only to an industry code of conduct providing defences for criminal procedures. This would allow States to frame their own criminal codes regarding Net behaviour unless the Federal Government took that role.<br>Paul McCutcheon, president of the WA Internet Association, said yesterday that Senator Alston's acceptance of the ABA report meant that the Federal Government now faced a test of will to see whether it wanted to control censorship matters, an issue which appeared to be moving back to State control.<br>If the Federal Government decided to leave censorship charges to the States, WA would benefit, Mr McCutcheon said. Unlike most States the WA Government appeared to be well advised about the Internet and had good, non-threatening legislation on the books.<br>The fly in the ointment is this week's Attorneys-General meeting in Canberra where NSW will put forward its planned legislation - regarded by Net users as draconian and ignorant - as a model for all States.<br>Mr McCutcheon said that WA Family Affairs Minister Cheryl Edwardes could see massive problems with the NSW plans and, after the ABA recommendations and the defeat of the US Communications and Decency Act on the grounds of free speech, regarded the NSW plans as a dead issue.<br>But she must enlist the support of other States to nullify the NSW plans. Sources say that Mrs Edwardes may be able to count on SA, Victoria and the Northern Territory to help stop NSW Attorney-General Jeff Shaw pushing the case for laws which Net users say would ?turn the Internet into a kindergarten?.<br>Reaction throughout Australia to the ABA report has been positive.<br>Censorship fighters Electronic Frontiers Australia have welcomed it for the knowledge and enlightened attitude it has to the Net. But the EFA says it is worried that the recommendations give too much power to the ABA as a regulatory body.<br>?We are concerned that far too many of the recommendations are concerned with bureaucratic intervention, for example ABA involvement in an online labelling task force, monitoring of codes of practice, complaints handling, research to monitor the introduction of online technologies into Australian homes and stimulus of Australian content development,? the EFA said.<br>?While we recognise a valid and continuing role for ABA in content regulation policy development, we consider that their level of involvement as proposed has been influenced far too much by their background in broadcasting industry regulation.?<br>The Australian Computer Society welcomed the ABA findings.<br></font></p>
