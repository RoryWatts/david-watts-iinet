            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BILL GATES has a vision of the future that puts the world in a rosy, smart, high-tech garden.<br>His latest book, The Road Ahead, with a brilliant accompanying CD-ROM, speaks with unequivocal glee about interactive television, wallet-sized personal computers, smart houses which set temperature, music and light to your idea of perfection; a world shrunk by the Internet and high bandwidth communications that allow voice and video to travel together at great speed and unthought of clarity.<br>It should become a school textbook, if not for its amazing thought and vision, then for the possibility that everything Mr Gates says goes wrong.<br>The Road Ahead is no joke. It is written by one of the real geniuses of our time and he has the wherewithal - a fortune estimated at $13 billion - to propel his dreams.<br>That Mr Gates is an optimist there is no doubt. For example:<br>?I'm optimistic about the impact of new technology. It will enhance leisure time and enrich culture by expanding the distribution of information.<br>?It will relieve pressure on natural resources because increasing numbers of products will be able to take the form of bits (of data) rather than of manufactured goods.?<br>This last bit is the type of utterance bound to give less technologically visionary people (probably 99 per cent of us) pause for thought.<br>It rocks the foundations of a traditional manufacturing society. We make things to make money to live. Mr Gates predicts something far different.<br>He is doubtless a guru and says The Road Ahead is meant as a discussion starter as to where the future is heading.<br>He does not really attempt to pinpoint solutions to the problems that information technology can and will cause - job displacement, copyright infringement and cultural diversity.<br>Video watching takes on new meaning. Customised and interactive television means a video night can also be linked to shopping and education.<br>?If you are watching the movie Top Gun,? Mr Gates says, ?and think Tom Cruise's aviation sunglasses look really cool, you'll be able to pause the movie and learn about the glasses or even buy them on the spot if the film has been tagged with commercial information.?<br>The CD also contains videos of how future technology might work in homes, business and schools, and there's also a video tour of Mr Gates' $30 million state-of-the-art home in Seattle.<br></font></p>
