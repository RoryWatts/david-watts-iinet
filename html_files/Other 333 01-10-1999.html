            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THANKS to television, we all know what we have to do on November 6. We have to hop in our cars, drive to the nearest T-junction, then turn in the direction we would like the country to go.<br>Sounds dead easy and very Australian. Obviously U-turns or ram raids straight through the signs at the T-junction will result in informal votes.<br>We have to say yes or no to whether we want a republic with an Australian at the helm instead of Queen Elizabeth II and her successors from the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Windsor-Mountbatten family.<br>Personally, I'm a republican, but there is one thing that might make me change my mind on November 6 and turn in the No direction. If we could somehow oust the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Windsor-Mountbattens as the royal family and bring back a much more interesting family, the Plantagenets, then I would gladly put aside republicanism.<br>Now I have nothing but admiration for the gracious way Elizabeth II goes about reigning. And the example of her father George VI and the wonderful Queen Mum in refusing to flee war-torn London should be a lesson in character to us all.<br>But it is all a bit too nice. What is needed is a ruthless, warmongering, whoremongering, brave, beastly and bawdy set of royals. What we have is a family beset by domestic troubles. What we need is a family to make us quake in our boots, to make us feel alive . . . and be bloody grateful that we are.<br>There was no one better than the Plantagenets for this.<br>Right from the start of the line with Henry II in 1154 to the grisly end with Richard III at Bosworth Field in 1485, this royal family kept its subjects on their toes.<br>Henry II was blamed for the murder of Thomas Beckett, the Archbishop of Canterbury; imprisoned his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine and fought wars against most of his sons. He also took several mistresses and produced many bastard offspring.<br>And he was regarded only as moderately interesting and indeed revered for his intellect and energy.<br>One of his sons was Richard the Lionheart, a legend. Another was Prince John, a dastardly piece of work, who as all fans of Robin Hood know, was a thief and a liar.<br>Further on down the line is Henry V, gallant and brave almost beyond words who thumped the French and who was honoured by Shakespeare with one of his greatest speeches - "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more . . . ?, it started. And ?Cry "God for Harry, England, and St George',? it ended.<br>For sheer black-hearted badness one just has to look at Edward II whose means of maintaining power was based on the noose and the block - 28 knights and barons were executed for rebelling against the decadent king. He was a lousy soldier - Robert the Bruce took back much of Scotland from him. And Edward was a horror of a husband. On his wedding day he opted for the bed of his homosexual lover rather than that of his bride.<br>No wonder she and her lover rebelled, captured Edward and had him put to death by means of a red-hot poker.<br>But he was a lamb compared with Richard III, who had his nephews imprisoned in the Tower of London and murdered and who took his brother's widow as his wife. His best press comes from Shakespeare, who simply portrays Richard as a monster.<br>They don't make royal families like that any more. Chances of a Plantagenet takeover here in Australia seem remote, however.<br>No one with the surname is listed in the White Pages anywhere in WA or in the capital cities.<br>Royal geneaology information held at the University of Hull in Britain claims: ?The Plantagenet line sunk so low that the great-granddaughter of Margaret Plantagenet (last of that royal family) married a joiner and her son was a mender of old shoes.?<br>Horrors . . . looks like a republic for me.<br></font></p>
