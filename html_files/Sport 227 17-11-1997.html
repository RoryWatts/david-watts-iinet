            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT SEEMS quiet in couch potato land. No Test cricket, no grand slam tennis, no spring racing; most of all no footy.<br>But that is just an illusion because we armchair sports lovers have never had it so good.<br>At the weekend, for example, we could have seen international rugby union between Australia and England, international rugby league between Australia and Great Britain, the Australian Women's Open golf, soccer from England, soccer from Italy, a little home-grown stuff (but not enough), and the ATP tennis tournament.<br>Much was on late, but it was still on. Some of it - like the 15-all rugby union draw - was not all that good because of greasy balls and nervous novices. For those in the 40-plus age bracket this much high-calibre sport on TV would seem almost sinful compared with what they grew up with in the days of black and white.<br>I was dragged up in Queensland so I don't really know what you Sandgropers regarded as televised sport back then, but I assume it was similar.<br>The earliest memory is Sheffield Shield live from the Gabba after tea each day - and they did not play on Sundays. This was 1962-63 and it would have been a mortal sin.<br>Coverage was accomplished with one camera. It was hard to tell who was who because it was so far away - no close-ups - and cricketers of that era all looked the same in baggy caps and spotless, baggy creams.<br>A landline enabling live coverage from interstate did not come into play until the 1965-66 Ashes series. By this time about three cameras covered the game and it was possible to discern the features of Bob Cowper as he carved out 307 at the MCG. Rugby League is tailor-made for TV with its smaller arena and fast movement. Test matches against Great Britain were shown live from Brisbane and Sydney in 1966. The abiding memory is of one fixed camera behind the goalposts in the Brisbane Test, forcing viewers to look beyond the borders of the TV set when play moved fast and wide to the wings.<br>My only memory of real footy is seeing Ron Barassi on a daily children's show explaining the intricacies of the code. He called himself ?Uncle Ron? and caused a stir in the studio when he swapped his Melbourne jumper for a Carlton one. We Queensland kiddies looked on mystified. It made as much sense as a Turkish documentary.<br>One day we in Perth might have AFL and cricket channels on pay-TV to complement the free-to-air sportsfest - those two channels are with Optus Vision which is not available here.<br>There appears to be too many players for the small Australian market.<br>Britain started with two suppliers who soon merged, forming yet another Rupert Murdoch-controlled conglomerate called BSkyB.<br>We might end up with Optel or Foxtus. No matter the result, life on the couch is going to be very sporty.<br></font></p>
