            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ON A Perth weekend made in heaven it was positively sinful to stay indoors to watch sport on the box. But some of us had to do it.<br>At this time of the year there is not that much about - but this turned out to be a blessing for Channel Nine's Wide World of Sports on Saturday.<br>The hyperactive show was forced to concentrate its considerable resources on one event, Cox Plate day at Moonee Valley.<br>Unlike Caulfield Cup day last week, there was no cutting away to the motorcycle grand prix, no chopping and changing. This enabled viewers with concentration spans greater than that of a gnat to soak up a top day and enjoy an excellent coverage.<br>It was a message to the WWOS team that it needs only to focus on one sport, rather than just give edited - often lunatic - highlights, to provide good television.<br>The nature of tight, little Moonee Valley and the quality of horseflesh made the day memorable. Cameras were able to get so close you could almost smell the turf and sweat. You could certainly hear the crowd.<br>That the actual Cox Plate, even with only eight starters, was such a fantastic race, was a bonus.<br>Saintly won by a lip, diving under Filante's head on the line after drifting at the tight home turn and seemingly going out of contention.<br>The interview with ecstatic jockey Darren Beadman as he rode back to the saddling enclosure was beautifully frank and refreshing.<br>Beadman dedicated the win to God - he is a devout Christian - and delivered one of sport's most quotable quotes this year: ?We're a heavenly combination.?<br>Equally good value was Saintly's trainer Bart Cummings. It is really no surprise that the ?cups king? is a little shy of TV cameras. They do show all too clearly what a shrewd old owl he is.<br>And he is a man of action rather than words. Asked by the busy Ann-Marie Sparkman before the race what he thought of the form of his charges, Cummings said: ?I just watch 'em and clock 'em. Everyone else talks about them.?<br>Nine's coverage was enhanced by flashbacks to previous Plates, particularly the three successive wins of the great Kingston Town.<br>This may have been little more than an extended plug for a book called The King, by journalist Graeme Kelly, but it was well done.<br>The downside of the day was Simon O'Donnell's continual blathering about Octagonal and the boring Sydney-Melbourne rivalry of the battalion of commentators, highlighted when Crying Game of WA was introduced as the ?only non-Sydney horse in the field?.<br>???<br>SAD news for all tennis watchers - particularly men - is the premature retirement of the Argentine rose Gabriela Sabatini at the age of 26.<br>Sabatini was a must-see, even when not playing well. At Wimbledon in 1990 rain forced many matches to outside courts, offering the rare pleasure of Sabatini and Stefi Graf playing doubles for anyone walking past.<br>Graf, the champion, was escorted by a sole security guard back to the changerooms. But Sabatini required a dozen and was mobbed.<br></font></p>
