            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Americans often challenge the boundaries of what we have come to accept as the norm. Last week a company called Hollywood Forever announced it was about to blur the distinction between life and death.<br>The company bought the dilapidated Hollywood Memorial Park cemetery for $375,000 at a bankruptcy sale earlier this year.<br>It just so happens that in this cemetery lie some quite dead household names, including Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks senior, Tyrone Power, Peter Finch and Charlie Chaplin.<br>About 400, shall we say residents, are regarded as celebrities among the permanent population of 77,000. And Hollywood Forever, with modern technology, has decided that the likes of Chaplin and Valentino will have no peace.<br>It is planned that sound-proof kiosks around the grounds will show virtual reality tombstones, digitized memorabilia, photographs, film clips and narrative about the lives of the stars.<br>If you now cannot be certain of the difference between life and death, what hope have we punters in coming to grips with the difference between TV and computers when the digital TV revolution starts?<br>Right now it is pretty easy. A TV is something you turn on, and generally veg out in front of while it wafts its messages over you. A computer you also turn on, wait a bit for it to boot, then tackle a wide variety of tasks.<br>If the computer is on the Internet you can be entertained and/or appalled, but you can rarely be passive - unless you are downloading a 15Mb Internet Explorer update.<br>The differences are stark. But when digital signals are beamed in to your set, you will be able to receive Internet signals as well. What will you do? Stay on the couch and flick the remote like always, or use the promised expanded capacity and tap in URLs or e-mail addresses to enhance the viewing experience?<br>Although it is not digital TV, a growing band of American customers - and now some in Britain - are experiencing the convergence of computer and TV with the Microsoft-controlled WebTV.<br>A set-top box allows both television (through the air) and Internet (via the phone) signals to be displayed on the TV.<br>Here is what customers - albeit a sample carefully selected by WebTV - are saying:<br>n"I love my WebTV to do my banking and investment research.?<br>n"Because I travel a lot, I use WebTV to find the best airfares and restaurants.?<br>n"WebTV gives you whatever you are into - whatever you are interested in looking for, it is there.?<br>n"I like that I don't have to get on a computer to enjoy the Internet. It's more fun to sit on the couch.?<br>n"With WebTV, I feel that the kids will grow up with the TV being more interactive with them instead of something you just sit in front of. I like it because [TV] seems more educational now.?<br>The signs seem promising. But perhaps TV could pick up a few improvements that Web surfers have come to expect before convergence arrives.<br>The following examples are from USA Today's digital TV special:<br>nThe TV should have either a menu of channels or your nominated favourite channel - think of home pages - when it is turned on.<br>nYou should be able to use a back button or display a history of programs instead of just clicking on channel numbers so you can surf to your desired spots just like on the Web.<br>nYou should have the ability to store programs in a cache so you can watch them when you want, not when some programming executive says you can.<br>Remember, on your PC on the Net you get your ?channel? (site) when you want and once there you can choose whatever you want to see.<br>The ultimate question is whether you want to be a couch potato or a mouse potato.<br></font></p>
