            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN 1976 demented TV newsman Howard Beale screamed: ?I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.?<br>Beale was not real. He was a character played so powerfully by Australia's own Peter Finch in the film, Network, that Finch won a posthumous Oscar.What he screamed out his apartment window was appealing; summing up the anxiety, stress and frustration of modern life.<br>And there wasn't even that much junk mail then, nor telephone marketing.<br>Just think what Beale might have yelled if he lived today, even in peaceful old Perth instead of some decaying US urban sprawl.He probably would not be able to speak, let alone scream, he would be so mad as hell.<br>And aren't you? Consider the scene: you are in the shower, or just pouring a nice wine to go with an eagerly anticipated dinner. The phone rings. Hello, is that (fill in name grabbed from phone book); how are you this evening; this is Sky (or Blaze or Anthea or some dishy name); I'm doing a survey for (fill in name of totally disreputable mob who are too lazy to do business properly).<br>What do you do? I try to keep it short, without becoming too rude.Others I know become beguiled and end up taking part in five-minute interviews during which they give away personal details up to and including mother's maiden name.<br>But there is a way - actually several ways - out.Recently an Internet correspondent - curiously a demented TV newsman himself - circulated a list of ways to deal with these tele-marketers, or phone pests.<br>Here are some of the methods to stop madness:<br>1: If you get one of those pushy people who won't shut up, just listen to their sales pitch. When they try to close the sale, tell them that you'll need to go get your credit card. Then, just set the phone down and do the laundry, shopping or whatever. See how long they wait for you to get your credit card.<br>2: If they start with, ?How are you today?? say, ?Why do you want to know?? Or you can say, ?I'm so glad you asked, because no one seems to care these days and I have all these problems, my sciatica is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died . . .? When they try to get back to the sales process, just continue relating your problems.<br>3. Ask the phone pest to spell his or her name, then ask them to spell their company's name, then ask where it is located. Continue asking personal questions or questions about the company for as long as necessary.<br>4. This one works better if you are male: Tele-marketer: ?Hi, my name is Julie and I'm with ABC Services?. You: ?Hang on a second.? (short pause) ?Okay, (in a really husky voice) what are you wearing??<br>5: Cry out, in pleasure and surprise, ?Julie! Is this really you? I can't believe it! Julie, how have you been??<br>6: Say, ?no?, over and over. Vary the sound of each no, and keep an even tempo even as they're trying to speak.<br>7: Let the person go through their spiel, occasionally muttering ?oh, really?, or ?uh-huh?. When they ask you to buy, ask them to marry you.<br>Finally, and this is the best:<br>8: Tell the tele-marketer you are busy and if they will give you their phone number you will call them back. If they say they are not allowed to give out their number, then ask them for their home number and tell them you will call them at home. . . at dinnertime.<br>I can't wait for the phone to ring.<br></font></p>
