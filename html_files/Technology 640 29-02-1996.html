            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SUPPORTERS of jailed political activist Albert Langer are using the Internet to protest about his case and to rally for his freedom.<br>They have posted on the electronic bulletin board, aus.politics, a letter they say was written by Langer in Melbourne's Pentridge Prison this week.<br>Langer is serving 10 weeks in Pentridge for encouraging voters to put both Labor and the coalition last in Saturday's Federal election, defying a court order.<br>Langer's letter says his sentence by Justice Beach confirms that authorities believe this election ?can change something?. Langer has argued that if elections could change anything, they would be made illegal.<br>But if enough people followed his advice and put the Government and Opposition last, then the system would change.<br>?Drawing upon the characterisation by Douglas Adams in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, my understanding is that free elections mean no more than the right to choose which "lizards' will misrepresent the people in Parliament,? Langer's letter says.<br>?The point of free elections is to confer legitimacy on lizard rule.?<br>Among Net users supporting Langer was this posting: ?My own view is that the voting method he has been advocating leads logically from his position of conscience that both major parties in Australia are equally as bad, and that a voter should give no encouragement to either of them.<br>?The voting method he advocates would result in the need for a re-election if the majority of voters adopted it, but more normally, would just result in the preferences of the voter not going to either of the major parties.<br>?This method of voting is formal, and the votes count, but in Australia it is illegal to advocate its use. Albert Langer has been jailed for refusing to obey a court order to cease advocating its use.?<br>Other Net users wrote emphatically that Langer should be freed.<br>But one, taking issue with Australian Democrat support for Langer, claimed the party was hypocritical because it would benefit most from Langer's advocated voting method.<br>The correspondent also attacked ?free Langer? advocates because Langer had been jailed for contempt and the umpire's rule had to be obeyed.<br>Another correspondent got the ball entirely in the wrong court. He said it was a shame that a fine footballer had been jailed ... he was referring to Brisbane Broncos' rugby league player Alan "Alfie' Langer.<br></font></p>
