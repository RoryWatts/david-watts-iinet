            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE-THIRD of respondents to a big US Internet survey say they falsify information on Web registration forms.<br>The sixth GVU survey by Georgia Tech college in the US surveyed 15,000 Net users in America and Europe about the World Wide Web. Results released late last month show that 33.5 per cent provided false information when registering at sites.<br>Most (66.5 per cent) said they gave wrong information less than a quarter of the time.<br>Registration at sites normally involves a user filling in a form which asks for e-mail address, name, age, gender, address and computer profile. Occasionally users are asked their profession and salary.<br>Registration is becoming more common, particularly among corporations trying to build demographic profiles of people inquiring about their services through the Net. Registration can also be used for accounting if a company decides to ask people to pay for Web-delivered goods.<br>The GVU survey did not say which type of information was falsified, but women were less likely than men to give misleading information.<br>GVU surveys have been carried out since 1994 making them one of the oldest regular sweeps of Net use.<br>The sixth survey, performed between October and December last year, found slower growth in Web use and virtually little change in the male-female ratio, which had changed rapidly in the preceding 12 months.<br>The average age of users is now 34.9, compared with the fourth survey (32.7) and fifth (33). Men outnumber women 69 to 31, a figure almost unchanged from the fifth survey in May last year.<br>But it is a radical change from the first survey in 1994 when the figure was 95 to 5.<br>By the third survey, in 1995, the ratio was 82 to 18.<br>Nearly half the respondents to the sixth survey (46 per cent) say the Net has made them feel more connected to people.<br>?This provides some evidence for the claim that the Internet is more than just an information source, rather it's building new communities based on common interests instead of common geographic locations,? GVU says in a summary.<br>This inter-connectedness appears to have no commercial implications. More than two-thirds say they are not willing to pay extra fees for Web services. Many say that by paying an Internet access provider they felt they had paid to check Web content.<br>?Respondents' unwillingness to pay may stem from their perception of the value of the information currently available on the Web and may change as people become used to high-quality professional sites,? GVU says.<br>The most common activity on the Web is still browsing (77.08 per cent) - virtually unchanged in the past three surveys. It is followed by entertainment (63.79 per cent), education (53.29 per cent) and work (50.9 per cent).<br>Compared with a year ago, shopping is up to 18.83 per cent from 11.1 per cent in the fourth survey and 14.91 per cent in the fifth survey.<br>The majority of respondents (63 per cent) access the Web from home. This is an increase from the fifth survey when the percentage was 55.4 per cent.<br>Although people use their browsers as often as in previous surveys, they now use them for longer times.<br>One in five users (20.05 per cent) reported using their browsers more than 20 hours a week. About one third (30.01 per cent) spent 10 to 20 hours a week on the Web, with 17 per cent spending seven to nine hours a week and 17.76 per cent spending four to six hours.<br></font></p>
