            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOME weekends we all lose. The Friday to Sunday just past was one of those rare, depressing times for WA sports lovers.<br>The Allies snuck back in against our state of origin AFL side, Tasmania made apple pie of our Westar Rules boys, the Wildcats went down in the NBL and the poor Perth Reds were demoralised in the Super League world club championship in Paris.<br>The Orioles won a rare victory in the National Netball League to restore a little parochial pride.<br>For true lovers of sport on TV there were some upsides. The WA-Allies clash was a corker to watch, despite Glen Jakovich's injury. Especially pleasing was the form of wiry Eagle Paul Symmons and rangy Docker James Clement.<br>What either side would give for full forward Scott Cummings to become homesick.<br>The SA-Victoria game in Adelaide was also a thriller, with oodles of entertaining talent on display.<br>The bad after-taste of these two good matches of football has been the slanging and sniping from Victoria and South Australia over WA's commitment to interstate games.<br>The real issue of interstate footy has never been whether one State beats another - it is whether they beat Victoria.<br>Trying to cajole the public into believing that WA-Allies is important - no matter how good the football produced - is futile.<br>All many care about is seeing the Big-V humbled. South Australians love it, too, and are doing some hysterical crowing right now about limiting interstate games to just SA-Victoria at Football Park.<br>A better scenario for football fans would be for WA, South Australia and The Allies all to have a crack at Victoria once a year at Subiaco, Football Park, the SCG, Gabba and/or North Hobart respectively.<br>Big crowds - at the grounds and on TV - would relish the chance to see each State (or combination) try to knock Victoria off its perceived pedestal.<br>The Vics would have to front up three times over the season, but if they're as committed as they say, what have they to lose?<br>???<br>THE foul weather that passes for an English summer robbed viewers of the chance to see much cricket from Lord's in the second Test. What we did see made the mouth water.<br>Glenn McGrath's 8-38 and the return of England's sloppy fielding may be the two key turning points in the Ashes series. The all-too-familiar site of Mark Taylor playing on for one run was the dark cloud.<br>Geoffrey ?lane and lenth? Boycott made an interesting expert commentator. He took over for much of the time, going on and on about every aspect of the game in fine detail.<br>He knows his cricket does our Boyks, but he can be maddeningly pedantic.<br>One minute he was praising Greg Blewett for his beautiful strokeplay, the next, after he couldn't resist a Robert Croft floater and was caught, he was admonishing the South Australian for playing at too many balls.<br>And he had the hide to say he ?felt for the cricketing public? because of the rain.<br>Boycott never batted like he felt for the cricketing public. That is a one-eyed Australian view of course.<br></font></p>
