            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WOULD be a perfect time to invade the US. No one is running the self-proclaimed greatest democracy on Earth right now.<br>Anyone vaguely in charge of anything is too busy talking about doctors and nurses games allegedly being played by their boss, Wee Willy Clinton. Kathleen Willey is the latest in an ever-increasing line of women to claim that Mr Clinton tried, as they say in high school, to go downstairs, outside.<br>Have you noticed something about these all-American girls who say they've had a bit too much of the President? They look just like Hillary Clinton.<br>They have high brows, lots of hair, intelligent eyes and are neither too fat nor too skinny.<br>Maybe Mr Clinton really has eyes only for his wife but is short-sighted and ends up making romantic suggestions to the wrong girl all the time.<br>His popularity is not suffering. A friend in Washington - a GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) if you must know - says most women believe Mr Clinton is guilty but don't care. Most men believe he is innocent and don't care, and/or envy him his reputation.<br>Indeed, some women believe it would be an honour to detect a wandering presidential hand. My advice to them: be patient.<br>It is a bit like the joke that did the rounds after the Monica Lewinsky allegations were first aired two months ago.<br>A poll asked US women if they would sleep with Mr Clinton given the allegations of his philanderings. Ninety per cent responded: not any more.<br>But seriously, with all attention focused on Mr Clinton's smoking trousers, who is looking after the country? Doesn't the US have poverty, crime, rampant drug abuse, white-collar dodginess, educational inequalities and unaffordable health care issues to be looked after?<br>The US seems to be reaping the whirlwind of over-education among its privileged ranks and the consequent double dose of political correctness. Either that or it is a nation of wowsers, obsessed with everyone else's sex life.<br>It is time the people had a good hard look at themselves and found something more important to talk about. The answer might just be staring them in the face if they care to poke about their backyards.<br>Why don't they knock on the door of inventor Alex Chiu? He has found the secret to eternal life, he says, and that would seem far more riveting than a few presidential indiscretions.<br>Mr Chiu is telling the world via his Internet site - www.alexchiu.com - that we can live forever by using his miraculous inventions, Eternal Life Rings ($18) and Eternal Life Foot Braces ($150).<br>They are magnetic devices worn during sleep. The finger-rings look like wheel nuts. The foot braces look like harmonicas. Both enhance the electric current and blood circulation of the body, says Mr Chiu. This improves metabolism and fights the ageing process.<br>If this sounds a little bizarre, Mr Chiu has evidence his inventions work. He has testimonials from happy purchasers who definitely are not dead yet.<br>What better proof could you get? One thing that remains unclear is whether the eternal livers have bought the finger or foot devices. The price difference suggests a better quality of eternal life if you buy the foot braces.<br>Mr Chiu offers a 90-day, money-back guarantee if dissatisfied. So, if after three months you are still not sure you will live forever, you can take a gamble and get back your hard-earned money.<br>Sounds like a bargain.<br>NOT signs of eternal life but signs nonetheless:<br>In a non-smoking area: ?If we see you smoking we will assume you are on fire and take appropriate action.?<br>On a maternity room door: ?Push, Push, Push.?<br>At an optometrist: ?If you don't see what you're looking for, you've come to the right place.?<br></font></p>
