            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Fair Game (M)<br>Cindy Crawford, William Baldwin<br>Steven Berkoff<br>Directed by Andrew Sipes<br>IT IS terribly unfair that supermodel Cindy Crawford's acting debut is in a film called Fair Game. Crawford is fair game for the critics. She can't act. Brutal, maybe, but simple enough.<br>No one expected her to be Meryl Streep or Helen Mirren and the gorgeous one has been quoted as saying it's as well this is an action movie where she doesn't have to try too hard to pretend that she is little more than window dressing.<br>But Crawford is simply just a supermodel. Wonderful to look at in still life or freeze-frame, wooden and unnatural when she has to, um, like, er, speak, or move.<br>It is as though director Andrew Sipes has told her ?look pained, Cindy?, or ?look tense?, or ?look aggressive?; and the good supermodel goes to great pains to assist but she just can't emote.<br>And her dialogue is almost painful, delivered with what she must think is conviction but is always reminiscent of a seventh-grader trying really, really hard to get her lines right for the school play.<br>She isn't alone in this mindless piece of babes and dudes sub-sub-Bond action movie.<br>William Baldwin as, yawn, tough but handsome and sensitive Miami cop Max Kirkpatrick protecting Crawford's civil lawyer Kate McQueen from a gang of ruthless, brilliant Russian-Cuban thugs, is tiresomely one-paced and predictable.<br>Steven Berkoff, a perennial baddie in Clockwork Orange, Beverly Hills Cop and Octopussy, is way over the top as lead villain Kazak, a money launderer who intends to manipulate computers to steal all the funds he's cunningly hidden for other crooks in foreign numbered bank accounts.<br>Even worse are his cohorts, particularly the continually frowning woman offsider who gets her kicks slaying people and the Russian computer expert who surely is sitting on the greatest technological marvel in history with a laptop computer that hacks into everything in sight from the dashboard of a constantly speeding four-wheel-drive.<br>Partly to blame for this bad over-acting is the tired, cliche- ridden, tough-guy script of Charlie Fletcher.<br>He has given us an implausible plot, unbelievable characters and the type of dialogue that, if it really represents the way American lawyers and other professionals speak, well, God save America.<br>The script, based on what would appear to be a pretty awful novel by Paula Gosling, is full of lines such as: ?I'll tell you this, Kate, whoever's after you, they're real pros.?<br>Having said all that, there are probably worse ways to kill an hour or so.<br>Appalling as it sounds, Fair Game is not bad on mindless mayhem, spectacular car chases and computer wizardry. If we still had matinees, it would be the ideal brainless B-grade hokum lead-up to something better.<br>The plot, totally unbelievable, revolves around Kazak's desire to keep his robber ship out of the hands of a settlement-seeking separated wife. McQueen, as her lawyer, is in the way and for some unfathomable reason, Kazak deploys dozens of goons with a seriously heavy arsenal in souped- up 4WDs to get Crawford.<br>Kirkpatrick gets involved and has to protect McQueen. Their growing relationship, hate to lust, is a central theme.<br>Baldwin and Crawford are no Bogie and Bacall. Let's face it, they're not even Homer and Madge.<br>Fletcher's script manages to enforce the brainless B-grade preoccupation that love cannot come without a lot of violence and profane one-liners.<br></font></p>
