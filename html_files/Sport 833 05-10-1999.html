            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE were two small problems for Perth viewers with the ABC's coverage of the Westar Rules grand final on Saturday.<br>The first was that there was not enough of it. The fantastic last quarter in which West Perth held on to kick clear of South Fremantle left the impression that what went before it must have been pulsating stuff.<br>And it signalled the end of six months of football on the small screen.<br>Now, I know there is still a lot of football to talk about.<br>Umpteen clubs are involved in getting Leigh Colbert from Geelong to the Kangaroos so he can live out his dream of playing in the finals.<br>And the Dockers appear to be haemorrhaging talent with the likely loss of Stephen O'Reilly, Clive Waterhouse, Craig Callaghan and Luke Toia.<br>Real diehards can get an even quicker fix this Friday night on Channel 7 with the first international rules match between Australia and Ireland.<br>But none of this is the real thing, is it?<br>Looking elsewhere, many of us have had to rely on Foxtel or VCRs to check out the following:<br>?Australia's thrashing of Romania in the rugby union World Cup.<br>?The Australian netballers' last-gasp victory against New Zealand in the world championship (a very ?skullful? contest according to one Kiwi commentator.).<br>?Ricky Ponting's terrific ton against Sri Lanka ... and the buckets of rain in Colombo.<br>? Vita Man's thrilling Metropolitan victory yesterday, and Allez Suez's Epsom on Saturday.<br>?Any amount of motor racing and motorcycle madness.<br>?Perth Glory's opening win in the National Soccer League - no, cancel that, no one saw it.<br>As good as all that was, it still seems too soon to let football go.<br>It really is the most difficult time in an armchair critic's life; those weeks between Bruce McAvaney's last cry of ?special? and Richie Benaud's first utterance of ?got him?.<br>So many things have been left unsaid. For example, during the 1999 football season we never heard: ?That free kick was so obvious I won't even comment on it.? - John Russo.<br>?Nothing to get excited about here. Wayne Carey's only kicked nine and Matthew Richardson eight.? - McAvaney.<br>?Clive Waterhouse is so dull. I'd rather watch paint dry.? - Dennis Cometti.<br>?And the gates have been locked here at Rushton Park. It's another sellout for the Peel Thunder.? - Wally Foreman.<br>?Collingwood aren't worth talking about this week.? - Eddie McGuire.<br>?This will be the match of the round Ed; Fremantle and Port Adelaide are my favourite sides.? - Sam Newman.<br>Ah well, there's always next year.<br>David Watts: watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
