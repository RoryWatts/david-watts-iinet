            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU don't need a modem or an Internet account to use two of the most important tools for the World Wide Web.<br>The graphics viewer ACDSee and graphics manipulation package Paint Shop Pro are regarded by Web surfers as essential as a Netscape browser, Agent newsreader and Eudora e-mail package.<br>ACDSee allows a user to delve deep into his or her cache after sessions on the Web, and Paint Shop Pro allows manipulation of what is found in that cache into, possibly, works of art.<br>ACDSee is a rapid viewer that can display nearly all graphics formats in fractions of a second. A 500kb bitmap may take as little as 1.5 seconds to display fully.<br>Its value in Web surfing is in exploring the user's Netscape or Explorer cache - the directories where Web browsers store text and images from surfing sessions.<br>ACDSee lists all the graphics files in the cache. A user only has to click on a file to have it displayed.<br>From there they can convert an image to wallpaper, delete or move the file to another directory. There is no fancy stuff, just rapid viewing. The use of ACDSee is a far better way of saving images than from a browser during a Net session.<br>Once moved, an image can be manipulated in a variety of ways by Paint Shop Pro - a heavyweight bit of shareware that allows cropping, resizing, recolouring, highlighting, text input, format conversion and more.<br>Its particular value is as a tool in HTML coding of Web pages. Good images for backgrounds, illustrations or button bars can be found through ACDSee, then reshaped for HTML use by Paint Shop Pro.<br></font></p>
