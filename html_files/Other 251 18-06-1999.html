            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SORRY but I am in a bit of a rush. I have to pack my bags and catch a flight to Heathrow. Must make it to Windsor on time for Prince Edward's wedding to that nice Sophie Rhys-Jones.<br>I don't have an actual invitation but I did write to the prince. I am taking his lack of reply as, no news being good news. Judge for yourselves whether I have earned a guernsey at the last royal bash of the millennium. Here is my letter to Edward:<br>Dear Ted (you don't mind if I call you that. I'm Australian and we don't go in much for calling people by titles such as Grand Poobah; unless it's someone like Steve Waugh, and then we'll genuflect and say things like Bloody Legend).<br>I'm trying to wrangle an invite to your and Sophie's wedding. This may sound a bit cheeky but I read recently about a 45-year-old unemployed English actor who did the same thing - and you sent him a ticket.<br>Now I know I'm not unemployed (though after this I might be) and I'm not an actor nor a Pom but I reckon I've got a bit to offer as a guest.<br>Your wedding sounds like it needs some brightening up and that's what we colonials are best at. You've decided to make it low-key with only 600 guests, about 8000 in the castle grounds and no media but the dear old BBC inside.<br>I just know you would rather let your hair down, if you had any to spare, of course. After all, weren't you the rogue who gave the world It's a Royal Knockout on TV, then flounced off when some arty-farty Pom journo critics panned it?<br>You've obviously got spirit. And I dare say Sophie has, too. That surname is very familiar to us over here. Surely she is the long-lost sister of that Carlton thug David Rhys-Jones. Boy, did he get some time off from footy for whacking blokes.<br>Just watch yourself when she's in a temper, Ted.<br>I also know that you and all your subjects - how many are yours as seventh in line by the way? - are in need of some lightening up.<br>Your cricketers were bundled out of the World Cup before the theme song was written, your rugby captain may be a drug fiend, your soccer team can only draw with some impoverished mob from eastern Europe and your Wimbledon hopes rest with that plucky lad Tim Henman and a Canadian.<br>An Aussie guest would bring in some rays of confidence and bonhomie. I'm also worried about your choice of music, Ted. According to my program of events, the Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines is going to be doing some oom-pah-pahhing around Windsor.<br>I can bring my ghetto blaster and some Jimmy Barnes, INXS and Midnight Oil CDs.<br>I do like your menu, though. There will be no need to provide anything for me on arrival. I'll have a dingo's breakfast - a glass of water, a wee (we now call it a Dee) and a good look round - before I catch a cab from Heathrow.<br>That should keep me going until the hot and cold canapes at 5pm. And I'm sure the buffet - how low-key - of beef stroganoff and fresh raspberries will last me until Sunday night.<br>You might ask why I just don't sit at home and watch your nuptials on TV, Ted. I thought about it but it looked a bit scary, too many harbingers of doom if you know what I mean.<br>Your do is on the ABC at 1.30am on Sunday. It follows Birds of a Feather, The Importance of Being Earnest, and is followed by Rage.<br>By the way you'll be able to recognise me among the guests . . . I have a bald spot and big ears.<br></font></p>
