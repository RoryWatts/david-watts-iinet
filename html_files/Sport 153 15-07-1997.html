            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT on TV is not for the birds . . . unless they are the Orioles, Kestrels, Ravens or other species in the National Netball League aviary.<br>Netball is fast, skilful and commands the highest registered participation rate of any sport in the country.<br>Its best practitioners provide frenetic matches in the national league on the ABC on Fridays and Saturdays.<br>It is good to watch and even the ?blokiest? viewer will recognise cut-down similarities to football in the leading, passing and woman-on-woman defence.<br>It is the only woman's sport that gets any major coverage at this footy-obsessed time of the year.<br>In May, the Australian Sports Commission's Women's Sport in Australia report found that women's sport scored only 0.2 per cent of commercial TV sport time.<br>The ABC - blessed or cursed with covering many marginal sports, and in Perth that includes Super League - gives women 20 per cent of sport air time.<br>What we are left with is a predominantly male agenda where women tend to make it to screen on the basis of figure-hugging lycra (as in basketball), bikinis (athletics, triathlon, beach volleyball) and knickers (tennis and hockey).<br>Sensation and scandal help as much as sex in bringing sports- women to TV - for example, the clubbing of US ice-skater Nancy Kerrigan and the drug-taking by tennis player Jennifer Capriati.<br>But overall, women's sport is a wasteland, trivialised if not totally overlooked.<br>One big reason for this appears to be that although women play sport in big numbers, they do not watch it in the same proportion. In particular, they do not watch women's sport.<br>The Australian Women's Yearbook 1997 found live sport attracted 52 per cent adult male audiences compared with 37 per cent adult women.<br>This is a big disparity considering that women outnumber men by more than 100,000 in Australia.<br>Of women who do go to sporting events, the report said the biggest number - 16 per cent - chose horse, harness or dog racing.<br>The next biggest event was footy, attended by 10 per cent, with rugby league well back but ahead of cricket, tennis and basketball.<br>On those figures it appears women love animals, then they like to see blokes in mortal combat - which is not all that different from what blokes themselves like watching.<br>Whichever way you look at it, it boils down to the AFL being king of the airwaves.<br>This is no surprise given the evenness of the competition and the consequent reliance on the gladiatorial traits of defence and fitness.<br>After 15 rounds would anyone dare to nominate the grand finalists with certainty, let alone next week's winners?<br>Will one be Geelong, such determined and pacy winners over North?<br>Will they meet Collingwood, whose 100-point drubbing of Fremantle was an exquisite display of speed and power?<br></font></p>
