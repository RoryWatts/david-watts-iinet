            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">KERRY STOKES should buy Perth Glory. Couch potatoes might then have something to look forward to at weekends.<br>The present set-up is a bit of a raffle. The ABC, bless "em, shows an Ericsson Cup soccer match of the day on Sunday evenings.<br>Happily, we in WA got to see the Glory defeat Northern Spirit two weeks ago.<br>But the national broadcaster is trying to satisfy the whole country and Glory games will be few and far between.<br>It is the same deal for the National Basketball League. You may see the Wildcats, but then you are just as likely to happen on a Townsville v Canberra contest.<br>All perfectly fine for the purist with national competitions being treated even-handedly.<br>But it is a bit tame for the average one-sided sports fan.<br>The Glory is on a roll and drawing the spectators to Perth Oval like no other team in the national league.<br>It is not only an ideal local team for soccer lovers to pour their passion into; but also a perfect bandwagon of emotion, action and pulled hamstrings to jump on while the AFL is in hibernation.<br>Stokes, the chairman of Channel 7, has TVW covering Wildcats home games in the NBL, which - even given the team's sluggish start to the season - is a boon for supporters.<br>Imagine if he, or indeed any of the commercial station owners, could get a slice of the Glory.<br>The Glory is an exciting prospect as entertainment value alone. Though it is unlikely to be repeated for years, Troy Halpin's 50m goal against Sydney United on Sunday has to rival anything that Scott Cummings, Tony Modra and Co can come up with as a pure sporting spectacle.<br>Stokes' Seven did have the chance to add soccer to its impressive collection of tele-sports.<br>In August, the network confirmed a 10-year, $25 million deal with Soccer Australia that gives Seven the rights to all international matches as well as the Ericsson Cup.<br>Seven then handed live coverage of the cup to the ABC for the next four years and also to pay-TV operator Optus.<br>So we are left with the wider, less parochial - and certainly less exciting or passionate - view of the game.<br>The Glory's 3-1 win over United in front of nearly 17,000 fans would have been the perfect antidote to Seven's delayed telecast of the AFL draft on Sunday.<br>You had to be a diehard to find it thrilling. The draft is a complicated and elaborate piece of sporting drama, but better read about than watched.<br>Sandy Roberts and his panel tried to inject appropriate excitement with mini-biographies of each hopeful as grim-faced club executives called his name.<br>But after the top 10, it was always going to be hard to keep the superlatives going.<br>And the serious nature of the event meant that all commentary had to be done Pot Black-style - in a respectful whisper.<br>And whispering is not Roberts' strong suit.<br></font></p>
