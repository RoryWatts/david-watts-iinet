            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPARE a thought for John Worsfold this Sunday.<br>The former West Coast skipper might have been big and mean enough to handle physical clashes on the field during his career.<br>But on Sunday the rookie commentator will have to endure Bruce McAvaney at the SCG while Sydney's Tony Lockett strives to break the AFL goal-kicking record. Just to make the match tougher for Worsfold, injured Swan Dale Lewis is likely to be there with McAvaney. And Richard Osborne, who played 16 games for Sydney in 1993, will be roving the boundary line.<br>Neutralising McAvaney with sound, objective comments will be tough for Worsfold. The enthusiastic talking head left many Fremantle fans fuming two rounds ago with his constant championing of Lockett in the full forward's comeback game.<br>McAvaney's shouts of ?Plugger, Plugger, oh Pluuuuuggga? even led one supporter to write a letter to the editor of The West Australian, complaining about this sycophancy.<br>The fact that Docker Tony Modra kicked six to Lockett's five did not dampen McAvaney's ardour one bit.<br>McAvaney's love of sport is a two-edged sword. It works best when he is hosting a show such as Sportsworld where he can demonstrate his considerable knowledge of all sport and bounce ideas off expert guests such as rugby league's Roy Masters.<br>It is at its worst when McAvaney has to call a contest involving one of his favourites.<br>And his favourites are undoubtedly the big names. If, like Lockett, they are on the verge of an historic event, one can bet McAvaney will be shouting long and hard for the ball to be at his end.<br>McAvaney's barracking aside, the chance to see West Coast go farther ahead on the ladder, or see whether Lockett can kick six on Ashley McIntosh, is going to make the armchair the place to be on Sunday.<br>The AFL has scheduled a later starting time of 1.20pm so Seven can beam Lockett's record bid to Melbourne viewers, who originally were going to see only Brisbane v Geelong from the Gabba.<br>A Perth audience of more than 300,000 is expected. A message at West Coast's Internet site yesterday predicted 400,000 viewers.<br>The average audience for a Sunday afternoon Eagles game is 300,000, but, as McAvaney himself would say, this one is special, and therefore bound to draw more people.<br>The West Coast-Sydney game will follow the match from Brisbane. After all this football, the ABC will have the perfect complement - even more football, but of the soccer variety.<br>For the thousands who bit their fingernails down to the elbows during Saturday night's Perth Glory-Marconi thriller, Sunday brings the chance to do it all again as the Glory tackle Sydney United for a grand final spot.<br>Those seeking gentler sporting pursuits will not find them even though Channel 9 will be showing live coverage of the cricket World Cup from 5.30pm.<br>It will be Australia v Pakistan ... and those blokes are as uncompromising as Woosha.<br></font></p>
