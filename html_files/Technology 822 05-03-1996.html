            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE is a site on the World Wide Web so gruesome and horrific that it should be brought to the attention of the US Government immediately so it can exercise its tough, new Internet censorship Act.<br>From the land that turned divorce into a leading recreational pursuit and where a lawyer lurks inside every ambulance comes a site so covered in sugar and rice it could be eaten - but not digested.<br>The Way Cool Wedding site appears to be America's latest attempt at isolation from the real world.<br>Weddings are great for the participants and immediate families. They even seem to like looking at the endless photos.<br>But now, thanks to Way Cool Wedding, everyone on the Net who chances on the site can look at albums - not only of the wedding, but also of the honeymoon, before the wedding, the house, the loving couple at home and just about anything else.<br>To qualify for a listing on Way Cool Wedding all the average Net user has to do is get married, provide about a megabyte of appropriate pictures and write gushy poems and stories about their spouses - or spice.<br>Every Monday the coordinators of the site, Kim and Carl White (whose wedding is featured), choose a nuptial celebration as the wedding of the week, allowing the loving couple to spread themselves over several Internet pages with messages like: ?This page was created on our two-month anniversary. We think we're starting to give people the impression we're newlyweds.?<br>And it is not only Americans who are featured. Sabine and Lars from Germany, who featured in the January lists, had texts of their service in English and German.<br>Other couples had multimedia invitations or rich HTML, graphic-enhanced Net wedding albums.<br>URL: http://tribeca.ios.com/~whitey/waycool?<br></font></p>
