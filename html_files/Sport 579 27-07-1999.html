            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MEMO to self - get a life.<br>It has just dawned on me that since the end of March I have been following an unchanged ritual every Saturday afternoon.<br>It goes like this: At midday, turn TV to Channel 7 and watch AFL match of the day. At the same time, connect to the Internet, open both the official AFL site and the Melbourne Age Footy 99 one and watch the progress of any other AFL matches.<br>It means constantly turning from screen to screen, but has the attraction of not having to listen to Rex Hunt on the radio, as well as keeping me up to date with my ghastly footy tipping record.<br>I used to think it was a wired way to be, and it used to be enjoyable. But now I wonder - is following live sport on the Net all it's cracked up to be?<br>A couple of weeks ago I followed the first three quarters of the Richmond-Eagles game from the MCG on the Net before turning on the delayed telecast on TV.<br>On the Net, the game looked tense and close. But then again Netcasts rely on simple text commentary such as: ?Richardson kicks from a tight angle. Only a behind. Two points in it.?<br>What the Seven telecast showed was Richmond pulling away while the Eagles wilted.<br>Two weekends ago, football followers outside WA were not able to see the Dockers' historic first win over the Eagles. This was possibly a good thing for West Coast fans, but diehards like to watch, no matter what.<br>An Eagles fan based in Melbourne spoke of his frustration: ?Have you ever been through the experience of "watching' an Eagles game on the little scoreboard on your PC? It is a very plastic, synthetic way of "watching' your footy team. You watch for ages and nothing happens. Suddenly, the screen refreshes and the Eagles register a goal. Then, with the Dockers rampaging (though this is impossible to know, at the time), the Dockers kick on and keep or increase their margin.?<br>The superiority of TV over the Net for live football was further emphasised last week by Seven's decision to show last Sunday's Brisbane-Eagles clash live into Melbourne instead of Adelaide-Hawthorn.<br>Never mind that the Brisbane-Eagles game had more riding on it and that Adelaide-Hawthorn was between the 11th and 14th-placed sides, both struggling.<br>In Melbourne they want Melbourne teams. The non-telecast outraged Hawks supporters.<br>The AFL tried to ease their plight by offering an audio broadcast at its Web site.<br>The silence in terms of thank-yous was deafening. The Net might be the greatest thing since Cazaly but voices on a computer cannot and will never compete with live television, even if it has Sandy Roberts, Bruce McAvaney or Doug Hawkins warbling away.<br>All the studies are showing that TV viewing is dropping in homes with Net access, but I would not bother trying to tell that to football fanatics dying to see their team in action.<br></font></p>
