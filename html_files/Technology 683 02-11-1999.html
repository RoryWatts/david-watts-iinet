            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet economy in the US was described last week as an economic phenomenon never seen before.<br>A report for Cisco Systems by the University of Texas found that:<br>?The Net economy grew 68 per cent from the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of 1999.<br>?It accounted for 2.3 million jobs.<br>?One in three of the 3400 companies surveyed for this report did not exist before 1996 and had been established purely because of the Net.<br>?The monthly addition of 2000 new secure sites on the World Wide Web reflected the creation of new companies and shifting of existing businesses to the Net.<br>The University of Texas report - available in full on the Web at the Internet Economy Indicators site - forecasts the Net economy will grow to $780 billion this year compared with the $460 billion generated in revenue in 1998. The university described this growth as astounding.<br>And the report's findings reflected a growing awareness among companies of the impact of the Net on their business and the number of workers participating in Net-related jobs.<br>?Everyone from the Federal Reserve Chairman (Alan Greenspan) to world leaders to chief executives is grappling to grasp the Net economy's direction and impact,? the report said.<br>Within hours of the report's release on Thursday, Dr Greenspan was telling a business council meeting in Florida that the Net had been a major accelerator of productivity and increased standards of living.<br>But he warned: ?The rate of growth of productivity cannot continue to increase indefinitely. At some point it must, at least, plateau. Should, at that point, labour market tightness result in faster growth of nominal wage rates, there would be no offset from accelerating productivity. As a consequence, unit costs would likely rise, pressuring profit margins and prices.?<br>The University of Texas report also attempted to present a wider view of the Net economy's impact on the general economy and society as a whole.<br>The report's authors said in a section called the Big Picture that Net technologies and applications had grown more rapidly than anyone could have envisioned five years ago.<br>New frontiers of communication, collaboration and coordination between consumers, businesses and trading partners had opened.<br>?What started out as static personal Web pages with photographs to be shared with friends and family or hastily compiled company brochure-ware has quickly culminated into a myriad of highly sophisticated hardware and software applications that are enabling forward thinking companies to leverage the massive and ubiquitous public technology infrastructure of the Internet to create new value for their stakeholders,? the report said.<br>The impact of e-commerce was likened to the industrial revolution of last century.<br>The report noted the Net economy was markedly different to the general economy in three key areas - information, knowledge and speed.<br>And it predicted that big parts of Net economic growth would be made at the expense of parts of the physical economy, particularly where online commerce took over traditional shopping roles.<br>In other developments, more than a quarter of the population of the UK is online, according to Nielsen Media Research.<br>The survey, released last week, showed that 46 million people, or 27 per cent of the population, had used the Net in the past month.<br>But the report also found that 1.6 million people had still not heard of the medium.<br>The UK figure of 27 per cent compares with an estimated 30.5 per cent in Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<br>HELP DESK<br>University of Texas report:<br>www.internetindicators.com/index.html<br>Greenspan speech:<br>www.bog.frb.fed.us/Boarddocs/Speeches/1999/199910282.htm Media: www.nielsenmedia.com/index.html<br></font></p>
