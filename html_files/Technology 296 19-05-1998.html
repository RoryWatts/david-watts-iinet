            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">www.cygnus.uwa.edu.au/<br>~gmalcolm/ita/<br>Grant Malcolm of the Independent Theatre Association says his group was not content to simply reproduce its newsletters when it launched its Web site in March. ?Instead it strived to create an interactive environment that encourages the on-line theatre community to contribute,? Mr Malcolm told Access. And that is what has been achieved. The ITA's site has message boards where people can post notices to each other, a live chat room, theatre news and events and a comprehensive links page that allows users to add their own theatre links. To save theatre-goers wading through hundreds of pages, the ITA maintains a searchable on-line database of what is playing in community theatres, audition notices, scripts for loan and club contact details. (DW)<br>The E Ring<br>www.geocities.com/Hollywood/<br>Studio/8415<br>The E in the title of Lynton Moore's site stands for entertainment, which in this case means any site that deals with jokes, TV and movies, celebrities, music, gossip, sport, Hollywood, chat, trivia, art and sculpture . . . phew. Mr Moore describes his site as a Web ring for entertainment sites around the world. ?You can come and add your site to my Web ring or just browse through all the sites that are a part of it or apply for the E Award for entertainment home pages,? he says. Last week the E Ring pointed to 169 different sites. (DW)<br>The Wit and Wisdom of Imelda Marcos<br>users.lanminds.com/<br>~tamad/splash.htm<br>The former first lady of the Philippines said a lot in her time and someone has thoughtfully compiled a list of the best - and worst - of Imelda. This site lists many of her remarks made to various publications before, during and after her political demise. Her comments are divided into various categories, including comments on money, her country, being first lady, beauty and her own philosophy. Many of the comments could easily slip into any and all of the categories and it's difficult to know whether she knows the distinction between wit and wisdom. ?I am like a wandering Jew, looking for my Israel,? the poor, tormented soul commented on being in exile in Hawaii. And just in case you wondered: ?I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty.? It's good for a laugh. (SS)<br>Hotgames<br>www.hotgames.com<br>If you're looking for details on new PC games and a few that are past their use-by dates, Hotgames has more than 500 on its list. Each includes a review and demo download with system requirement information and approximate download times. The reviews are generally informative although some, obviously contributed by gamers, are a little dubious. Games are listed alphabetically, by genre and by publisher with links to the publishers' sites. You can also subscribe to the Hotgames newsletter, delivered to your e-mail inbox twice a week with latest updates and other gaming information. (SS)<br>Godzilla vs Tamagotchi<br>www.jitterbug.com/gvt/gvt.shtml<br>It is very hard not to become addicted to this rather silly and simple little game, made possible by the Shockwave plug-in. The aim is to squash an annoying little Tamagotchi under the huge, hairy feet of Godzilla. If you succeed, the luckless little Tamagotchi squeals: ?Ooh, I don't like this game.? It looks deceptively easy, but be warned that low scorers are instructed to commit ritual suicide. Alternatively they can follow the links to related on-line fun including Traumagotcha (bombs and baseball bats as weapons of choice) and more healthily, the Happy House Virtual Hamster. (DW)<br>Viagra<br>www.viagra.com<br>Viagra is the drug of the moment in the US. Its aim is to cure impotency in older men, but it is attracting a great deal of attention from perfectly potent chaps who want to be supermen in bed. This official site tells you everything you ever wanted to know about Viagra . . . and a lot you probably never wanted to know as well. Take the introduction, for example: ?Viagra . . . is the citrate salt of sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5).? There's much more, but it does give full details of research and results that promise a brave - and possibly bold - new world for its users.
