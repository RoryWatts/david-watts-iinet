            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DENNIS COMETTI was nearly centimetre perfect.<br>As the Kangaroos stuck the knife further into West Coast yesterday, the velvet-voiced one said that West Australians who had taken a dodgy sickie to watch the match on TV would need a genuine sickie after seeing the team's poor effort.<br>At three-quarter time that looked a good call. But the last 15 minutes - probably when the Roos had taken their foot off the pedal - was decent medicine for Eagles supporters who had been feeling ill because of their team's showing ... or just ill-tempered because of another baffling day of umpiring.<br>Armchair critics had the following to smile about, or at least feel less grumpy about:<br>? Chris Mainwaring's comeback, with improved disposal skills.<br>?The good form and work ethic of youngsters Rowan Jones, Andrew Williams and Andrew Embley.<br>?The knowledge that the badly needed ruck duo of Michael Gardiner and Jason Ball would be back.<br>?The imminent return of both Peter Matera and Fraser Gehrig.<br>?The fact that West Coast's next five games are against teams outside the top eight.<br>Not a bad piece of optimism to be going on with. And it certainly fits the upbeat sporting mood created by Fremantle's classy win against Adelaide and Australia's gutsy defeat of South Africa in the cricket World Cup.<br>Although the Kangaroos dominated, particularly in defence where Mick Martyn looked uglier and bigger than ever, it was curious that much of the commentary centred on the Eagles.<br>Cometti, Bruce McAvaney and Doug Hawkins took good, hard looks at most of the West Coast line-up and seemed to like what they saw, despite the ease with which the side was beaten.<br>Curious maybe, but then again we were:<br>?Watching football on a working Monday here.<br>?From the Sydney home ground of a Melbourne team.<br>?A match attended by 15,000 mostly novice AFL devotees.<br>?In a city which barely knows the difference between referee and umpire or boundary and touch.<br>?And a city whose main newspaper appeared to devote only one small preview to the match of the round. That preview claimed Mainwaring would play his second match of the year.<br>The AFL certainly has the job in front of it to convince Sydneysiders that there is more to football than the Swans and Tony Lockett.<br>Their big selling point for yesterday's clash, Wayne Carey, had little impact and even McAvaney refrained from using the words ?clever? or ?special?.<br>In fact, he had no need for either word to describe the whole duel. It was top-of-the-table and a test of strength, but the wind, neutralising defences and skittish umpiring put it in the ho-hum viewing category.<br></font></p>
