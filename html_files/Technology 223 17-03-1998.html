            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE world's richest man and most recognisable ?nerd? will address Federal Cabinet in Melbourne today.<br>Microsoft chairman and chief executive Bill Gates is being afforded a privilege normally reserved for visiting heads of state.<br>Fresh from half a dozen legal wrangles - including a contempt of court threat that could cost $1 million a day in a suit relating to his company's Internet software - Mr Gates is being feted like royalty on his two-day visit to Australia.<br>Mr Gates has a lot to share. Not only is he recognised as a man of vision, he is also regarded as one of the most astute businessmen of this century.<br>Critics say that Microsoft's success has not been due to the cleverness of its software, which is sometimes viewed as average, but to the firm's ability to promote and market.<br>Microsoft dominates the most explosive industry in the world - personal computing - by selling the Windows software that controls nearly 90 per cent of systems.<br>And unless the courts rule otherwise, Microsoft is well on the way to dominating the market in software used to browse and interact with the World Wide Web of the Internet - potential customer base 80 million and growing - with its Internet Explorer program.<br>Mr Gates' company also has stakes in cable TV, which it sees as a perfect conduit for the Internet. And Mr Gates wants to put Windows CE, or palm-top, software in a startling array of home and business appliances that will allow the Internet to be received on digital television sets.<br>Mr Gates has a personal fortune estimated at upwards of $40 billion and it is estimated he earns $150 a second.<br>He says Australia is perfectly placed to be a key player in the global communications marketplace.<br>He also said yesterday that digital television was the next big step on the path to combining the television set and the computer, and described how the Federal Government might do more to become a model in the provision of electronic commerce.<br>But a report last week on NineMSN, a joint Internet venture between Microsoft and Kerry Packer's PBL, claimed Prime Minister John Howard's staff doubted whether their boss had surfed the Net yet.<br></font></p>
