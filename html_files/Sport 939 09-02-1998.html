            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TOP that in 2000, Sydney. If Olympic opening ceremonies were Olympic events - like diving, for example - Nagano would have scored respectable 7s and 7.5s for the effort seen on Channel 7 on Saturday morning.<br>It started off a little dull, but ended in the most breathtaking fashion with the seemingly impossible spectacle of five massed choirs on five continents synchronising perfectly with a choir and orchestra in Japan and the 50,000 spectators at the Manami Sports Park.<br>The mostly Japanese crowd broke the politeness and reserve that had marked much of the preceding two hours by singing along lustily.<br>Not bad considering the tune was Beethoven's monumental Ode to Joy and it was in German.<br>The nearly 20 minutes of elation had the double benefit of silencing Seven's company of motormouths, in particular Garry Wilkinson and Ann Sanders, who had been resorting to your typical Olympic opening spiels of spectacle, colour, goodwill and excitement.<br>Sanders, for one, will not want to dwell too much on the moment she described British landmine victim Chris Moon entering the stadium with the torch. ?Running with only one leg ... what a feat,? she said, or words very similar. It sounded much worse than it reads.<br>I wouldn't even begin to explain how the Japanese managed to synchronise the choirs in Sydney, Beijing, Berlin, New York and False Bay, near Cape Town, South Africa.<br>The main reason is I don't know. Normally, linking pictures and sounds over great distances can involve time lags of four seconds. At New Year a friend told me how he had overcome a one-second delay while producing a live simulcast rock show between Adelaide and Sydney.<br>And that gave me such a headache, I couldn't even begin to think how the Nagano spectacle came to life.<br>Suffice it to say it was a triumph of television and, if enough of our sun-loving population was drawn to the snowy spectacle, a good mustering point for Seven's assault on the Australia-wide ratings war.<br>If two weeks of figure skating, curling, brutal ice hockey and those lunatics on the luge can drag us away from sleepy one-dayers and little else, Bruce McAvaney's boys will be on a roll for the footy season.<br>Seven has had a fine start to the year. It began with the swimming here, the never-ending thump-thump and grovel to McEnroe of the Australian Open tennis and dragged in some fine golf.<br>Add to that the fact that Seven has lured Jason Dunstall and Doug Hawkins away from the Footy Show on Nine, and it just might be close to building the perfect footy station, complete with a proper humorous look at the game.<br>And you know footy is right back on the agenda. In Melbourne last Friday about 2000 - twice the Sheffield Shield crowd at the MCG - went to Waverley to watch Richmond thump North by 14 goals.<br></font></p>
