            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT COMES as no surprise that Windows 98 - which goes on sale on Thursday - is unsurprising.<br>Microsoft went into overdrive to hype Windows 95 in August 1995 with the famous Start Me Up pitch. It has not had to call on Mick Jagger and the marketing gurus to sell its latest operating system upgrade.<br>The US Department of Justice anti-trust law suit against Bill Gates' company has provided hype enough - albeit of a different kind - to ensure the Windows 98 brand is fixed firmly in consumers' minds.<br>And millions of Win 95 users who have the OSR2 release and Internet Explorer 4 have a pretty good idea what Windows 98 is like.<br>The bottom line is: is it worth paying $160 for?<br>The answer has to be a qualified yes. The West Australian has been using Win 98 betas and preview releases for six months on a pentium 133 with 32Mb of RAM and finds it fast and stable - a definite improvement on the basic Win 95 and less troublesome than Win 95 with IE 4.<br>In fact Win 98 has proved so relentlessly stable - only one crash worth noting - that it has provided neither relief from work nor a challenge to reconfigure.<br>So if that sort of stability would improve your computing experience, then Win 98 is a must.<br>And if you have Windows 3.x on a strong enough platform - pentium and at least 16Mb of RAM - then an upgrade to a far easier, attractive and more reliable OS must be considered.<br>Also, if you would like your PC to operate as if you were permanently browsing the Web, Win 98 is the way to go.<br>The Web browser interface of IE 4 is perhaps the most dramatic user interface difference between Win 95 and 98. You do not have to change the properties to enable the Web view of everything from your hard drive to folders to ... well, the Web, to use Win 98. But without this change, the interface offers very little that is new or different.<br>Some of the bells and whistles are questionable. The Active Desktop and Channels, in particular, appear to be more of a cluttering annoyance than any real benefit.<br>The Active Desktop is not mandatory. It is an option in properties and settings that allows the desktop to be a Web page of your choice, or a specially designed part of a Web Channel, like a search engine.<br>You can hide all your desktop icons and concentrate solely on the Web. Great if you have a permanent connection or that is your job, but of dubious benefit if, like the bulk of home users, you connect for an hour or so each day.<br>Channels follows the ruthless always-connected philosophy too. Channels are specially-prepared Web sites that can be subscribed to and their content can be delivered automatically to the desktop or hard drive.<br>They simply take the fun out of random surfing and often are intolerably slow to load. Even Mr Gates has been quoted as saying that he does not think more than one per cent of users will be beguiled by the so-called push technology that drives Channels.<br>On the positive side of the user interface are some handy additions to the Start menu, including an FAQ (frequently asked questions) and a Windows Update. The update allows a user to be connected to a Microsoft Web site which automatically interrogates the user's PC to find out what software is on board, then suggests updated or new programs that will install themselves on the PC if the user requests.<br>What goes on under Win 98's bonnet is probably the biggest overall improvement. Many users in newsgroups and at Win 98 Web sites (see Help Desk) have praised Microsoft for the work done on stability and speed. And with the next breath they have condemned the company for doing only what it should have with Win 95.<br>In short, Win 98 is really the Win 95 users needed in the first place - not the over-hyped package that caused so much complaint on the under-powered specifications recommended at the time.<br>Microsoft claims Win 98 is 36 per cent faster than 95. It is a hard claim to either rebuff or support because of the plethora of different platforms. But generally speaking it is perceptibly faster.<br>And, as stated before, it is far more stable and forgiving.<br>Microsoft has fixed more than 3000 bugs reported by Win 95 users and included all patches and updates as standard on this release.<br>System maintenance is easier. The Disk Cleanup Wizard, which automatically deletes unnecessary files, and the Maintenance Wizard, which holds your hand through the scheduling of basic disk maintenance, are excellent for novices. And power users may like the Task Scheduler and System Configuration utility.<br>Confident users who have a 2Gb hard disk or bigger can convert their file system to FAT-32 (basically more files in less space) to free up their drives. The down side is that once the disk is converted, you cannot uninstall Win 98 without a total re-format.<br>The Windows Magazine Upgrade Guide on the Web has an exhaustive guide to FAT-32 and installation that is highly recommended before popping the Win 98 CD into the drive.<br>It even shows users how to copy vital parts of the setup CD to their hard drive for faster installation.<br>On the hardware side, Win 98 claims the ultimate plug and play through its Universal Serial Bus feature (though users will need the latest connection on their PCs to use it). However, this was the selling point that embarrassed Mr Gates at a Win98 preview in Chicago last May, so it will have to be seen repeatedly to be believed.<br>Basically the USB allows new hardware devices to be plugged into a Win 98 machine while it is running, and for those devices - printers and, scanners - to be installed and configured automatically.<br></font></p>
