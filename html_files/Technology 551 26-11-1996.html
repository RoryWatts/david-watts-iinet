            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FRIEND remarked recently that the Internet had allowed people to let loose their innermost desires in a way never seen before.<br>He was not talking about the rapidly growing fountain of educational knowledge, but was referring to the ability of the World Wide Web to allow people to publish their longest-held passions ... trivia to be exact.<br>There is hardly a better example of this on the Web than The Bagpipes go to the Movies page.<br>The site is maintained by Canadians Scott Williams and Alistair Fraser, two men fiercely proud of their position in the world as the leading compilers of a list of films and TV shows that have featured bagpipes.<br>It is mind-boggling and the two men are not backward in saying what they think of people who poke fun at their site, as this excerpt from the introduction to their page illustrates.<br>?This page has been visited by a much wider group of people than those for whom it was intended: many have been directed to it by citations in Mirsky's Worst of the Web and by Useless Pages. While I am an advocate of open information, nevertheless, it is not obvious to me that one is obliged to welcome people into one's home when their purpose is to deride and insult. Consequently, access to this page is now patrolled by the BOZO FILTER, a JavaScript created to reject access from pages with unwelcome pointers.?<br>URL: http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/<br>PipesMovies.html<br>The Bagpipes go to the Movies<br></font></p>
