            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE stories I was hearing the other night cannot be repeated. If they were, and our libel laws being what they are, I would become pretty close to Alan Bond in the near future just for daring to utter them.<br>A group of us - couple of blokes and GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums) - were gossiping over beer, wine and pizza (Friday night health food). The stories about prominent people were incredible, but also believable. The fact was we had no way of telling if any of them was true.<br>This would appear to be a fairly common part of life: good stories, no facts. Cruel people say of journalists that we never let the facts get in the way of a good story. Those cruel people should talk. Good stories abound. But many are untrue.<br>The best of these sorts of stories are known as apocryphal yarns, sometimes as urban myths. They seem to be defined by having the ring of truth. And they are nearly always told by someone who knows someone who knows the person the incidents happened to.<br>When you are told the same story twice by totally different people, both swearing to their yarn's veracity, there is a good chance you are hearing an apocryphal yarn.<br>When that yarn comes back to you from different States or even countries, then you know you are in the presence of an urban myth.<br>The one trotted out the other night by one of our group is gaining currency. It concerns a Perth couple staying in New York.<br>They were on the last night of a pleasant holiday and decided to splash out by booking into a ritzy hotel where they would enjoy all the best five-star comforts as well as a good meal.<br>The husband went down to dinner because the wife was prettying herself up and took a little extra time to soak up the luxuries of their suite.<br>Finally she was ready, hopped in the lift and proceeded down.<br>After one floor, the lift stopped and in walked three black men. One, the smallest, looked vaguely familiar. The others were hulking brutes wearing leather gloves and wraparound sunglasses.<br>The door closed and one of the hulking brutes said: ?Hit the floor.?<br>The Perth woman's worst fears of New York started to emerge. She was going to be mugged, possibly raped and murdered.<br>She threw herself on the floor, by now she was crying. She held up her handbag and whimpered: ?Just take the money and leave me alone.?<br>Nothing happened. All the way to the ground floor, nothing happened as she lay trembling in fright.<br>The men walked out without a word, though the woman thought she heard a quiet chuckle. She composed herself as well as she could and joined her husband at the bar for a swift, strong drink and a tearful tale.<br>The couple became angry and protested to the management about their ruined evening. Next morning they went to check out and were told their bill had been paid in full.<br>The benefactor was none other than film star Eddie Murphy. He'd been the vaguely familiar one in the lift. The other two were his bodyguards and ?hit the floor? simply meant push the button for the first floor.<br>One of the blokes at our Friday night gossip said he had heard this same story from two people who didn't know each other. In both cases, the holidaying couple were different.<br>It certainly is a more publishable yarn than the one about the family of four holidaying in ... some say New York, others Paris and even others Bali.<br>I don't know if anyone's heard it but it concerns four toothbrushes, a camera, surprise holiday snapshots and a hotel employee doing unsavoury and unmentionable things.<br>Sometimes it is better when things aren't true.<br></font></p>
