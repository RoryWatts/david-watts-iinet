            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH Internet users have helped save the cult television program The Sentinel.<br>The science-fiction drama screens here on Channel 7 late on Thursdays. It has attracted a devoted audience, many of whom joined the global campaign to rescue it after its American makers announced in late May they were canning it.<br>Perth viewers were able to concentrate their pleas at the Support Our Sentinel Web site in the US.<br>The site was set up as fans began campaigning by more conventional means such as letters, faxes and phone calls to the United Paramount Network. Highlights of the campaign included a full-page advertisement in USA Today protesting against UPN's decision, and a mass e-mail write-in to a poll at the Ultimate TV Web site. The poll asked viewers to say which of four threatened programs should be saved.<br>The Sentinel was a close second to Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman, with more than 20,000 surfers voting for it.<br>UPN was staggered by the weight of protest. It took 13,000 phone calls from angry fans in the 48 hours after it announced the show's axing. During June several sponsors threatened to withdraw support for UPN productions as well.<br>Early this month the SOS site was able to tell Web users that UPN had buckled under pressure and ordered eight new episodes for the 1998-99 TV season.<br>UPN credited the fan campaign as a deciding factor. At the SOS Web site, UPN entertainment chief Tom Nunan is quoted as saying: ?The outpouring of fan support has been tremendous.?Aside from the legion of loyal Sentinel fans who have bombarded our office with tens of thousands of phone calls, I think the happiest person to hear the news is the UPN switchboard operator.?<br>Help Desk<br>Support Our Sentinel:<br>world.std.com/~sentinel/<br>Ultimate TV:<br>www.ultimatetv.com<br></font></p>
