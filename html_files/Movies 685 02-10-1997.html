            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE H H H H<br>The most swinging picture of the year has to be George of the Jungle, a hilarious live-action version of the popular late 60s cartoon about a Tarzan-like nature boy (Brendan Fraser) who lives in a split-level tree-house with an English-speaking, violin-playing intellectual gorilla (delightfully voiced by John Cleese) and has a pet elephant that thinks it's a dog. All these animals are a good deal smarter than George, who's a few bananas short of a bunch, and so is the wonderfully intrusive narrator. In wacky, post-modernist style, he keeps butting in, reminding the audience of movie conventions and making corrections when things get too far-fetched. Things go really ape when George joins the beautiful heiress Ursula Stanhope (Leslie Mann) and trades in his loincloth for Armani. Hip, delightfully self-referential and featuring a gorilla singing My Way in a Las Vegas show, George of the Jungle is wonderful, chest-beating fun. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE GAME H H H ½<br>Michael Douglas is such an intelligent actor and producer that anything he puts his name to can't be discounted easily. In films such as Wall Street, War of the Roses and Falling Down, Douglas probed the dark side of the American dream, dealing with the kind of risky material routinely passed over by his superstar contemporaries such as Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson. The Game is not vintage Douglas, merely a machine-tooled thriller, but he is perfectly cast as Nicholas Von Orton, the fabulously wealthy control-freak financier whose life is turned upside down by a dangerous game. Director David Fincher gives the film the same doom-laden, nightmarish quality that made his last film, the chilling Seven, such a hit. In the end, however, it's too mechanical and heartless to make us believe in Von Orton's final redemption. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>EXILE IN SARAJEVO H H H H<br>It has been only a couple of years since atrocities ceased in the Bosnian war, yet those images of bloodied corpses, grieving families and one of Europe's most beautiful cities crumbling under a hail of gunfire seem almost like ancient history. This is because the mainstream media have moved on to more pressing issues, like the death of a princess and crooked politicians. Determined not to repeat the mainstream media's shallow coverage, Tahir Cambis, a Melbourne actor of Bosnian descent, set out to show Sarajevo in all its complexity - to correct myths about ancient ethnic hatred and counter-balance images of war with a portrait of the city's thriving multicultural community. Cambis achieves this richness by placing himself at the centre of the story. In documenting his own ethical and moral problems with filming scenes of unimaginable horror, Cambis (together with his Bosnian co-director Alma Sahbaz) has created a documentary that is as intellectually challenging as it is deeply moving. See full review in page 5. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BUDDY H H H<br>Based on Animals Are My Hobby, the autobiography of eccentric New York socialite Gertrude ?Trudy? Lintz, Buddy is the story of one woman's passion for animals and her quest to raise a baby gorilla. At around 85 minutes there's not enough time to delve into much character development or background but Buddy certainly seemed to entrance the mainly under-10 audience at the preview I attended. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>FREE WILLY 3 H H<br>In his latest adventure, Willy and his new mate become the target for poachers who are supplying whale meat to countries where it is considered a delicacy. While the ethical issues raised by this third Free Willy adventure are of interest, Sam Pillsbury's direction is so earnest he allows for no humour and little suspense. Also, the film's climax is unintentionally unsettling, with the suggestion that the life of a whale is of more importance than the poacher father of one of the young heroes. Rated PG (Kevin Thomas - LA Times)<br>HERCULES H H H ½<br>The critics have joined forces with the Greek Government to fling sharp-tipped javelins at Hercules, but the real target audience, the kids, gave it a big thumbs-up at the preview. They seemed to care little that Disney's 35th animated feature veers wildly from the original myth and the muscle-bound mortal's 12 mountainous labours, enjoying instead the range of wise-cracking characters (beautifully voiced by James Woods, Danny DeVito, Bobcat Goldthwaith and Matt Frewer) that make this lively entertainment, not a slavish retelling of an epic. Rated G (David Watts)<br>MEN IN BLACK H H H H<br>The aliens patrolled by the men in black (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) are not the marauding big-headed monsters of Independence Day and Mars Attacks! but normal-looking, hard-working folk who are as respectful of the American Dream as the millions who've passed through New York's Ellis Island. They have their quirks - Sylvester Stallone, Madonna, Dennis Rodman and, naturally, Elvis Presley are among the aliens outed by this cheeky movie - but as long as they obey the law there's no problem. The jokes are scurrilous, the special effects sensational, but the most amusing notion is that tabloid newspapers are our only reliable source of information. ?Best investigative reporting on the planet,? remarks Jones' veteran alien-buster. ?You can read the New York Times. They get lucky sometimes.? Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>PAWS H H H<br>Teenage blues guitarist Nathan Cavaleri does a plausible job in this far-fetched story of an incredibly smart dog named PC (voice supplied by a very funny Billy Connolly) who manages to toy with a computer's voice emulation software so he too can ?speak?. Younger children might find the slightly morbid opening and the villainous Anya (Sandy Gore) a bit on the creepy side but there's plenty of feel-good family mush in there to balance it. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>A SIMPLE WISH H H ½<br>The idea of a failed male fairy godmother named Murray trying and mostly mucking up attempts to grant a young girl her wish that her dad get the leading role in a Broadway musical is a good one. But it needs more than just loopy facial expressions from Murray (played by Martin Short), or bolshie cuteness from Anabel (Mara Wilson of Mrs Doubtfire fame) to make it work. For a film about magic A Simple Wish lacks too much of it. Rated G (David Watts)<br>WILD AMERICA H H H ½<br>Credibility is stretched at every turn in this far-fetched family adventure inspired by the real-life exploits of three teenage Arkansas brothers (played by Scott Bairstow, Devon Sawa and Jonathan Taylor Thomas) who drive around the country in an old truck carrying an even older 16mm camera during the summer of 1967. However, it adds to rather than detracts from the fun because if everything didn't quite happen in real life as this movie depicts it, it should have. Rated PG (Kevin Thomas - LA Times)<br>DOING TIME FOR PATSY CLINE<br>H H H ½<br>Australian writer-director Chris Kennedy goes country and western in this oddly different tale about a young man's wish fulfilment on the road to Nashville. Engaging performances from Miranda Otto, Richard Roxburgh and Matt Day enliven what is already a vibrant combination of fantasy, romantic comedy, road movie and prison drama. At the Luna. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>KISS OR KILL H H H<br>Australian writer-director Bill Bennett has thrown off all the usual trappings (script, music soundtrack, tripod, continuity editing) to give this story about a pair of sexy con artists on the run from the law and a psychopathic former footy star an energy and pace rare in local movies. Unfortunately, the plot overheats well before reaching its destination, stranding its talented leads Frances O'Connor and Matt Day in the middle of nowhere. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>ULEE'S GOLD H H H H<br>There's something truly eerie about seeing Peter Fonda cast as the patriarch of a family being torn apart by drug problems. Here we have one of the key symbols of the 60s, the generation which was responsible for introducing casual drug taking into mainstream American life, playing a character trying to pull his wretched, strung-out daughter-in-law from the clutches of low-life scum. I'm not sure how conscious was the casting of Fonda as Ulee Jackson, a Vietnam veteran who has found emotional refuge in the gentle rhythms of bee-keeping, but it's mightily effective. It adds depth and poignancy to this moving, beautifully understated story about redemption and the resilience of the family. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING H H H H<br>After a string of big budget flops and near misses, it is a relief to finally see Julia Roberts back on track in this warm, witty and hugely romantic comedy about a woman who sets out to break up the impending marriage of her former boyfriend. Roberts literally bumbles her way through the film, falling off beds, splitting seams and cooking up crazy, mean and downright stupid ideas in a last-ditch attempt to win back Michael (a sadly uncharismatic Dermot Mulroney). Very silly at times, but a treat to watch just the same. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN H H H<br>Directed by Sydney Lumet, Night Falls on Manhattan deals with a young assistant district attorney (Andy Garcia) who is pulled into a major investigation of corruption in the New York Police Department after his veteran cop father (Ian Holm) is badly wounded in a drug bust. While this sounds like the set-up for an action-packed thriller, Lumet is more concerned with psychology and ethics, digging deep into the souls of men who exist in the shadowy world between guilt and innocence. The narrative doesn't quite gell and the climax is a bit underwhelming, but the supporting performances are richly detailed. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSE DANCING<br>A stomach-turning brew of comedy, romance, disease-of-the-week melodrama, magic realism and New Age bunkum, this hugely expensive local production is amateurish. After a breezy first third, in which a couple (played by the unlikely pair of Jack Thompson and Jacqueline McKenzie) try to organise an impromptu wedding on Rottnest Island, the movie makes the most laughably dramatic bungee jump into melodrama that I can ever recall seeing, with Emma announcing she has a terminal illness. At the Revue Cinemas. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL H H ½<br>Jan De Bont virtually redefined the action movie with his devilishly wicked surprise hit about a booby-trapped bus set to explode if it dropped below a certain speed. Unfortunately, trying to recapture the edge-of-the-seat thrills of Speed by setting it on a cruise ship in the Caribbean was not such a bright idea, with too much time convincing us that nobody can get off the boat. Also, the charmingly natural Sandra Bullock is cut adrift far too early, with the rather wooden Jason Patric taking the wheel. But, hey, for $11.50 where else are you going to see a cruise ship crash into an island and split a town in two? Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br></font></p>
