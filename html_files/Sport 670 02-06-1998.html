            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE words ?you idiot? are familiar to lovers of all sports.<br>The Channel 9 Footy Show team even bought a greyhound last week and named it You Idiot in recognition of Sam Newman's favourite description of everything from Eddie Maguire's love of Collingwood and statistics, to his nemesis at Channel 7 - Jason Dunstall.<br>Seven's Rex Hunt uses the words liberally every Sunday morning on the blokefest, the Footy Panel.<br>He may have been aware of over-using them last Sunday when he spared the Sunday Herald-Sun sports editor Scott Palmer.<br>Hunt introduced Palmer as the man who broke the exclusive story that Mick Malthouse was definitely moving to Melbourne - idiotic as it turned out.<br>A goal umpire, two boundary umpires and a field umpire appeared to earn idiot tags after Essendon sealed Hawthorn's fate in the thrilling match on Saturday with a ?goal? that clearly appeared to have hit the post.<br>The ball ricocheted at an angle of 30 degrees, but the only people who saw it were several thousand spectators and the army of armchair fans watching on TV.<br>West Coast fans who left the WACA Ground after Western Bulldogs stunned everyone by thumping the Eagles 8.4 to 0.4 in the first quarter certainly come within the idiot definition.<br>Doubtless, some would have been labelling Malthouse ?you idiot? for starting Jason Ball at full back, Mitchell White deep in defence and Glen Jakovich lonely and frustrated on the half forward line.<br>It required a giant leap of faith to believe the Eagles could come away with more than an honourable defeat.<br>A draw would have been a miracle. One spectator mused that the match appeared to be an extended goal-kicking practice session at the eastern end for first the Bulldogs, then the Eagles.<br>He thought it sporting that the scoreboard retained the details of the practice sessions when the proper arm wrestle started after half-time.<br>The amazing game sent Seven's Bruce McAvaney hoarse and it did not even feature Wayne Carey.<br>However, several correspondents claim the McAvaney-Carey verbal love affair featured during the commentary.<br>When Chris Grant failed to make the distance with a shot after the half-time siren from 50m out, with the Eagles one point up, McAvaney is alleged to have said: ?I reckon Carey would have kicked that.? The brave Docker loss to Collingwood - or should that be Sav Rocca - at hostile Victoria Park was marred by idiots in the crowd who threw bottles on to the field.<br>Seven's cameras appeared to show that the bottles were plastic and possibly used to hold mineral water.<br>How times have changed. Twenty years ago they would have been long-necked Fosters beer bottles made of heavy glass.<br>But at least they would have been empty. No one's that big an idiot - are they?<br>?And a non-footy idiot: The little Englishman doing the commentary for the French Open tennis highlights on Nine yesterday said that Paraguay's Ramon Delgado - conqueror of Pete Sampras - was a name to watch in the future.<br>Unfortunately, he was commentating on the match between Brazilian Fernando Meligeni and Thomas Muster.<br>Wrong country chum.<br></font></p>
