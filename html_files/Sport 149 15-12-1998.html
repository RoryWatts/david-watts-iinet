            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 9 should tape Tony Greig's sign-off from yesterday's Test coverage. ?So that's the end of the day's play. England in serious trouble,? is all he said.<br>And that is all he needs to say the way the old enemy disintegrates so regularly.<br>Nine could save itself space in the commentary box and wages by just replaying the tape - or the England in serious trouble part of it - at random intervals during play.<br>The network might also consider taping Richie Benaud saying ?that's plumb? and give the doyen's voice a bit of a rest.<br>The England batsmen's ineptitude against spin will not let him relax otherwise.<br>The Ashes have become predictable, even dull, viewing. Australians like to see their teams win, but mostly in a good, close fight.<br>The England collapse on Sunday morning became a yawn. Then the sight of Michael Slater and Justin Langer batting properly on Sunday afternoon simply pointed out the chasm between the two countries.<br>Today, we can assume the English tail - which appears to start with captain Alec Stewart - will again trudge off with shoulders sloping and pitiful looks as Colin Miller and Stuart MacGill finish the job.<br>If they don't get them, Glenn McGrath and Damien Fleming surely will.<br>Earlier in the series, critics were being charitable enough, saying that if England could only hold its catches, it would give Australia a huge fright.<br>True enough about the catching, but now the batting is even more cause for concern.<br>And there is more to wreck a couch potato's dream of some good sport. The entire team's state of mind is a worry, according to English experts.<br>Wisden editor Matthew Engel wrote yesterday that Australia has a more skilful generation of cricketers, as well as a more confident one.<br>?England, bowed down by years of being told they are rubbish, now play as if they believe it to be true,? he said.<br>ABC radio guest commentator Jonathan Agnew wrote in yesterday's Guardian about the despair of supporting England in Adelaide.<br>?We've seen so many of these mind-numbing, depressing days before that just one more should not make any difference. But, once again, a sense of total futility has descended on us all,? he said.<br>Neither provided any solutions to a potential problem for Nine: that such lop-sided cricket might be a turn-off.<br></font></p>
