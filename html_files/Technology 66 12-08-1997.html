            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The other day I won three games of Solitaire in a row, each in under four minutes.<br>Hooray, give the man a medal and so what.<br>Well, apart from it being soothing to the ego in a ?small things amuse small minds? kind of way; this hot Solitaire streak reminded me of some computing basics.<br>Solitaire was the first application - if you can call the sometimes infuriating card game that - I ran on a PC with Windows.<br>It is often the way novices learn the intricacies of double-clicking and drag and drop.<br>In some offices, Solitaire is omnipresent on screens where workers make justifiable excuses to supervisors that they are refining their skills. Playing cards ? never.<br>Recently, a review of the beta version of Windows98,(also known as "97 or Memphis) due for full release in the first quarter of next year, claimed the operating system did not include Solitaire.<br>If Microsoft fails to include Solitaire, it will be sacrilege.<br>Without Solitaire something fundamental would be lost. If a new field such as personal computing has a tradition, then surely the humble game is an integral part of it.<br>To preserve sanity, I think we have to assume Solitaire will be there. Sanity goes missing so often in computing. It is a field where marketing and rampant consumerism hold sway.<br>If you bought a new PC two years ago, it would have performed miracles compared with five years earlier.<br>Now it would be treated as a bit of a joke. I am talking here about a typical entry-level machine, costing $3500.<br>This time two years ago, that would have been a486 DX2/66 or DX4/100 for the wealthier. It would have had 8Mb of RAM, a 540Mb hard disk, a dual-speed CD-ROM drive and a 14.4K modem.<br>The OS would have been DOS 6.20 with Windows 3.11 and software may have included MS Office, Encarta and/or MS Works. You can still get that sort of package by browsing the For Sale columns of the classified ads. It will cost you about $600.<br>And if you want to use a computer for day-to-day work or study and hook it to the Net you would have few problems.<br>The rapid changes in computing can give the impression that you must spend between $2500 and $3500 to have a Pentium 200, 16Mb of RAM, a 2Gb disk, 16-speed CD-ROM, 33.6K modem and Windows95.<br>The two areas where the latest enhancements are big advantages when browsing the Net are RAM and the modem.<br>RAM is still good value at about $60 for 8Mb and 33.6K modems can be bought for less than $300.<br>So computing and the Net do not have to be expensive pursuits unless you are a bit of a software tweaker or games player.<br>I know a mining engineer who cannot fit his car in the shed because it is full of old computers, dating from 1980.<br>He is quite happy to hook up an old IBM PC/AT to perform repetitive calculations and regards the 486 motherboard he picked up for a song as almost sinful.<br>So if a person like that, who uses computers every day of his life, is happy with what many consider dinosaurs; why the mad rush to platforms that would have been capable of running a medium-sized corporation 10 years ago?<br>The important thing to do is think what you need a computer for, not to be overawed by the hype and the need to keep up with the Joneses. Just make sure you can play Solitaire.<br></font></p>
