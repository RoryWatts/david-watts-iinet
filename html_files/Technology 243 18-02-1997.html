            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET surfers will be able to view Fox broadcasts free before most people have access to the Foxtel cable network thanks to new technology unveiled last week.<br>The RealVideo system was developed by US Internet software company Progressive Networks for real-time streaming of sound and video on the World Wide Web. Previous systems required that whole video clips be downloaded to a user's computer before they could be played, a time-consuming process. RealPlayer clips are highly compressed and can be played and downloaded simultaneously.<br>Fox News, the US parent company to Australia's Foxtel cable-TV network, which started in Perth earlier this month, is one of the first partners to provide real-time audio and video content for the service.<br>The exclusive world premiere of three Spike Lee films took place last week using the system.<br>?Lee's efforts were designed to demonstrate the wide variety of compelling content that can be produced for Web users,? Progressive said.<br>Other US companies supporting the RealVideo format include C-Span, ABC, Warner Bros, Virgin, and Touchstone Pictures.<br>Foxtel continues to push past WA homes, but some users have complained of long delays to get connected. Foxtel claims to be turning on about 1000 homes a week. At launch only 1000 homes were connected.<br>A Foxtel spokesman said last week that delays of up to three months are likely in some areas even if there was already cable in the street.<br>In the meantime, Realvideo is the next best thing, and it is free.<br>RealVideo is the younger, but more visually tempting, brother of RealAudio, one of the real star applications on the Net that allows live streaming, audio broadcasts - speeches, sports commentary, interviews and music.<br>As its name says, RealVideo is designed to do the same with video.<br>It works too, but is a little like the early snow-plagued days of television.<br>RealVideo can be set up for the average 28.8kbps modem user on a dialup network, but replays are subject to fuzziness, delays, blackouts and total non-appearance. Congestion on servers' lines is mainly responsible, and RealVideo alerts users to that fact in a window under its playback screen.<br>It really is crystal-radio stuff - fascinating that it can be done, but actually lacking in the qualities expected of television.<br>The picture itself is like stop-gap animation, totally out of synch with the good quality audio.<br>However, RealVideo is there because in the not-too-distant future the speed at which we hook up to the Net will be much higher - that is the bandwidth will be bigger.<br>?RealVideo is optimised for today's real world bandwidth capacities. RealVideo delivers newscast-quality video over 28.8 kbps modems, full-motion-quality video using V.56 (56 kbps) and ISDN (56/64 kbps) modems, and near-TV broadcast quality video at LAN rates or broadband speeds (100 kbps and above),? Progressive says.<br>The maker might boast of newscast-quality at 28.8kbps, but it is not wonderful. However, many video presentations can be buffered to deliver better quality after a few minutes' delay.<br>RealVideo is certainly far faster than many video players which require big files to be downloaded for a few seconds play.<br>And if the experience of RealAudio is anything to go by, the quality should get better and better.<br>RealVideo is played on the RealPlayer which overtakes the RealAudio player. Users wishing to update RealAudio will now have to download RealPlayer which will give both audio and video.<br>URLs:<br>www.timecast.com<br>www.realaudio.com<br></font></p>
