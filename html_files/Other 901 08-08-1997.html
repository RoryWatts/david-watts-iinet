            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FOR the third week in a row I will talk about blokes. I wasn't going to, honestly. I actually wanted to write about something completely different . . . like TV, footy, beer or women.<br>But during the week I received a birthday card with a photo of a girl so pleasant to look at, it made me palpitate, pulsate and perspire.<br>She wore tiny white underwear and a scowl. Every part of her was both firm and smooth. Blokes love that. So of course I began to think of blokey things like the ultimate collection of women who appeal to blokes.<br>And lists are so addictive. I'll give up next week, doctor.<br>Bloke sheilas:<br>It sounds oxymoronic, like army intelligence, but this is just a list of women who make the average bloke palpitate, pulsate and perspire.<br>Sophia Loren: Those curves and those eyes are enough, but the lips and the accent make her irresistible.<br>Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman in the film): The body-hugging leather makes blokes want to hug the body.<br>Julie Newmar (as Catwoman on TV): Ditto, but even more appealing because of her height and accent.<br>Geena Davis: Out-bloked even Bond and Arnie in The Long Kiss Goodnight in which she played an assassin with amnesia. She was unforgettable.<br>Helen Mirren: The thinking bloke's ideal companion. Won me when she told the Sunday Times in London how she started her day. ?If my chap's there we make love, then I listen to the BBC world news, then we make love again.?<br>Liz Hurley: Drop-dead gorgeous and sinfully curvaceous. Won blokes' sympathy when let down so publicly by her not very blokey boyfriend, Hugh Grant.<br>But enough of the girls. Blokes have role models, mostly from the world of sport. Let's take a look at them.<br>Bloke blokes:<br>Tony Lockett: No GYM (gorgeous young mum) wants her son to grow up to be like the 110kg Sydney Swans full-forward. But lots of blokes are in awe of his brute power and superb kicking. He also has a gentle wit, according to opposing full-backs. Witness these charming one-liners: ?How would you like to die in front of 35,000 people?? "If you touch my jumper, I'll kill ya.?<br>Glen Jakovich: The West Coast champion has a body that all blokes believe they see in the mirror every morning.<br>Steve Waugh: Tough, quiet and harsh on the Poms; an ideal Aussie bloke.<br>Dennis Lillee: Tough, exuberant and harsh on the Poms.<br>Roy Slavin: The more urbane and articulate member of Roy and H.G.<br>Dermott Brereton: A twinkle in the eye and a ripple in the bicep; what many aspire to.<br>Chris Mainwaring: Ditto with a WA angle.<br>Bloke etiquette. Traditional greeting to fellow bloke: Mate.<br>Happy agreement with fellow bloke (as in a response to ?Chris Lewis, hey?): Maaate.<br>Sad response or disagreement (response to something like ?Mate you ran off with my missus and you took my ute. Is the ute okay??): Maaaate.<br>At a public urinal: Look straight ahead. If caught glancing sideways, discuss the unfairness of Tony Lockett's latest suspension.<br>Washing hands after being at public urinal: Do not look longingly at reflection and comb hair. The next step is unthinkable. Soon you'll be using a blow-drier and opening a flower shop.<br>JUST enough space left for a few jokes. I've made them Irish jokes, but in one of them you could easily substitute Queenslander or New Zealander.<br>An American, an Australian and an Irishman were on Sale of the Century. The question: Complete the following and spell it. Old MacDonald had a ...<br>Buzzzz went the American. Old MacDonald had a ranch ... r-a-n-c-h.<br>Wrong, over to the Aussie. Old MacDonald had a station ... s-t-a-t-i-<br>o-n.<br>Wrong, what do you think Pat? Old MacDonald had a farm ... e-i-e-i-o.<br>And to finish:<br>Q: Who is Irish, white and lies around the pool all day?<br>A: Pati O'Furniture.<br></font></p>
