            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF Richard Court has his way ... and if HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) was a school subject ... I would get six of the best.<br>And rightly so. My declension of HTML and my parsing were appalling.<br>The Kinder, Gentler HTML Validation program at the University of Alberta in Saskatchewan, Canada, told me so when I submitted the source of my home page to them last week.<br>Within a minute of submitting the source HTML (text formating for Web sites) to the Canadian program there was screen after screen of what amounted to ?naughty boy, stay in after school?. The print-out of the report was 13 pages. My home page source takes only a screen and a half.<br>Line after line said I had put the syntax back to front, had used illegal syntax or had missed something altogether.<br>It all ended with a graphic of Homer Simpson over his favourite expression ?D'oh? with an invitation to click the image. Which I did and heard Homer's groan to be the same as my own.<br>It is a humbling experience, validating your HTML, especially when you think it is pretty neat and, after all, your home page works a treat.<br>But the Australasian Web Publishers' Association (AWPA) recommends budding HTML authors do it and learn from the experience, no matter how daunting.<br>AWPA is new to the Web. Its home page originates in Cessnock, NSW, but its aim is to have HTML writers Australia-wide learn from and contribute to its site.<br>Anne Foxworthy, spokeswoman for AWPA, says the group wants to improve the quality of Web sites in Australia and New Zealand.<br>AWPA sees its site as a reference and education area for HTML writers, keeping them up to date with the rapid changes in Web publishing.<br>EVENTUALLY AWPA hopes to be the first entry point of Web publishers and to have a list of professional HTML writers and other Web creators for people to call on when they want to build a site in cyberspace.<br>The HTML validation is just one of a number of goodies offered at AWPA's Useful Box site. It wants to keep up standards on HTML so everyone on the Web has at least one common language.<br>The difficulty at the moment is undoubtedly the Web's own popularity, which allows anyone with the tiniest bit of HTML knowledge to build their own site.<br>This is, of course, good, as is Netscape's forgiving nature as the main Web browser in the world. The software is so sophisticated in its releases after version 1.0 that it will give a user the desired effect even with HTML that is off target.<br>HTML creation software such as HotDog is also so good that it allows people to do some complicated HTML without too much regard for the rules.<br>Which is how I got such a bad mark for my home page.<br>My fundamental flaw was to have no DOCTYPE declaration on my HTML. Without that, validation treated it as HTML 2.0 even though HotDog had allowed me to use many features of HTML 3.0.<br>If I had been learning English, it was the equivalent of me writing an essay about Jane Austen and heading it ?My Hovercraft is Full of Eels?.<br>And some of the sentences would have read: ?Prejudice and Pride is a Mr Darcy intrigue tale of with and Miss Elizabeth Bennet.?<br>AWPA is recommended reading (so is Jane Austen).<br>URL: http://www.awpa.aust.com/index.html<br></font></p>
