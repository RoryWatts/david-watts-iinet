A joke lounge gives people the chance to send in their funnies which are then grouped by type and blueness in the hope of avoiding offence.<br>RELIGION<br>Catholic Archdiocese of Perth<br>www.perth.catholic.org.au<br>THE Catholic Archdiocese of Perth covers more than 380,000 square km and includes 99 parishes.<br>This in itself is remarkable stuff, but the archdiocese now boasts a Web site to rival its geographical achievements. Father Patrick Lim is credited with creating an informative as well as technologically talented set of pages.<br>To the accompaniment of upbeat church music, one can track every parish and priest, read church documents, write to Archbishop Hickey and find out more about the Catholic religion.<br>FILM<br>X-Files movie<br>www.film.com/reviews/<br>rev_coming/previews/<br>1998/10592/<br>THE much-talked about X-Files movie is allegedly one very long episode of the cult TV show. But this film.com site allows surfers to judge for themselves. It offers some tantalising RealPlayer video clips from the film, one entitled ?Mulder and Scully get playful on the rooftop?.<br>And it has dozens of links to reviews, news and all the trivia possible with the X-Files.<br>ART<br>Penny Hudson's Editions Australia<br>www.pennyhudson.com<br>ARTIST Penny Hudson is travelling around Australia, trying to capture its spirit.<br>This site features her colourful work and offers much of it for online sale. It also offers a diary and map of her travels around the continent and gives Net users the chance to e-mail her along the way.<br>TOURISM<br>The Outback Highway<br>www.outback-hwy.gov.au/<br>outback/<br>THE Outback Highway Development Council developed this site to inform people about the building of what it terms ?a visionary concept to provide a third, strategic transcontinental road link stretching almost 1800km from Laverton in WA to Winton in Queensland, via Alice Springs in the Northern Territory?.<br>It is a good idea, using the Web to display images of the vast amount of outback to be traversed as well as providing information on the wide, open spaces along the way.<br>The council believes the route will become a tourist attraction and the drive will be one of the ?must-do? ventures.<br></font></p>
