            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE global hunt for aliens has come unstuck temporarily.<br>The SETI@home experiment which allows home Internet users to receive and analyse satellite data has become a victim of its own popularity.<br>The headquarters of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the US admitted last week that more than 500,000 users around the world had joined the hunt for alien life by downloading the SETI@home program from the Web.<br>?Our servers are occasionally overloaded. If you get a "can't connect to server' message, the problem is probably at our end, not yours,? SETI said.<br>SETI, with the help of Sun Microsystems, is upgrading its server capacity.<br>New versions of the SETI@home software that fix several bugs and respond better to server problems are due for release shortly. The program can be run as a screensaver which has to be connected to the Net. Users can also run it more actively, like any other application.<br>SETI@home analyses the radio signals being received by the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. The program on home computers breaks this data into small chunks - a 10 kilohertz range of wavelengths in a strip of sky visible from the telescope.<br>It then can search the data for patterns, pinpointing irregularities that might come from alien sources.<br>SETI scientists say the data downloaded to each desktop computer take up only about 250k of memory, though the computer must have 32Mb of RAM to run the software.<br>Users can download enough data through the Net in five minutes to keep their computer analysing for days. As the computer works on it, the screen displays a three-dimensional graph charting the signal analysis.<br>SETI@home: setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu<br></font></p>
