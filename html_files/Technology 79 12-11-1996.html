            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SAUSAGE Software's HotDog appeared to lose the plot when the 32-bit version of the popular HTML editor was released earlier this year.<br>In a bid to show that an old dog can learn new tricks, Sausage fitted out HotDog with several floating toolbars, howling dog soundtrack and a bone-shaped toolbar that shrank the editing screen to almost useless proportions.<br>But sanity has prevailed at last and the latest version 3.09 of HotDog Pro is a treat.<br>It made its debut on the Web last month. Frankly I approached the download of the 1.8Mb of support files and the more than 4Mb of program with unease, given the over-the-top result of the last effort.<br>But it was a pleasant surprise. The howling dog soundtrack is there still, but can be removed quickly.<br>Instead of several floating and one big bone-shaped toolbar there are now easily manoeuvrable strip bars which can be hidden at a click.<br>HotDog is again a user-friendly product and has rich features that will appeal to HTML authors from the novice to the professional.<br>It has a page wizard to take newcomers step-by-step through the making of a Web page, easy drop-and-drag image editing, the ability to create image maps, familiar table and list wizards, FTP ability, quick body background creation, and even the ability to seek and place ActiveX objects (for MS Internet Explorer) from your system into a HTML document.<br>That is just a sniff of what is on offer. One of the windows that can be opened on screen is called the sniffer which allows easy recovery of files and even HTML sources off the World Wide Web.<br>And there are three main editing screens, one of which is for straight HTML work, another for document information and the third is an offline browser called Rover which gives a close approximation of how the HTML document will work.<br>Previewing with either Netscape or Explorer is still necessary - and remains an option straight off the toolbar - for an exact look at your work.<br>All this comes at a price after a 30-day free evaluation. The program costs almost $100 to register or either $30 or $70 to upgrade to, depending on the present version you have. It is also recommended you have 16Mb of RAM.<br>Far less weighty, both on the pocket and RAM, is HomeSite, an excellent 32-bit HTML editor that has been on the Web for a few months.<br>Its first release was freeware and brilliantly simple. The new version 2.0, released late last month, is shareware ($US25 after 30 days evaluation) and still simple but with an excellent offline browser-previewer and an easy-to-use body background colour bar.<br>Other features include a multiple document interface that can be displayed on the left of the screen, right-click editing of most common tags, spell checker, and a built-in image and thumbnail viewer.<br>WITH a list of HTML and image files open, a la Windows Explorer, on the left of the screen it is possible to click on an image, say, and immediately be presented with an image wizard to format your document easily.<br>It is possible to open the whole screen to edit mode, an impressive tool for those frustrated with lack of space.<br>URLs: HotDog<br>www.sausage.com.au<br>HomeSite<br>www.dexnet.com/homesite.html<br></font></p>
