            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Recreational Software Advisory Council uses five levels to label World Wide Web sites. Sites are graded 0 to 4 with 0 representing unlimited access.<br>A user can set software like CyberPatrol or the Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 browser to any of these levels and material rated at that level or higher will be blocked.<br>The categories are:<br>Violence Level 0: Harmless conflict; some damage to objects. Level 1: Creatures injured or killed; damage to objects. Level 2: Humans injured or killed; with small amount of blood. Level 3: Humans injured or killed; blood and gore. Level 4: Wanton and gratuitous violence; torture; rape.<br>Nudity/sex Level 0: No nudity or revealing attire; romance, no sex. Level 1: Revealing attire; passionate kissing. Level 2: Partial nudity ; clothed sexual touching. Level 3: Non-sexual frontal nudity; non-explicit sexual activity. Level 4: Provocative frontal nudity; explicit sexual activity; sex crimes<br>Language Level 0: Inoffensive slang; no profanity. Level 1: Mild expletives. Level 2: Expletives; non-sexual anatomical references. Level 3: Strong, vulgar language; obscene gestures. Level 4: Crude or explicit sexual references.<br>Each level can be broken down further for more thorough filtering.<br>For example, Level 1 violence can stipulate not to show sites where creatures are injured or there is damage to realistic objects.<br>Level 2 nudity/sex can ban partial nudity sites but allow passionate kissing, or allow partial nudity and block sites which show ?clothed sexual touching?.<br></font></p>
