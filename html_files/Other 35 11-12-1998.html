            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALL I want for Christmas is: two leather sofas, a cracking big piece of original artwork, a VCR, a Discman, a faster modem, a barbecue on wheels, a new car, the gold-embossed, leather-bound complete Encyclopedia Britannica, the complete works of Spike Milligan, a Ralph Lauren trenchcoat and a variety of polo shirts, some time away, peace and quiet, cures for all known diseases - and all the fruit mince pies I can eat.<br>And I bet you thought I was going to say ?my two front teeth?. Christmas has changed, though.<br>When I was eight or nine (not that long ago really) I remember rolling up to my grandparents' house on the big day to be greeted by my grandad singing:<br>?Christmas is coming<br>The goose is getting fat<br>Please put a penny in the old man's hat.?<br>You try doing that at a 90s Christmas celebration and see if it will break the kids' trance in front of a Nintendo 64 rendering of something like the Mario Brothers Save Christmas, or a film featuring American TV stars turning to sentimental goo as snow falls and reindeer drop from the sky.<br>If the little ones can be bothered to turn their heads, it will only be to say: ?Oh, dad (or mum, or Uncle Ted, or whoever), that's gross (or old-fashioned, or so 70s, or dumb)?.<br>Better live with the fact that the world is not some sepia-toned set of memories full of jolly ho-hos and happy families.<br>It's not all bad, of course. In this line of work, at this time of the year, many people pass on Christmassy thoughts and stories. Some are only vaguely linked to the festive season, however.<br>Like the chronically bad typist who told me she had, at one stage, decided to become a devil-worshipper. The only problem was that she sold her soul to Santa. She also wrote that she was an avid supporter of Manchester Untied, and joined protests against the unclear energy industry. More relevant is this story currently doing the e-mail rounds:<br>Santa was cross. It was Christmas Eve and nothing was going right.<br>The elves were complaining about not getting paid overtime. The reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were in no fit state to fly around the world. Santa dropped a bag of toys in the sleigh, smashing the wooden planks underneath.<br>He went inside to cool off with a cup of coffee and a nip of whisky.<br>But the elves had hidden the booze. Then he dropped the glass coffee pot which shattered into 1000 pieces.<br>He went to get the broom to clean up the fragments, but mice had eaten away all the straw.<br>Just then the doorbell rang. The Christmas Angel opened the front door and stepped in, dragging a Christmas tree. ?Yo, fat man. Where do you want me to stick the tree this year?? asked the angel . . . and so the tradition of angels atop Christmas trees came to pass.<br>THERE is just enough room for a little joke to finish.<br>A helpful blonde has been looking for odd jobs around the plush western suburbs.<br>She fronted up to a house with a big veranda and asked if there was any work to do. ?Yes you can paint my porch. I'll give you $50,? said the owner of the house.<br>His wife was a trifle worried. ?That's a big job for $50. It's a huge porch. She'll take all day.?<br>But an hour later the happy blonde was back at the front door asking for her $50. ?That was fast,? said the owner. ?Oh no trouble,? said the blonde, ?I had enough paint for two coats. ?And by the way . . . it's not a porch, it's a Ferrari.?<br></font></p>
