            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 has proved enormously popular but what do you get when you download the multi-megabyte monster? DAVID WATTS delves into the new features.<br>It is hard to escape Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 on the Net at the moment. Since its worldwide official release on October 1, it has won over many Netscape users but also angered those who feel it is an intrusive product designed to make MS - the world's dominant software company - even bigger.<br>The first thing to know about MSIE 4.0 is that it is much more than a Web browser or even an Internet suite like Netscape Communicator.<br>The now-traditional Netscape-Microsoft browser battle is cast in a whole new light. The browser is just one part of a huge piece of software in both camps.<br>MSIE 4.0 goes further. It can be configured easily as a new-look shell to the operating system, which has to be either Windows 95 or NT at the moment.<br>This shell configuration is almost certainly how the interface on Windows 98 will look and act when released next year.<br>Here are 10 highlights - not necessarily the main ones -- of the program.<br>True full-screen Web browsing - when connected to the Net, the browser toolbar has a full-screen option. When selected, the interface changes dramatically. Web pages now occupy the entire desktop with only a very thin pictorial toolbar. You cannot even see the Start button but you are not stuck. Combinations of control-escape (for the Start menu) or alt-tab (to cycle through applications) still work. It is easy to get back to the traditional browser screen if you need to key in URLs, by pressing the full-screen button on the toolbar.<br>Attractive and flexible toolbar - the toolbar has always been a feature of MSIE. Its modern, graphical look almost certainly influenced Netscape to lift its game with Communicator. Navigator's introduction of the personal toolbar on to which URLs can be dragged for one-click retrieval borrowed straight from the MSIE 3.0 links bar. Now MS has gone one better by enabling folders, applications and documents to be dragged to the toolbar. This follows the philosophy of integrating the Web and the OS. If you're connected to the Net but browsing your OS, you simply click a URL and the main browser toolbar changes to a set of Web applications. You can launch OS applications with one click on the links bar while browsing ? if you need Notepad to copy text from a Web page, for example.<br>Web-OS integration - this is the biggest difference between MSIE 4.0 and Communicator. As the software behemoth of the world, MS feels no compunction in fiddling with the OS and trying to change users' attitude to computers so that the Net is just another nearly seamless application. You don't have to configure MSIE 4.0 to give this shell view. You can use it just as a browser. But the integration is the big feature of the software. Folders can be viewed like Web pages, complete with underlined links. You can fiddle with HTML to personalise your folders and you need only single-click to launch anything.<br>Channels - a controversial feature, finally introducing MS's version of push technology, where packaged Web content can be loaded automatically to the user's hard drive for later off-line retrieval. Its critics say it is corporate-driven and against the spirit of user-driven random browsing.Big companies, particularly information providers, can dominate the Web, an experience more like passive receipt of television than active pursuit of Web knowledge.However, the use of channels is not mandatory even though they are hard to ignore on the interface. Indeed, selective subscription to channels can take away some tedium and speed up browsing, allowing more time for a random surf.<br>Australian content - early betas of MSIE 4.0 had only US channels, giving the feeling that we were being Coca-Colonised. There is enough American TV without being in thrall to CNN, NBC and ESPN. But MS has made several different versions of Explorer so that if you correctly download the Australian one you can choose from the ABC, Channel 9, Channel 7, Fairfax, News Limited and Ziff Davis Australia.You can choose channels from anywhere while surfing if the content provider has programmed special packages.Subscribing is fairly painless, with choices of how often you want updates and how they are to be notified -- by e-mail or special icon on the task bar.<br>Plug-ins and speed - MSIE 4.0 seems faster than Netscape and handles Java - which can cause grief with snail-like slowness and crashes - very smoothly. Plug-ins such as RealVideo are handled effortlessly too.<br>Outlook Express Mail and News - once this could not hold a candle to Netscape Mail and News. Now it matches it for ease of use, flexibility and is more attractive, if that is important to you. It needs a bit of study to configure but a big attraction is the ease of importing mail from other programs such as Netscape and Eudora Pro. You can also import your Netscape address book in seconds, saving valuable set-up time.<br>Mail - a very good e-mail package, it allows sending and receipt in HTML as well as filtering so you can direct mail to different folders or even trash it. Attractive HTML images and borders can be chosen as a template, but recipients won't get the benefit of this cleverness unless their e-mail program displays HTML. It all seems a far cry from the unwieldy Microsoft Exchange days.<br>Search pane - when you choose search from the browser toolbar, a pane offering a choice of major engines such as AltaVista or Lycos drops down on the left screen. Choose your engine, key in the word or words and the results fill the right screen. Click on search again and the whole screen is used for the results and subsequent pages.<br>History - like channels, favourites and search, history operates from a pane to the left of screen. It shows the days of the week you went surfing. Click the day and the domains you visited are displayed. Click one of those and all the pages you visited are available. History is very useful when browsing in off line mode. MSIE 4.0 allows surfing of your cache. A circle is displayed when you move the cursor over a page that is not cached. Search, channels, favourites and history panes are more effective in full-screen display because they interfere with page views only marginally.<br>And now for the bad news on IE4.0<br>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 is good - but it is not all beer and skittles. To counter the 10 highlights of the program, here are five fairly general lowlights to think about.<br>Computing power: You need a lot of grunt to even consider running it; fine if you have a new PC or have the money to upgrade, not so good if your machine is older than about two.<br>Software library TUCOWS (The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software) is advising people that the minimum requirements are Win95 or NT, a 66Mhz processor, 8Mb of RAM for 95, 16Mb for NT, and 50Mb of hard disk space. It recommends at least a Pentium 133 with 32Mb of RAM.<br>Platform: At the moment the full release is available for Win95 or NT only. Versions for Windows 3.x, the Mac and Unix are about a month away. Even then, the full integration of MSIE 4.0 will not be possible, for Macs or Unix at least. So it will mainly be a matter of choosing it as an Internet suite.<br>Size: It is a whopper, weighing in at 16Mb unzipped in its standard form, and takes more than two hours to download at 28.8K. If you want more functionality - such as Internet collaboration, chat software, Web authoring and publishing tools - it will be 24Mb. The standard version grows to 35Mb when unzipped. If you have 16Mb of RAM, your PC might be noticeably slower.<br>Channels: Both Microsoft and Netscape (with Netcaster) are making a big deal about push technology, or the ability to have Web sites updated automatically and sent to your PC.<br>But whether it is a better way to surf is very debatable. Channels, even though MS has included Australian ones, are complicated and non-intuitive. Newer users might find them totally unfathomable.<br>Choice: At the moment you can choose to run whatever browser you like. MS is trying to make MSIE 4.0 mandatory with new Windows machines. This would rob Net users of the ability to find neat and fast software such as Eudora (for e-mail), Netscape, Free Agent (for news) or Homesite (for HTML).<br>HELP DESK<br>Internet Explorer: www.microsoft.com/ie<br></font></p>
