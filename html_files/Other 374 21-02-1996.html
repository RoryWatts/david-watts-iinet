            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO very different independents are the first Australians to use the Internet as their main Federal campaign tool.<br>One is a disenchanted Labor voter, Arthur Galletly, who is standing for the WA seat of Brand.<br>The other is Morris Jones, a 24-year-old computer science graduate who is so interested in the Internet that he helps edit a magazine on the subject. Mr Jones is bidding for a Senate seat in New South Wales.<br>Mr Galletly - who prefers to be known as Arthur though his full name is Clive Philip Galletly - has told Net users he was not seeking campaign donations. But he has invited them to look at his online catalogue of CD-ROMs.<br>In a seven-page site on the WorldWide Web, Mr Galletly says he is disenchanted with Labor yet refuses to vote Liberal because he is disgusted with unemployment rates, Labor's loss of traditional values, the Liberal industrial relations policy and the creation of a big number of welfare dependants.<br>Under the catchcry ?the easiest way to create full employment is to create full employment?, he says Australia should employ people to clean up beaches, have crossing attendants at every school, plant a billion trees and restore modest tariffs on consumer goods to rebuild the manufacturing industry.<br>Mr Galletly uses the Web site to detail his pet project - a canal from the west coast to the east, which he says will be good for transport, desalination and tourism.<br>Mr Jones's platform is seeing Australia reach its full potential, particularly through science and technology.<br>As well as a computer science degree, he has a master's in journalism and is assistant editor of Internet Australasia.<br>?Australians have a proven track record as some of the most innovative people in the world, yet we consistently lose our great ideas to other nations,? he says in his campaign site.<br>?Australia must develop these products and concepts locally to make sure that the money stays in this country.?<br>He also is concerned about the cost of Internet and telecommunications services and will support policies to make it easier for Australian firms to promote themselves internationally.<br>Both men are the first of a new wave of political candidates giving e-mail addresses on the Net. Mr Galletly's is galletly@southwest.com.au and Mr Jones's is morris@interaus.net.<br></font></p>
