            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton brought his golf pro with him on last week's flying visit to Australia.<br>It shows just how important the practice of hitting - often mis-hitting - a little white ball has become.<br>Some historians feel that golf originated in the Netherlands because the Dutch word kolf means club. But the Romans had a game played with a bent stick and a ball made of feathers that might have been the original source of the game.<br>Many historians are certain, however, that the game we love and hate started in Scotland in the 14th or 15th century. Golf became so popular in Scotland that to keep people from playing golf and football during the time they should have been practising archery - a military necessity - the Scottish Parliament passed a law prohibiting both games in 1457.<br>Most ignored this and by the early 16th century King James IV took up the game. His granddaughter Mary, later Mary, Queen of Scots, took the game to France, where she was educated. The young men who attended her on the golf links were known as cadets (pupils); hence the term caddie.<br>By the 18th century the first golf associations were established. They included the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (1744); the St Andrews Society of Golfers (1754), which in 1834 took its present name, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews; and the Royal Blackheath (1766), near London where, according to tradition, golf was introduced to England in 1608.<br>Golf now has millions of adherents throughout the world with phenomenal growth in South-East Asia.<br>Golf<br>Who's hot<br>Golf World magazine runs a points system ranking that covers all players - men and women - in major tournaments.

Some have been special for other reasons. Here are a few:<br>Gene Sarazen's albatross:<br>The Masters at Augusta is the youngest of the four championships that make up The Majors.<br>It was first played in 1934 and one year later was brought to the forefront by one shot. Gene Sarazen needed three birdies to catch Craig Wood who had finished on 282. He got them in one blow by holing his four-wood second at the par-five 15th. He easily beat the shattered Wood in the play-off.<br>Jacklin's hole-in-one:<br>In 1965 during the Dunlop Masters, Britain's Tony Jacklin recorded the first televised hole-in-one. He became more famous five years later for holding both the US and British Opens at the same time.<br>Trevino's chip:<br>In 1972 Tony Jacklin had his second British Open in his pocket. On the 17th in two and with Lee Trevino, one shot ahead, through the back in four, Jacklin looked the winner. Trevino outrageously holed his chip (it would have gone 10 metres past if it had missed) Jacklin three-putted and Trevino had successfully defended the title he won the previous year.<br>Nicklaus' putt:<br>In 1986 Nicklaus, aged 46 and without a win in six years, went to The Masters at Augusta and played the back nine in 30 strokes to win. The highlight was his 15 metre downhill putt at the 16th for a birdie 2.<br>Mize's killer:<br>In the second hole of the playoff for the 1987 Masters, Greg Norman was on the green safely in two. Larry Mize was 40 metres wide to the right. Mize overhit his running pitch but it was stopped by the hole. A three. Norman's two putts were inevitable and gave Mize the famous green jacket.<br>Golf sayings<br>Lee Trevino, winner of six major titles, is one of the funniest men in the game. Here are a few of his sayings.<br>?Go on, hit it again while you're still mad.?<br>?A metre putt to win the US Open? That was no pressure, second prize was a lot of money. Playing for $10 when you have $5 in your pocket. That's pressure.?<br>?That pitch settled like a butterfly with sore feet.?<br>Mr Nicklaus plays a game with which I am not familiar, - the great Bobby Jones on Jack Nicklaus.<br>It is amazing. The more I practise, the luckier I get, - Gary Player.<br>I think we are paid far too much. We are not worth it, Tom Watson, winner of eight Majors.<br>Bobby would absolutely annihilate me. You have no idea how good he was, - Francis Ouimet, first US-born winner of the US Open on Bobby Jones.<br>Never hurry, never worry, and don't forget to stop and smell the roses on the way, - Walter Hagen.<br></font></p>
