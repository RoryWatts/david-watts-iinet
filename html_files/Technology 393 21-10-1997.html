            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TechWeb<br>Technology sites abound on the Internet. There's HotWired, the ever-growing cnet stable, not to mention computer sections within most of the major search engines.<br>Then there's TechWeb, ?the technology supersite? with news, product reviews, and links to spin off sites for shareware, games and ?net celebrities?, where you can read and listen to interviews with key players and technology commentators. One of its best features is its technology encyclopaedia. With 10,000 definitions, it's a good place to start if you don't know a bit from a byte. You can also download a free demo of the multimedia version of the database. (SY)<br>WEB DESIGN<br>AGD Cafe<br>The Australian Graphic Design Cafe is pitched at more experienced Web authors and designers but still has a lot to offer novices. Its philosophy is to collect feedback to form a pool of design knowledge that will help all. As its creators admit, there is not an overwhelming amount on offer but the site is well designed enough for that to change.<br>Categories of interest include news of the latest developments in Web design, tips and tricks with HTML, Adobe Photoshop and Quark XPress, as well as the newly launched Cafe Wow site which enables users to submit sites they feel are well designed. Cafe Webheads will then award up to five coffee cups for sites of the week. (DW)<br>MEDICAL<br>ER Watch<br>The ER Watch site provides a remarkable statistical resource for anybody interested in the type and number of emergencies facing medical staff every day.<br>The site is basically a searchable database of real emergency cases from 100 hospitals across the US. The lists are searchable by type of item involved in the emergency - prams, for example - and what part of the body was involved.<br>So if you ever wanted to know how many people have unfortunate accidents on bicycle-bars, this is the place to find out.<br>As well as statistical information, there are detailed case studies, such as a woman who narrowly avoided a liver transplant after taking too many painkillers. (HC)<br>TOURISM<br>Discover West Holidays<br>Planning a holiday in WA? Travel wholesale company Discover West Holidays has set up a Web site that reflects the content of its 36-page colour magazine, West Australia.<br>Whether you're planning a four-wheel driving tour of the North-West or a self-drive holiday of the southern wine region, you're sure to find something of interest.<br>Colour photographs, accommodation details, tour prices and brief explanations of each region are all featured. And even if you don't have time to get away to Monkey Mia or any exotic far-flung locale there are plenty of suggestions on what to do around Perth, Fremantle and Rottnest as well as information and rates on city hotels. There's also a handy event calendar to help plan your leisure time. (SY)<br>PERTH<br>Access<br>The radical traffic plans to transform Perth by early next century are on show at this Department of Transport site. The simple, well-designed site gives an overview of the plans to unclog traffic in the city and how everything will work when the Graham Farmer Freeway (Northbridge Tunnel for the unconvinced) is completed in 2000.<br>Highlights are numerous maps showing changes to traffic flow and the ability to send e-mail submissions about the plans. (DW)<br>CULTURE<br>alt.culture<br>Steven Daly and Nathaniel Wice's book, Alt.Culture: An A-Z guide to the 90s, translates well to the Web. The 990 entries at this site cover everything from a commentary on Absolutely Fabulous to a definition of the techno-paganistic ?zippies? - or new age hippies.<br>The writing by Daly and Wice is intelligent and, unlike many other encyclopaedic listings of so-called contemporary culture, actually interesting to read. Things you know about already are refreshingly rehashed and there will probably be plenty here you will be glad to learn.<br>The ?random? button, which randomly pulls up one of the entries, is a good feature - you are less likely to simply keep pulling up pages on people you already know. Hot links throughout the text are the hallmark of a thoroughly researched guide.<br>Like the great encyclopaedic works of the past, the site reassures the reader with its implication of a stable universe from which to judge the shifting cultural ground of the age.
