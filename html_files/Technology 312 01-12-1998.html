            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AS Bill Lawry would say: ?It's all happening.?<br>America Online's acquisition of Netscape for nearly $7 billion last week has been hailed by the computer industry - not to mention the burgeoning online industry - as the end of the era of the single technology superpower (for which, read Microsoft).<br>It has also been called the beginning of the Internet revolution.<br>AOL's huge customer base hooked up with Netscape browsers using Java technology provided by Sun, which is also part of the deal, is seen as a rich source of fodder for the hungry e-commerce market.<br>The argument goes that use of Java on openly-sourced Netscape provides the ideal platform from which to shop online because the technology will be far more flexible than anything provided by Microsoft.<br>The companies said last week they would develop an e-commerce package for businesses that want to sell goods online. Sun will provide the underlying Java-based operating software, Netscape will provide the applications that run on it, and AOL will drive traffic to the sites from the AOL and Netscape portals on the Web.<br>The technology will translate easily to digital TV where the Net will be offered as another channel in the not-too-distant future.<br>That is the big picture, and a pretty exciting one it is too.<br>It makes many assumptions. Number one is that AOL users are suddenly all going to become Netscape users.<br>The world's biggest ISP currently supplies an ornate proprietary browser, with many little help windows, powered by Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>The deal that made IE the browser on AOL was one of the reasons many computer companies cried foul about Microsoft ?bullying?.<br>Is that deal just going to go away now? Microsoft will certainly have something to say about that.<br>And if Netscape becomes AOL's browser engine, will millions of users suddenly switch, and upload and install the latest so they can shop till they drop?<br>Maybe, maybe not. What is revealed countless times is that Internet users tend to make up their own sweet minds about such things.<br>Many prognostications are made about the Web and online commerce, but so often the user - a real person - is treated as a digit that is easily multiplied, manipulated and extrapolated.<br>The result always seems to be a future filled with millions of compliant couch potatoes busting their credit card limits with the touch of a mouse key.<br></font></p>
