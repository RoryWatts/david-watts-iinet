            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU may not have noticed, but in the past five or six years big changes have been happening in sex. Not the actual act; that has remained much the same since Adam's voice broke. No, by sex, I mean gender.<br>Youths are wearing their testosterone on the outside more and more.<br>Very short razor haircuts, considered the essence of dagginess in the 1960s and 70s, are commonplace as are horrific shirts and baggy trousers.<br>Girls have cut with the feminine look in casual wear; lots of shorts, tanktops, short socks and heavy boots.<br>When they dress to kill, however, they show more flesh than their swinging 60s and 70s counterparts (often their own mothers) ever dared.<br>I am no expert, just an observer, but it appears to me our young people - and more than a few who have been through several fads - are asserting their sexuality like never before.<br>In the US, the phenomenon is known as dudes and babes, in the UK it's lads and lasses.<br>As far as I know no phrase has been coined for Australian youth strutting their stuff. Perhaps we should know them as we always have; blokes and sheilas.<br>The sensitive new age guy appears to have slunk out the back door ... to bring in the washing. In the front door, the bloke strolls with a twinkle in his eye for the sheilas, a big thirst and a penchant for sport.<br>The sheila greets him with a swagger, a glimpse at her navel ring and a demand to go mountain bike riding, long distance running or drinking down the pub to the roar of a rock band.<br>At the pub, blokes and sheilas both drink straight from the stubby ... no Tia Maria and milk or something with a giraffe stick and umbrella in it for today's girl.<br>It is quite refreshingly different from the days when a woman's place was in the home (50s), when the earth mother ruled but didn't actually make the bread, except the eating kind (60s and 70s), or when shoulder-padded, suit wearers strode down the Terrace like carnivores (the 80s).<br>It is a more honest approach to both the differences and similarities in men and women that gives rise to the 90s bloke and sheila.<br>And let's be honest, there are many differences.<br>Again I can only draw on my own observations (one-eyed though they may be). Here are just a few:<br>?When my daughter was five and my son two, she put on a Nativity play for her grandma using toys. It was sweet and lovely, but as Mary and Joseph rode a My Little Pony to the stable my son jumped on a couch in front of everyone, took down his pants and shouted ?look at my bottom.?<br>?A female friend who attended a convent told me the nuns used to warn the girls not to over-polish their shoes lest boys used the reflection to look at the girls' underwear.<br>To her horror, I told her this was a necessary precaution as boys, from about the age of 6 (when they don't know why) to about 96 (when they can't remember why) will do anything to look at a girl's knickers.<br>?Five years ago my senior high school class had a 20th reunion in Queensland which I couldn't attend because the swine of a chief sub-editor here had rostered me to work and I hadn't won Lotto (as usual).<br>The girls of the class organised the event, sending out notices and tracking all 52 students down all over the world a full year before the actual event, which was very successful, I'm told.<br>So successful that the boys said they would organise a 25th. That should have been this year and no one's heard a thing. Sheilas seem to be the only ones capable of getting events such as this organised.<br></font></p>
