            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TELEVISION is a flawed news medium. It needs pictures, and preferably active ones, before an event can be considered newsworthy.<br>This was never better illustrated than on Monday night when the dull State election campaign provided the spectacle of two grown men arguing like schoolboys in a radio debate.<br>A radio debate? Yes, the intricacies of modern campaigning mean that what could be once hidden is now beamed into living rooms. The hidden quantity used to be angry faces, sweating brows, loosened ties (if any) and blushes.<br>But the debate between Premier Richard Court and Opposition Leader Geoff Gallop on Howard Sattler's 6PR show was to have none of this.<br>All the media came to see what television news later hyped as the first no-holds barred confrontation of the campaign.<br>Instead of relaxed leaders delivering articulate opinions in an air of civility, viewers got to see two thoroughly well-groomed men going at each other as if one had forgotten to return the other's yo-yo ... and wouldn't own up.<br>And TV made great play of this first real televisual event.<br>Channel 7 used the debate as a golden opportunity to pump its televised debate between the two next Monday. It led the main news bulletin with the Voice of the People segment - actually it is more the Voice of reporter Geof Parry.<br>Much of the footage concentrated on a composed Mr Court and an angry Dr Gallop. Whether that was the case throughout the debate is impossible to tell from Seven's coverage.<br>Like all news media, Seven made a big play about Liberal Party advertisements during the radio program upsetting the Labor leader. Parry claimed Labor had been offered the spots as well.<br>In Channel 10's earlier coverage of the debate - which also had its lead item with lots of close-ups of shouting men - reporter Simon Dowding said Labor denied being offered advertisement spots.<br>Ten made similar plays of an angry Dr Gallop during most of its coverage and, like Seven, most shots of Mr Court were in composed moments.<br>Both highlighted the Premier's exasperated retort to a Gallop outburst: ?If you shut up for a minute, I'll tell you.? Ten played it twice.<br>Dowding did do what Parry didn't - he covered a few of the issues, like taxes that the debaters actually debated.<br>Seven's coverage made it look like Dr Gallop and Mr Court met with no other intention than to sledge each other.<br>Channel 9 and the ABC both relayed more balanced looks at the debate, showing there were times when Dr Gallop was composed and that Mr Court was angry.<br>Seven dominates news ratings and its coverage would have left the impression that our political leaders are unable to tackle serious issues intelligently and responsibly. More balanced coverages also gave that impression.<br></font></p>
