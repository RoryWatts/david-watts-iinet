            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE five days leading up to Anzac Day in 1995 were bloke heaven.<br>Channel 7 showed an AFL round that never seemed to end.<br>And Channel 10 telecast the third Test from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, in which Australia succumbed to the West Indies and Curtly Ambrose took nine wickets.<br>Entertainer Greg Champion summed up a lot of couch potatoes' feelings when he sang, on the Footy Show, a number entitled Four Days of Footy and Five Nights of Cricket on TV. It did not quite happen the way Champion envisaged, with the Test finishing in three days, but it was wall-to-wall, top-quality sport.<br>And a very rare occurrence.<br>Nothing like it will happen this year, either around Anzac Day, or in the weeks before.<br>None of the free-to-air TV networks is covering the tour of the Windies, leaving the after-midnight Tests to pay-TV's Fox Sports.<br>This means a few thousand in WA will have the privilege of watching what promises to be an Australian rout of a once-feared opponent - and suffering insomnia.<br>That is the trouble for free TV of course. Action in the four Tests will be confined to the very early mornings. There is little reason to think any but the most hard-core cricket watchers will stay up to boost ratings and give advertisers a return.<br>Either that, or they will tape the cricket and fast-forward past the commercial breaks.<br>Channel 9 in 1991 and Ten in 1995 learnt this lesson the hard way, despite trying new coverage tricks like spin-cam (on Ten) and holiday-style marketing (on Nine).<br>Pay-TV stands to attract some subscribers by showing the Tests, and also add to its reputation for tackling tours that conventional TV, with its ratings-driven philosophy, puts in the too-hard basket.<br>Fox did a reasonable job in Pakistan late last year with David Hookes leading a team that was lucky enough to show Mark Taylor's record-equalling innings of 334.<br>All of which does nothing to help the majority of cricket lovers.<br>Then again, you could mount an argument that cricket viewers have been spoiled this season with the extensive coverage of the Ashes Tests and the one-day series.<br>The betting and bookie scandals, the Sri Lankan rumpus, plus Taylor's retirement, have all kept the game firmly in the public eye.<br>Could it be a case of too much cricket on TV? Or, should we be wary of the West Indian experience - where American satellite TV showing basketball has lessened the passion for cricket among young West Indians - and keep plumping for maximum coverage of the game?<br>Whatever the answer, West Indies Tests seem destined to be always in the category of must-see sports that are rarely seen.<br>This category also includes sports featuring champions like golfer Karrie Webb, pole vaulter Emma George and wheelchair athlete Louise Sauvage, among many others. They appear only briefly on our screens.<br>But that is another story.<br></font></p>
