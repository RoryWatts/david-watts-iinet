            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET users are mostly in their 30s, white, male, wealthier than average and on the verge of shopping electronically, according to the biggest survey of Net users.<br>But the US Graphic, Visualisation and Usability Centre in Georgia says its latest survey shows that more women are plugging into cyberspace.<br>GVU started doing online surveys of the Net in January 1994. They were the first such surveys, indicating what a new medium the Net is.<br>The difference in results between the first survey and the fourth - in October-November 1995 - also shows the dynamic growth and change of the Net.<br>More than 4700 people took part in the first survey. By the fourth, the number had accelerated to 23,000.<br>Whereas the biggest slice of users in 1994 was aged between 21 and 25, in 1995 the average age was 31.<br>The 1994 male-female ratio was 95 per cent to 5 per cent. Last year it was close to 70-30.<br>More than 97 per cent used Mosaic to browse the World Wide Web in 1994.<br>With the introduction of Netscape Navigator midway through 1994, Mosaic now seems steam driven in comparison.<br>Unix was the favoured operating platform in the first survey (88.5 per cent), but by the end of last year 61 per cent were operating with Windows and 20 per cent of those were using Windows 95, which the survey authors claim showed an explosion in new users.<br>?These numbers support the hypothesis that the Web is now midstream in its evolution, with the first stages being dominated primarily by the technology developers (Unix based) followed by wider acceptance by the ?early adopters/seekers? (PC and Mac based) in the later stages,? the authors say.<br>This new wave of users said they browsed the Web simply for surfing (79 per cent of the time), entertainment (64 per cent) and work (52 per cent).<br>More than 78 per cent browsed daily, but 66 per cent of European users and 59 per cent of Americans spent six hours or less on the Web.<br>By far the biggest problem was the time taken to view or download pages (69 per cent) followed by not being able to find a page (34 per cent).<br>The majority of users - 60 per cent - said they communicated via modem at 14.4kbps or 28.8k. Nearly 34 per cent connect at 14.4 and 27 per cent at 28.8. But 15 per cent more users than the third survey were now connecting at 28.8.<br>The survey says the results of the fourth survey indicate a likely growth of business-to-business use followed by commercial transactions.<br>?Our results indicate that users still do not spend much time shopping but prefer to use the Web for entertainment and work/research,? the survey said.<br>Weak security for credit card transactions was cited as a major disadvantage to Net shopping.<br>Television was one of the biggest losers. The survey showed a majority of people saying they surfed the Web instead of watching television.<br></font></p>
