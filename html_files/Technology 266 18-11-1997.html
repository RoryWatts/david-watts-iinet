            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">In its latest effort to stem its losses and shrinking market share, Apple announced major changes last week in the way it designs, builds and distributes personal computers.<br>The California-based company - which has lost nearly $2.8 billion in its past two fiscal years while its share of the personal computer market declined to 4.5 per cent from 7.4 per cent - unveiled three machines that Apple said will run software faster than its previous models.<br>Apple also introduced a direct-sales program using the Internet as well as existing distributors. In addition, Apple will offer its computers on a ?built-to-order? basis, following the successful direct-sales model of bigger PC makers, such as Dell and Gateway 2000.<br>?We're changing everything we do: the products we make, the way we make them and the way we sell them,? Apple's co-founder and interim chief executive, Steve Jobs, told a gathering of company employees, software developers and reporters.<br>?We're opening things up and giving our customers what they've been asking for ? Apple is listening. We're making changes,? Mr Jobs emphasised. Interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs touts the virtues of its new G3 line of PowerMacintoshes.Australians and people from other countries will still have to make do with their existing reseller networks.<br>And though analysts generally applauded Apple's distribution strategy as a necessary step, some questioned whether the company was really addressing the root causes of its decline or merely taking small, cosmetic measures.<br>The new distribution methods ?are blocking and tackling issues - nothing that will save the company,? said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Research International in San Jose.<br>?For Apple to grow, it has to attract new users. And I want to know what Apple is doing to sell and improve the Macintosh platform.?<br>Mitch Mandich, Apple's senior vice-president for the Americas, said the introduction of faster products and the opening of new sales channels will represent a big step in restoring the company to profitability.<br>?This has to reinvigorate Apple,? Mr Mandich said, adding the company ?must put its viability questions? behind it.<br>A line of new Apple Macintoshes, using the PowerPC G3 chip, was introduced with the Apple Store.<br>The computers maintain the look of previous PowerPC computers but provide significantly improved performance.<br>Tiny island gets into domain name game<br>The South Pacific island nation of Niue is selling its national postal code, NU, to companies worldwide that cannot get an Internet address ending in ?.com? or the name of another country.<br>?Because Niue is a little-known country, unlike Japan or the United Kingdom, for example, its Country Code domain name carries little national identity outside its borders,? according to .NU Domain, the company selling the addresses.<br>Addresses ending in ?.NU? offer an ideal solution, in their opinion, for companies seeking to establish their online presence.<br>Web site addresses correspond to a numerical system enabling them to automatically route visitors and e-mail to the appropriate servers.<br>The US company Network Solutions (NSI) is in charge of the most widespread classifications: ?.com? for commerce, ?.net? for research activities and ?.org? for non-profit organisations. It monitors the registration of addresses and transmits constant updates of registered addresses to computers on the Net.<br>But NSI is facing an explosion in demand for addresses, and the precious domain names, the most practical Internet addresses that correspond to the name of the company using them or reveal the content of a site - such as ?careerpath.com? - are being exhausted.<br>Another type of classification is based on geography. It is composed of letters designating the site's country of origin (?.fr? for France, for example).<br>In this system, according to .NU Domain, there are several constraints and high costs that limit their use.<br>Most requests for Internet registration with .NU Domain, according to the company, already come from foreign countries including Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, the Philippines, Singapore, Sweden and the US.<br>NU is pronounced ?new? and has resulted in certain sites coming up with addresses such as really.nu, its.nu and so.nu.<br>Grapple with the Spice Girls<br>The global marketing phenomenon that is the Spice Girls has made it to the world of gaming consoles with the announcement of a Spice World CD for the Sony PlayStation.<br>The PlayStation Spice World offering appears to be more ?interactive entertainment? than game and will contain video footage, music, and interviews with the female pop group.<br>Sony claims there is plenty of footage on Spice World which has never been released and a ?real-time interactive dancing? section enables users to choreograph their own moves.<br>Another facet of Spice World will be the ability to mix your own Spice Girls tracks from a selection of samples taken from existing songs.<br>A mouse with feelings<br>The term ?user friendly? could soon become a touchy-feely experience for personal computer users if a new Silicon Valley company succeeds in bringing a new PC mouse to market next year.<br>The small company, Immersion Corporation, said its new FEELit Mouse will enable users to feel items ranging from words and columns on a spreadsheet to fast-moving objects in a 3D computer game.<br>The technology transforms the experience of using a mouse - the hand-held device invented roughly 25 years ago and used to point at graphical objects and manipulate them.<br>The new device works by using force-feedback to push the mouse back at the user in different ways, emulating various touching experiences. A user can feel the scratching sensation when drawing a line on a simulated piece of paper, or feel an object stretch as they reshape it.<br>It can even help people grope their way around pages the Web by enabling surfers to literally feel the location of links to other Web sites and by adding realism to 3D sites.<br>?You could conduct a tug of war over the Internet,? Immersion chief executive officer Louis Rosenberg said. ?You could imagine feeling your way through a maze. People have the ability to add sensations.?<br>Immersion, based in San Jose, California, is privately held but has a big-name backer in the form of microprocessor giant Intel, which has invested an undisclosed amount for a stake in the start-up.<br>Research targets mobile phones<br>Mobile phones may heat up your brain, interfere with heart pacemakers and cause cancer in mice. But there is no scientific evidence to support fears that the increasing use of mobile phones may threaten human health, according to scientists from 10 countries who met in Vienna recently.<br>The group did agree to intensify research into radio frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF), which emanate from mobile phones.<br>?This is something that we hold as a high priority. We want to find out if these electromagnetic fields do produce cancer,? said Michael Repacholi, an Australian who heads the international EMF project of the World Health Organisation.<br>?This is going to take time. I know everyone wants answers tomorrow but this is just not possible.?<br>The EMF project, launched last year, is a five-year $5 million program to study possible health hazards stemming from exposure to mobile phones and other EMF sources.<br>?Under certain circumstances, EMF can be potentially hazardous and the risk to a person's health depends on the level of exposure,? Dr Repacholi said.<br>?To date, health research in this area has been largely ad hoc and totally uncoordinated at the international level.?<br>Web copyright row settled<br>The squabble between two newsmen in the far north of Scotland that many saw as a threat to the freedom of the Net has been settled out of court.<br>Agreement between the Shetland Times and Shetland News was brokered after some moments of technological farce in the Edinburgh Court of Sessions last week.<br>For 13 months the sides have been involved in a dispute that has brought into question a legal issue striking at the fundamental nature of the Web - the ability to link directly to pages on someone else's site.<br>The accusation by the Shetland Times newspaper was that the Shetland News online agency was linking directly to the paper's news stories on the Web without either permission or acknowledgement. The Edinburgh courtroom had been wired for links to the Web to demonstrate technical points in the dispute. However, a report at the Shetland News site said: ?It quickly became clear that contact with cyberspace could not be established via the court's telephone system.<br>?Lord Hamilton adjourned the hearing as engineers crawled around the floor trying to fix the problem.?<br>In any event the court did not have to rule on the matter. After the technology-enforced adjournment the two sides agreed that the News could link to the Times so long as it followed certain conditions. These were that each link had also to feature a logo and an attribution ("A Shetland Times story?), which were to be linked to the Times list of headlines.<br>A court verdict would have been binding in Scotland only. But, according to the Guardian newspaper in London, it would have been a legal precedent affecting copyright. And it would guide courts on Internet-related matters throughout the world.<br>HELP DESK<br>Apple online store: store.apple.com<br>Immersion: www.force-feedback.com<br>Shetland Times:www.shetland-times.co.uk<br>Shetland News:www.shetland-news.co.uk<br></font></p>
