            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE uniqueness of the Internet and its staggering growth have been emphasised as reasons why attempts to regulate or censor it are doomed to failure.<br>Submissions to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's inquiry into online services closed on Friday. All 47 public submissions made available on the World Wide Web stressed that providers of information on the Net were users as well.<br>The Net was not a traditional broadcast medium where businesses supplied information to passive users.<br>The users provided the bulk of information themselves and accessed and updated information all over the world at great speed.<br>Kim Heitman, spokesman for the WA Internet Association, made the point in a 21-page submission that it would take several months even to map the topography of the Net, assuming it remained static, again making regulation of information providers and users useless.<br>Mr Heitman said self-regulation would be adequate for the Net in Australia.<br>The WAIA's submission, like most to the ABA, pointed out that because of its active nature, users of the Net had to look for their information. Adult users were used to the freedom of seeing or hearing what they wanted.<br>The ABA was attacked as ?lamentable? for saying in its issues paper on online services that content providers should be aware of the information passing through networks.<br>The WAIA said this was impossible because of the sheer bulk of content and urged the ABA not to consider wasting government money and resources on regulatory bids that simply could not work.<br>It also took the ABA to task for trying to make the Net a children's medium. The WAIA submission made it clear that it supported existing legislation which had already been responsible for prosecutions against child pornographers.<br>The ABA's contention in its issues paper that no child should have an Internet account also counted against regulation. If children were not going to use the Net, except under adult supervision, then it was pointless to regulate against adult freedom of choice.<br>A campaign to ensure Net users made their views known to the ABA submission was begun by Griffin Computers at a World Wide Web site less than a month ago when it was found hardly anyone knew of the ABA inquiry.<br>Since the campaign began interest has leapt.<br></font></p>
