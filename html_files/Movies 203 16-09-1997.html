            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The latest Disney animated feature, Hercules, starts in Perth on Thursday. It is fast and funny . . . and wildly inaccurate. The comic distortion of the ancient Greek myth has angered the Greek Government which has accused the film's creators of trivialising and distorting the country's history.<br>Athens has gone so far as to reject a request to hold a lavish premiere of the film on the Pnyx hill, a ?holy site? of ancient Greece. The question is: Can a myth, which by its nature bends the truth, have its truth bent?<br>Netizens can judge for themselves by bathing in the wealth of ancient myths available on the Web.<br>As good a place to start as any is the Encyclopedia Britannica Online which offers a trial search of its database which enables users to skim the surface of knowledge. Subscribers who pay about $200 a year get a lot more. The first thing Brittanica reveals is that the Greek hero's name is actually Heracles (or Herakles).<br>The Romans borrowed much of Greek mythology and made him Hercules. Along the way, they turned Zeus into Jupiter, Hera (Zeus's wife) into Juno, Hermes into Mercury and so on.<br>Herakles was the product of a union between Zeus and a mortal woman. He was meant to join the gods on Mount Olympus, but was cheated of his heritage by the scheming Hera. He then had to perform 12 stupendous feats to become a god.Disney tells it differently. The film Hercules is the bonny, brawny bouncing boy of a loving Hera. He is stolen away and becomes a Michael Jordan-type superstar with sandals and drinks named after him. One site which sheds light on the subject - and on Greek myths in all their glory - is the Greek Myth Chart which lists all the well-known gods of Olympus alongside their Roman counterparts. Click on a god and you get a potted history. Other links take you to background histories on the myths.<br>More serious mythical reading can be done at The Internet Classics Archive which has full versions of both the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer, in which tales of Herakles abound.<br>Bibliomania is another very literate site. It does not have Homer but it does have the comprehensive Brewer Dictionary of Phrase and Fable which has plenty on Hercules/Herakles.<br>If you are a Disney fan, its official Hercules site matches the film for fun with video clips and wildly inaccurate biographies of the cast of gods and mortals.<br>HELP DESK<br>Britannica: www.eb.com<br>Greek Myth Chart: messagenet.com/myths/names.html<br>Internet Classics Archive: webatomics.com/Classics/<br>Brewer Dictionary: www.bibliomania.com/<br>Reference/PhraseAndFable/<br>Disney's Hercules site: www.disney.com/Hercules/<br></font></p>
