            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LET'S talk about sex today. It was discovered a very long time ago yet each generation of 16-to-19-year-olds seems to find it incomprehensible that members of older generations did it, even though the proof was in the pudding club ... so to speak.<br>My generation of 40-somethings often learnt the facts of life in a car at secluded parking spots. One thing led to another and pretty soon the horn was honking, courtesy of wayward arms and legs, and there were footprints on the ceiling very hard to explain to car-proud fathers.<br>The late Harry Chapin touched on this in his greatest hit, Taxi: ?We learnt about love in the back of a Dodge; the lesson hadn't come too far.?<br>Now I have no idea whether today's young things learn about love in the back of a Holden Barina (a big ask), or a Landcruiser (those rich kids get it easy). But before they borrow the family car for a night out they might like to read the following list of laws still on the statute books in the US.<br>A correspondent in Nova Scotia, Canada, sent them to me and swears she did not make them up. Very quickly you will see it is not only back-seat love that can be hazardous.<br>For example: It's safe to make love while parked in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Police officers aren't allowed to walk up and knock on the window. Any suspicious officer who thinks that sex is taking place must drive up from behind, honk his horn three times and wait two minutes before getting out of his car to investigate.<br>If the horn honks while lovers are coupling in a car in Liberty Corner, New Jersey, the offending parties can be jailed.<br>In Carlsbad, New Mexico, it's legal for couples to have sex in a parked vehicle during their lunch break from work, as long as the car or van has drawn curtains to stop strangers from peeking in.<br>No woman may have sex with a man while riding in an ambulance within the boundaries of Tremonton, Utah. If caught, the woman can be charged with a sexual misdemeanour and her name will be published in the local newspaper. The man gets off.<br>IN OBLONG, Illinois, it's punishable by law to make love while hunting or fishing on your wedding day. No man is allowed to make love to his wife with the smell of garlic, onions or sardines on his breath in Alexandria, Minnesota.<br>Bozeman, Montana, has a law that bans all sexual activity between members of the opposite sex in the front yard of a home after sundown, if they're nude. (Observant readers would have spotted the loopholes. If you wear socks, you can go for it. Also if you're the same sex, the constraints don't seem to apply).<br>An ordinance in Newcastle, Wyoming, specifically bans couples from having sex while standing inside a shop's walk-in meat freezer. (They haven't heard of the cold shoulder).<br>In Helena, Montana, a woman can't dance on a table in a pub unless she has on clothing weighing at least a kilogram. (There is said to be fierce competition for the job of weighing the clothing).<br>In Florida, single, divorced or widowed women, can't parachute on Sunday afternoons.<br>And lastly, women aren't allowed to wear patent-leather shoes in Cleveland, Ohio, in case a man might see the reflection of her undies. (Very wise too. Boys of all ages try this on all the time.)<br>???<br>WISE SAYINGS: I recently came across these while rummaging around in my head. They come from a variety of different sources who shall remain nameless.<br>?Don't be so open-minded, your brains will fall out.<br>?Diplomacy is the art of saying ?nice doggie? until you can find a rock.<br>?Diplomacy is also the art of letting someone have your way.<br>?If one synchronised swimmer drowns, do the rest have to drown too?<br>?It's not hard to meet expenses, they're everywhere.<br>And this one is for Peter Costello: Budget: A way to go broke methodically.<br></font></p>
