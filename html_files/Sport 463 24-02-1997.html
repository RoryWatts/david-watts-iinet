            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DARE we say it - it's on again.<br>Channel 7 kicked off more than six months of AFL action on Friday night with the pre-season Ansett Cup match between Adelaide and Collingwood.<br>But pre-season coverage is really a false start to the most intensive, thrill-filled game TV viewers can comfort themselves with during winter.<br>Many genuine sports lovers, and that includes rabid footy fans, cannot countenance AFL coverage until after the Sheffield Shield cricket final.<br>Seven's AFL talking head Sandy Roberts obviously can't wait for the season proper. His introduction to Friday night's opener was straight from the Bill Lawry school of blathering over-excitement.<br>It added nothing. Honestly, the game can speak for itself without the imposition of overheated commentary that could just as easily come from the grandstand.<br>I don't think the Ansett Cup can tell us much about the coming season. Suffice to say Adelaide has changed its playing style for the better, opting under coach Malcolm Blight for direct football rather than passages of attractive but often meaningless handball.<br>The Crows used only 55 handballs to defeat Collingwood. Last season they averaged 100 or more a match.<br>Perth sporting team supporters had a fairly wretched weekend with the West Coast Eagles and the Perth Glory suffering dreadful drubbings over east. It did not matter that much for the Eagles, taken apart by Geelong in the Ansett Cup match at Waverley.<br>But the Glory looked ordinary as lowly Canberra Cosmos thrashed them 4-1 at Bruce Stadium, Canberra.<br>Actually it is hard to say from TV coverage whether Glory was dreadful or Cosmos brilliant. SBS showed only a minute of highlights yesterday, preferring to cover South Melbourne's controversial win against Brisbane Strikers in the excellent On the Ball show.<br>Soccer and SBS combined to rob me of a traditional Saturday afternoon kip. Feeling relaxed from watching the ABC's worthy coverage of the Cannon Challenge golf tournament, I flicked to SBS as I prepared for some shut-eye.<br>But the World Soccer show had a brilliant match from Argentina between River Plate and Racing (pronounced Rasseen). In the first half alone, River's goalie was sent off for deliberate handball outside his area, a River player was taken off by stretcher in agony after a vigorous challenge, and Racing had a clear goal disallowed.<br>As the 60,000 crowd let off flares and smoke bombs, 10 or more players at a time surrounded the referee after even minor decisions and the acting after tackles came straight from the land of soap operas.<br>River won, even after a second player was sent off. Overall I saw more dives than at the Atlanta pool last year - it was memorable stuff.<br>Another sporting highlight of the weekend was Channel 10's Major League Baseball Unbelievable Great Plays.<br>It focused on the great catches and featured an excellent insightful segment where a Cleveland Indians third baseman described the difficulties in catching fouls as they headed over TV cameras, rails and mounds into the crowd.<br>All this was accompanied by shots of fielders leaping into the front seats to pluck the ball away from often hostile spectators.<br>Cricketers have it easy, even without a mitt.<br></font></p>
