            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SURVEYS have a way of stating the bleeding obvious. Pick up any popular magazine, particularly those that target GYMs (gorgeous young mums) and you will find plenty of evidence.<br>It goes along these lines: ?Latest surveys in the US show that people who eat more are fatter than those who do not.?<br>This sort of shock-horror can pave the way for weeks of survey-related diet stories in which readers are told: ?Eat less and you will lose weight.?<br>Similarly, a survey could find that people who don't wear sunscreen at noon on a summer's day in Perth are more likely to suffer sunburn than those who do.<br>Or, people who drink 12 glasses of beer and smoke 30 cigarettes in two hours at the pub on a Friday night are more inclined to be sick in the morning than a Tibetan monk on a retreat.<br>This week I read a survey in the Melbourne Age about blokes. Researchers at A.C. Nielsen McNair talked to more than 1000 Melbourne men.<br>One area covered was conversation. The Age reported: ?Women are supposed to be good at this, men hopeless. Our survey results seem to support this: ask men about the most common topic of conversation with their male friends and sport is the knock-out winner, followed by work.<br>?. . . personal problems, well men don't seem to have any.?<br>Then followed some interviews about this finding with psycho-babble merchants like professors and psychologists who opined that blokes chose to talk about sport because ?(they) are doing something very subtle . . . It is their "social lubricant' a kind of "sports chatter' that can open a path for deeper intimacies?.<br>Another said sport was tied to notions of masculinity. It conjured images of being tough and courageous, disciplined and committed. ?It has a blokey, boisterous energy, passion and emotion that we often don't give to our emotional life.?<br>This survey, then, is a work of sheer genius. I wonder, if blokes are happiest talking about sport, how the subject of answering a survey was broached by the research person.<br>Presumably he or she bailed up some poor unsuspecting bloke in a pub with the line: ?What about Peter Matera? Reckon he'll go to the Dees? And by the way what do you talk about most? Is it a) the wife and kids; b) your vegie garden; c) the translation of the French literary notion of serie-noir into the more populist film-noir; d) the line of succession to the British throne, or e) footy??<br>Much of this button-holing is not even that necessary. The gentle art of eavesdropping, er I mean observation, would have revealed similar findings without the need for exhaustive interrogation.<br>For example research persons could have spent a day in a coffee shop ?accidentally? over-hearing conversations between GYMs.<br>I am sure they would have found the following fairly typical:<br>GYM 1: Daarling, ooh I do like your new hairdo. It does so much for your eyes, and goes well with the new shoes. Where did you buy them?<br>GYM 2: At Leonard's in Subi; you know where that guy massages your toes when he fits shoes. I do wish my Jim would do that. Our life has become so predictable, and little Skye is growing up so fast.<br>GYM 1: Do you mean the Leonard who's having it off with Trina? Wow, I'd like him to massage my toes. That Trina, all the luck, but it's how society changes . . .<br>When the GYMs come up for air, the researcher could note: women talk about anything and everything.<br>The next day could be spent at a pub observing two blokes. It could well go like this:<br>BLOKE 1: Maaate.<br>BLOKE 2: Maate. New haircut?<br>BLOKE 1: Yeah. Beer?<br>BLOKE 2: Maaaate. Justin Langer, hey?<br>And thus, very quickly, the researcher would note: Blokes like to talk about sport.<br>I wonder what other surveys are up the sleeves of the trend-watchers? How about ?Do cats drive dogs mad?? or ?Do children like sweets?? or even ?Do people enjoy paying bank fees??<br>Time to go. Next week: Can the Spice Girls sing?<br></font></p>
