            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BILL GATES has plenty of enemies waiting to see him and his dominant Microsoft fall from grace.<br>The recent revelation that Mr Gates would not seek to make Microsoft Explorer the standard browser for World Wide Web pages on the Internet was a rare admission that Microsoft can't have everything.<br>Critics had maligned Explorer as a bid by Mr Gates to plug more users into Windows 95, which offers its users an Internet connection through Explorer.<br>But the people spoke and what they said was not Explorer, but Netscape and Java, music to the ears of Mr Gates' vocal opponents at Sun Microsystems and Netscape's inventor Marc Andreessen.<br>Sun believes Mr Gates' era is almost over. In an article in Forbes magazine in August, George Gilder quoted Sun executives as saying that new Net software, such as Java, would allow PC and Mac users to forget the limitations of their hard drives and the programs on them - mostly Microsoft's.<br>Java is a script, already incorporated into the beta version of Netscape 2, that allows fluid interactivity on the Web.<br>Programs, videos, audio can jump to life from another screen across the world when detonated by Java.<br>Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun, criticises Mr Gates for making software more clumsy so that it gobbles up the ever-expanding capacity of microchips.<br>?Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal and other programming languages, has propounded two new Parkinson's Laws for software: "Software expands to fill the available memory,' and "Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware gets faster',? Mr Joy says.<br>?Indeed, newer programs seem to run more slowly on most systems than their previous releases.<br>?But none of this matters. Mr Gates has moved from triumph to triumph by shrewdly exploiting the advances of microcosmic hardware. With Moore's Law and the Law of the Microcosm, the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months, and cost/performance rises as the square of the number of transistors.<br>?The complexity sinks into the microcosm and power rises exponentially on the chip to absorb all the complexity grenades rolling down from Redmond,? Mr Joy says.<br>Now Mr Gates is making more enemies with his book The Road Ahead. Some knockers - and there are many (just type Bill Gates into Yahoo or Lycos search engines) - even claim a committee of three wrote the book and damn it for robotic prose.<br>David Rothman, author of Networld, a view of information technology and people, is particularly harsh on Mr Gates.<br>?At $13 billion, Gates is worth three times the book royalties paid to all writers each year in the United States. We're talking banana republic here.<br>?I'm not calling for confiscation of his wealth - just an information system fairer to non-billionaires, be they writers or schoolchildren,? he writes in an acidic Web page.<br>?The Road Ahead is a hardback ad and CD-ROM promo about Microsoft's role on the information superhighway. Bill Gates smiles and boasts a lot. In places, this is capitalism's answer to Soviet films about happy workers and tractors.<br>?Me, I'm out to tell what's happening on the Internet right now before the big boys can elbow aside the small guys. In fact, my subtitle is What People Are Really Doing on the Internet - and What It Means to You.?<br>Mr Rothman was particularly angry at Mr Gates' million dollar advance and the fact that he got on the cover of Newsweek, promoting the book.<br>The tall poppy syndrome is not just Australian. Americans, with more liberal libel laws, pursue their poppies with vigour and venom.<br>And Mr Gates is about the tallest poppy there is.<br></font></p>
