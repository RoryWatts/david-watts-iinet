            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FRIDAY is D-Day for people interested in the future of the Internet in Australia.<br>It is the deadline for public submissions to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's inquiry into online services, chief of which is the Net.<br>The inquiry has been sparked by growing community concerns about the availability and easy access to harmful material such as child pornography on the Net.<br>Many users have rallied in the past fortnight to raise the awareness of others about the inquiry deadline. Strong fears are held that without user input the inquiry, called by Federal Telecommunications Minister Michael Lee, could recommend draconian restrictions.<br>The call for public submissions was made five months ago, but according to pages on the World Wide Web put up by concerned users, the details were advertised only in the Australian and Financial Review newspapers.<br>The main complaint was that the call for submissions was not even made to newsgroups.<br>One Net user likened this to the plot of Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy in which aliens bulldoze Earth for a hyperspace bypass and surviving earthlings are told the plans have been on display ... in another galaxy, but on display.<br>The ABA advertisement for submissions said, in part: ?Technical and industry responses on any aspect of the investigation are also welcomed, and the ABA encourages members of the public, including users of online services, to comment on the paper.?<br>But up to a fortnight ago there had been only two public submissions to the probe, according to Web pages. Since then, with repeated mailings to newsgroups, there has been a steady flow of submissions, some from overseas.<br>The overwhelming fear of Net users is that the Australian operations will fall under government control, no matter who wins on March 2, restricting the present, almost untrammelled, freedom of users to see, hear and write what they like.<br>The general tone of submissions made in the past fortnight is that Net users will self-regulate.<br>There is genuine concern about pornographic and violent material, but this also appears to be governable by self-regulation rather than penalty.<br>Last week the US Government passed legislation considered by Net users to be repressive in a bid to crack down on harmful material and appease community concerns.<br>A US citizen says in a submission to the ABA probe: ?I am a US citizen who is horrified at the recent passage, in my country, of the Communications Decency Act.<br>?This repressive act even makes illegal the discussion of so vital a medical topic as abortion. In other words, e-mail communiques between physician and patient discussing abortion for whatever reasons, makes those two persons subject to fines and/or imprisonment.<br>?This is an example of how bad it can get, and so I write to you in hope that you too will see how ludicrous censorship of any sort can be.?<br>The writer asked to be considered a citizen of the Internet because she disavowed US citizenship after the Act's passage.<br>URL: http://www.iinet.net.au/~griffin/<br>The Final Countdown ... has details of the inquiry, how to make submissions, full reports from the ABA and terms of reference for the inquiry.<br></font></p>
