            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The World Wide Web is becoming so big that it is often hard to know where to start. US company Bigfoot Partners has tried to simplify the average surfing session with the release of the Neoplanet browser. It is not strictly a browser in the Navigator-Internet Explorer mould, however. For a start it requires only a 400K download and installs rapidly. Neoplanet is actually a browser plug-in which adds a simple frame to your default browser window and throws a pane of "channels' down the right side of the screen.<br>These channels are not the infuriating type that Microsoft and Netscape have been pushing users toward all year. They are collections of URLs grouped by topic.<br>Thus they are not as pretty as push channels. But they do work because they are good, old normal Web pages.<br>Bigfoot has followed the basic rule of the Net ? KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).<br>You don't have to just follow Neoplanet's channels and be caught in the overly-American influence of the sites chosen. Each category can be configured to include your own URLs and one of the categories holds your Favourites (in MSIE). At the moment Neoplanet will work only with MSIE, but a Netscape version is coming soon.<br>The more than 20 categories or Channels include Sport, Money, Movies/TV, Travel, Music, News, Cars and Kids.Pages under the categories are mostly of the big and old favourite type. The Movies/TV category, for example, includes Mr Showbiz, the Internet Movie DataBase and Film.Com.<br>Clicking on a category takes you straight to the first site listed. Initially this can be frustrating, but easy customisation allows you to place a site of your choice as first pick.One of the big pluses with the MSIE version is the full-screen browser. This gives even more space than MSIE's excellent facility. The only intrusion is a narrow pane on the right with a few icons for browsing back and forth or unzooming to a normal screen.<br>Neoplanet's easy interface addresses a problem brought on by the browser war between Microsoft and Netscape, according to Melissa Bane, a senior analyst with the Yankee Group. ?Browsers have become a forum for Microsoft and Netscape to introduce new technologies whether the market is calling for them or not,? she said.Explorer and Navigator were becoming more bloated and complicated.This allowed Bigfoot to find a spot within both browsers to make the Web simpler. The software works on Windows 95 and Windows 3.1. Mac versions are due out in the first half of next year.<br>Help DeskNeoplanet browser<br>www.neoplanet.com<br>THE LABNeoplanet Browser<br>Format: Win95 browser plug-in (Win3.1 and Mac versions to follow)<br>Developer/distributor: Bigfoot Partners<br>Freeware<br></font></p>
