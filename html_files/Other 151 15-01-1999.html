            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FORGET the belltower Mr Court. You might have succumbed slightly to public opposition to your vision of 80 thrusting metres of glass and steel ringing in 2000. But it is still not enough.<br>It is getting a bit late to build whatever you eventually come up with by December 31 anyway. Try something simpler, yet with more universal appeal.<br>Earlier this week I was struck by inspiration for your wish to give Perth its own Statue of Liberty, an Eiffel Tower-on-Swan, even a Sandgroper Opera House.<br>I was watching the tennis on the telly. All right I was watching Anna Kournikova, the Russian teen queen pouting her way to victory.<br>Actually I am not that enamoured of Ms Kournikova, who, to put it bluntly, is just a girl, and one who looks like she could be the love child of Boris Yeltsin to boot.<br>But that is purely personal and certainly a view not shared by the big crowd of blokes who thronged centre court to watch this siren.<br>So, more specifically, I was watching the crowd watching Anna Kournikova at White City. It was a revealing show of testosterone. Every time Ms Kournikova bent over in her tight-fitting tennis dress, hundreds of pairs of male eyes would follow her.<br>Cameras clicked from every vantage. One man who looked old enough to know better was shown on TV snapping away at the Russian. He took the camera away from his face, and the woman beside him gave him an almighty dig in the ribs with her elbow. I assumed it was his wife.<br>What the crowd did not do was look up every five seconds to check their images on a giant video replay screen.<br>There appears to be no call for giant video replay screens at tennis. The arguments over line calls would surely take over the game if courts were equipped like football or cricket venues.<br>Thus the crowd - although obviously satisfied by its immature perving at Ms Kournikova - was missing one of the great things about sport in Australia: the giant video replay.<br>As TV cricket viewers are aware, no one at the ground watches the game any more. They watch the screen. The game is so much more revealing and exciting when slowed down repeatedly from half a dozen angles.<br>And, much more importantly, any boofhead can win instant fame by getting his face on screen.<br>This is the point Mr Court. Perth does not need a belltower. It needs a really, really, really big giant video replay screen.<br>Put it in Barrack Square by all means, but rest assured it could also tour the State on the back of a really, really, really big truck.<br>That way, every person in WA could be on TV and famous for a few minutes.<br>Can you assure them that a tinkle of bells will make them feel as good as seeing themselves poke funny faces on a giant video replay screen?<br>Another good thing - as with a super slo-mo of a Jeff Farmer speccy, or a Stuart MacGill wrong "un - is that you could present calming images to the populace when times are bad.<br>Say your government has just closed another school. You could tow the giant replay screen to the affected area and play restful scenes of Elle Macpherson strolling along Cable Beach; or John Worsfold and Mick Malthouse holding the AFL premiership trophy aloft, or even Anna Kournikova bending over.<br>The possibilities are limitless.<br>You might even have a soundtrack of bells.<br>And you should always leave plenty of chances for the people to wave at the camera too.<br>The reality, Mr Court, is that there should be no reality in the next millennium. Strike now.<br>You can mail the six-figure consultancy fee to me, care of this office.<br></font></p>
