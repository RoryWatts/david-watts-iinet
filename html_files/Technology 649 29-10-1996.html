            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO nations stop next Tuesday - Australia for a horse race and the US to elect the leader of the free world.<br>The Melbourne Cup has the power to quieten the heart of cities but has yet to make much of an impact on the World Wide Web.<br>WestWeb has tried in vain for a week to find a list of all Cup winners since Archer's inaugural victory in 1861. But it does not appear to be among the myriad of punting, breeding, race club and thoroughbred links unearthed.<br>But there are betting systems out there designed to give punters, professional and mug alike, a Cup tip.<br>The most fascinating is by Max Hitchins, a marketing man, who in his own words is not a professional tipster and who rarely goes to the races.<br>However, his Cup site, Fact, Fiction and Fables of the Melbourne Cup, presents a system to pick the Cup winner that has proved quite effective despite its reliance on what can only be called weird science.<br>Mr Hitchins relies on the winner of the race 100 years ago to give a hint for success. Thus for 1990 he went back to 1890 when the great Carbine won the Cup.<br>Carbine was called King of the Cup and in 1990 there was an entrant called Kingston Rule ... he picked it and it won.<br>There are more, similar stories at his site as well as fascinating excerpts of Cup trivia from his book which bears the same title as the Web page.<br>On a more serious note for punters are the directories of HorseNET, which allow e-mail discussions of Cup fancies.<br>All Cup-related sites listed here have dozens of links to other horse racing sites, including TABs and online tipping services.<br>The US presidential race would appear to be a one-horse race. Few pundits are giving Republican hopeful Bob Dole much of a chance against incumbent Bill Clinton.<br>But there are hundreds of Web resources where opinions differ and many sides of the presidential campaign are discussed.<br>For sheer authority, the Encyclopedia Britannica's American Presidential Election page is hard to go past.<br>Britannica has used its considerable and famous resources to bring biographies of all presidents and vice-presidents, explanations of the electoral process and memorabilia through the years.<br>It also links to some good, serious resources like the Papers of George Washington site, Abraham Lincoln Online and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum.<br>The Skeleton Closet pushes libel laws to the extreme with no-holds-barred looks at candidates' peccadilloes.<br>URLs<br>Australian Horse Information Services - www.horsenet.com.au/melbcup.htm<br>Fact, Fiction and Fables of the Melbourne Cup - www.hitchins.com.au<br>Flemington Racecourse - www.ozracing.net.au/flemcors.htm<br>Victoria Racing Club - www.ozracing.net.au/vrcmain.htm<br>?hat's?
