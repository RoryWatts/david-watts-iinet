            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MORE women are surfing the World Wide Web, according to several of the latest Internet surveys.<br>The Georgia Tech GVU survey found there were 30 per cent earlier this year compared with just over 10 per cent two years ago. America Online says the figure has grown to more than 40 per cent.<br>Two widely different new guides to the Net especially for women have emerged because of this growth.<br>Australia's peak user body, Electronic Frontiers Australia, has set up a Web site specifically for women called the EFA-women mailing lists FAQ.<br>It introduces two EFA women's mailing lists - efa.women.issues and efa.women.learning - and allows users to subscribe to them to take part in discussions of women's issues.<br>The site has links to many sites including education about the Net, fun sites, anti-censorship resources, electronic magazines, women's organisations on the Web, Australian rural women, resources for women and technical information.<br>Far different, but no less helpful, is Net Chick, a site maintained by self-confessed cyberbabe Carla (her only name) in San Francisco.<br>Net Chick is presented in fairly outrageous style and in the 1990s language of the ?babe?, typified by coolness and a no-holds barred approach to the language.<br></font></p>
