            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">In its simplest terms, the US Department of Justice's suit against Microsoft boils down to a requirement that the Windows operating system include copies of rival Internet browser, Netscape.<br>The immediate response of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates last Tuesday was that this was like Coca-Cola being forced to include three cans of Pepsi in every six-pack.<br>Within hours several commentators countered that Coke does not own 90 per cent of the world's supermarket shelves to display its product.<br>So by Thursday night, Mr Gates, in a Wall Street Journal article, had changed the analogy. ?It's like ordering Ford to sell autos fitted with Chrysler engines,? he wrote.<br>All of which is clever, but the Netscape issue is really only the simplest part of a complicated process that could determine the future of computing.<br>The US Government's use of the Sherman Act against Microsoft has an interesting precedent.<br>Ninety years ago president Theodore Roosevelt launched a similar assault on the world's first billionaire, John D Rockefeller, who, as founder of Standard Oil, controlled 80 per cent of US petroleum output.<br>Mr Roosevelt and his trust-busters in the US Justice Department pursued their quarry so relentlessly that Standard was broken into smaller companies.<br>Petrol was the currency of progress in the early part of the century; just as computerised information is the currency of progress at the fag end. Mr Roosevelt's win against Mr Rockefeller did not stifle American enterprise or innovation nor hurt the economy. Indeed US petroleum companies dominate the global industry.<br>The irony of the US Government's intervention is that in the land of free enterprise a government has to act like a socialist regime and regulate the economy to ensure a level playing field.<br>Just as ironic is Mr Gates's claim that his monopolistic company is a bastion of the free enterprise system that has, in parts, rallied against him to try to stop him controlling the information age.<br>To try to put in context what is rapidly becoming a clear-as-mud issue, we should briefly look at the possible outcomes:<br>If the DOJ prevails: Microsoft could be broken into at least two companies, one selling operating systems such as Windows98 and one selling applications such as Word and Internet Explorer.<br>Computer makers such as Compaq or Dell will be able to offer a choice of operating systems - Linux, OS2, Windows etc - to buyers.<br>Netscape's release of the source code for Communicator might allow an innovative software developer to write a new operating system, that in tandem with the ability of Java, allows every computer in the world to speak the same language. The winners would arguably be the users.<br>If Microsoft prevails: New computers will come in one flavour, Windows. But everything that Microsoft believes its customers want will be bundled into it - voice recognition, TV, etc.<br>The Explorer browser interface will not change greatly over the years because of a lack of pressure from rival browser manufacturers which will have gone out of business.<br>Internet users will have access to a wide world of commerce, controlled by Microsoft or companies who have paid to be affiliated with it. All computers will speak the same language.<br>The winner is Microsoft, and the bevy of lawyers hired to protect it.<br>It is all enough to make you want to buy an Apple Mac.<br>HELP DESK<br>DOJ suit: www.news.com/Pages/Special/<br>dojcomplaint.html<br>Bill Gates article: www.microsoft.com/<br>corpinfo/doj/5-20wsjoped.htm<br></font></p>
