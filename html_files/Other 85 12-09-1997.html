            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE CAN learn a lot of things from dogs. One of the most obvious is to go to the toilet before taking a walk. But I would caution against sniffing the bottoms of total strangers.<br>I spend a lot of time with my dog, a cavalier king charles spaniel - this is a big, fancy name for a silly but loveable ball of fluff. We are left with each other most days because my GYM (gorgeous young mum) of a wife is a busy person and I choose to work from home.<br>Thus we - the dog and I, but I would also like to think the GYM and I - have struck up a rapport. Unfortunately it does not include many more spoken words than ?sit?, ?quiet? and ?oh, no, not that rug again? (I repeat, the dog not the GYM).<br>If he could talk, I wonder what my dog would say. Let's say we are out on a walk around the leafy suburb, it could go something like this:<br>Me: Dog, what do you make of Earl Spencer's speech?<br>Dog: Ruff . . . that's a nice tree.<br>Me: I told you to go before we left. Now what do you think of Pauline Hanson?<br>Dog: Whimper . . . oh, a pole, I like that; wouldn't touch Pauline with it though.<br>Me: What about the Bulldogs?<br>Dog: As an actual canine species, they are true gentlemen; as a footy team, they are bits of mongrels and scrappers. But they might win and make us all look like . . . oh, a pussycat.<br>As you can see these conversations would have potential but be awfully prone to distraction.<br>Through the wonders of modern science I communicate with a group of people on the Internet called the Fogies. We allegedly have some things in common like wrinkles and the inability to program VCRs. Some of us also seem to have in common a liking for dogs.<br>Recently one of the group who goes by the very un-doggy name of Garfield sent around a list of things dogs can teach us. I found it most edifying. I hope you do too.<br>Lessons from dogs:<br>© Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joy ride.<br>© Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy.<br>© When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.<br>© When it's in your best interest, practise obedience.<br>© Let others know when they've invaded your territory.<br>© Take naps and stretch before rising.<br>© Run, romp and play daily.<br>© Eat with gusto and enthusiasm.<br>© Be loyal.<br>© Never pretend to be something you're not.<br>© If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.<br>© When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle him or her gently.<br>© Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.<br>© When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.<br>© Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.<br>o o oHOW about a joke? We haven't had one for a few weeks and in light of recent tragedies I think we all could do with some relief.<br>An aardvark goes into a pub. The barman runs to the boss and says: ?There's an aardvark out there, what should I do?? The boss says: ?Aardvarks are really stupid. Charge him lots of money for anything he orders.? The barman returns to the counter, where the aardvark orders a beer. The barman gets it for him and charges him $40.<br>The aardvark is sipping his beer and the barman, overcome by curiosity, says: ?You know, we don't get many aardvarks in here.?<br>The aardvark replies: ?Well, at 40 bucks a beer I can see why.?<br>Next week we'll look at things that can put blokes in the doghouse.<br></font></p>
