            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 7 has its work cut out satisfying the hundreds of thousands of West Australians who watch AFL games on TV at the weekend.<br>Two weeks ago this column put forward seven areas in which Seven's coverage could be improved and asked readers for their opinion.<br>Letters and e-mails mostly covered the seven points, but dragged in state of origin football, the Eagles' propensity for playing via the boundary, a perceived need for more news about Collingwood, Essendon's dream run of games at the MCG, and the lack of toilets and good seating at Subiaco Oval.<br>One cheeky e-mailer even suggested his dog knew more about football than me.<br>To which the answer has to be: almost certainly, particularly if it is a bulldog with a flat nose that goes ?mark, mark?.<br>But seriously, the seven discussion points were:<br>? Unearth new commentary talent.<br>?Cut the number of commentators at each game.<br>?Get rid of the fourth umpire.<br>?Make boundary riders neutral.<br>?Go easy on the ads.<br>?Be judicious with slow-motion replays.<br>?Stick to football; don't try to compete with Sam Newman.<br>About 90 per cent of the mail agreed in general with these points with the common theme ?you've hit the nail on the head?.<br>But how to go about making improvements led to a variety of opinions.<br>Significantly, four or five readers suggested Seven should seek more biased commentary to give the calling more of an edge.<br>One called for the return of Don Scott, the former Hawthorn ruckman who always seemed to ruffle the feathers of Eagles' supporters.<br>?For all his faults he was knowledgeable and passionate. And I miss hearing him and Dennis (Cometti) at each other,? the letter said.<br>On the subject of bias, another wrote: ?It would be great to have a one-eyed Eagles or Docker commentator adding his two bob's worth to the commentary as he would be merely publicly voicing the opinion of 99 per cent of the WA viewers.<br>?This should help people suffering from high blood pressure and/or weak hearts from doing themselves an injury when an obviously missed decision in favour of the WA side or an incorrect decision has been given against the WA side is vindicated by the commentator.?<br>Another view on bias was that Seven's men needed to learn from BBC soccer callers how to be objective.<br>?BBC soccer commentaries give great credit to all participants, without bias.?<br>Criticism of the need for fourth umpire John Russo was widespread, as was the hatred of too many advertisements, particularly between goals during a replayed game.<br>Live and Kicking - Seven's attempt to take on Sam Newman and the Footy Show - received about 50 per cent support. Its adherents said they preferred it because it was more a family show.<br>Newman and company copped flak for being too smutty and for degrading footballers.<br>But the same crew also had plenty of support for injecting a level of fun into football that Seven could not match.<br>The bottom line ... it takes all types.<br></font></p>
