            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">There is nothing wrong with Windows 3.1. I have been known to ask people using it: ?Where's the chimney?? But that is just the smug arrogance of a fairly happy Win95 hack.<br>It wasn't always thus. Until I upgraded from a 486 with 8Mb of RAM to a Pentium 133 with 24Mb, I was often a miserable little sod haunted by blue warning windows and constant crashes.<br>Then I used to dream of 3.1 and actually re-installed it at least twice after formatting 95 out of my life . . . temporarily. Pretty soon the desire to have a Start button, a recent documents list, far more flexible interface and mostly faster operations, forced me to reach for the envelope and put the 95 CD back in the drive. Once I got the power right, I did not look back. But 3.1 still has a certain appeal. I use it on computers away from the home desktop at least twice a week. Lately I've been carting around a laptop and it steams away merrily with 3.11 (Windows for Workgroups).<br>If you haven't used 95 on a powerful enough platform, there seems little reason to fork out hard cash for it - and the hardware upgrades often required - just to join the growing majority. In late 1994, Microsoft claimed 50 million people worldwide used Windows 3.x, a figure that had doubled every few months since the release of Windows 3.0 in 1990.<br>Since the release of 95 two years ago, new and ever powerful PCs have had it as the default. Nearly half the 20,000 respondents to Georgia Tech's comprehensive online survey in April said they used 95. About 11 per cent used 3.1. With NT use growing, the total number of Windows users was more than 65 per cent. Macs accounted for just over 25 per cent.<br>Two years earlier, before 95's release, total Windows use - and that was almost exclusively 3.1 - was 61 per cent. Interestingly, Mac use was at the same 25 per cent.<br>But 3.1's days are numbered. Next year we will see Windows 98, the last platform on which Microsoft will allow 16-bit operations. Windows 3.1 users will be able to upgrade directly to it if they have Pentiums and 16Mb of RAM.<br>The American PC User magazine reported last month that MS is due to stop selling 3.1 this quarter but will continue to support it - which, of course, it must because of the huge number of users, many of them in big offices.<br>MS has also decided to delay release of 98 until the second quarter of next year, according to industry reports. The software giant says it wants to release the new platform for both 95 and 3.1 upgrades simultaneously. The alternative was to release 98 for 95 users first, then release it for 3.1 users some months later.<br>Cynics at ZDNet, a big industry commentator, say MS could not get the software right for a Christmas release and that an immediate post-Christmas sale would have been unwise commercially. Basically, the retailers would not have been happy trying to flog the new OS in the low season, and only to 95 users. It made economic sense to launch mid-year to both 95 and 3.1 users.<br>So, even with a cynical view, 3.1 users still have some clout. All good things will come to an end possibly early next century. Until then, it is fascinating to look at just how little computing power is needed to run 3.1.
