            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE start of a new year seems the perfect time to make a fresh start.<br>That is precisely what I am doing. As you read this, I have abandoned my PC, my Net connection, my bookmarks, my FTP, my Web site, my TV and my phone to rough it on Rottnest sans technology.<br>A fresh start is needed. A week without relying on Microsoft and wondering what Windows 98 has done with my settings. The first act is to come clean and eat some humble pie ... all right, grovel.<br>Last week I wrote tongue-in-cheek about the Y2K bug not hitting until 2048 because K was K as in kilobytes and therefore meant 1024 and not 1000.<br>A reader e-mailed me before the ink had dried on his newspaper. Quite correctly he pointed out that Y2K (with a big K) meant 2048, but Y2k (with a little k) was the right way to address the 2000 problem.<br>?I would interpret Y2k to mean Year 2000, because "k' is the suffix for the SI (Systeme International d'Unites) multiple of 1000, as used in scientific and mathematical fields and is where kilogram (1000 grams) comes from,? he wrote.<br>?However, note that it is a lower case "k'. In computing fields the "kilo' prefix means 1024 because this makes more sense in base 2 environment. Usually this "kilo' prefix is displayed as capital "K'.<br>?Mind you, this is a whimsical difference probably caused by aesthetics or my programmers being confused because higher powers of 10 (mega, giga, tera, peta) use capital letters in their suffixes (M, G, T, P respectively). Smaller multiple like hecto, deca, milli use lower case letters (h, da, m, respectively).?<br>?I suggest that if we use Y2k instead of Y2K there can be no confusion.?<br>I would just like to say thanks a million ... but I am not sure of the correct suffix and its use.<br>Grovel number two refers to a column earlier in December where I said I could not find official UK press releases by Prime Minister Tony Blair.<br>T HIS led to a churlish casting of aspersions on the UK's right to be called a democracy.<br>A reader promptly told me how misguided I was and pointed out that the UK has just as open a Web-based press release system as the White House in the US and Prime Minister John Howard here.<br>The URL is in the Help Desk, and you will find the Number 10 Downing Street site a lot more refreshing than the bureaucratically-inclined Central Office of Information.<br>Grovels three and four concern the iMac and AOL which I harangued.<br>My Windows PC on its normal Net connection would not play a particular Macromedia Flash site no matter how many times I installed the plug-in.<br>It worked first time on the little iMac at work, though, then it worked at home through a trial AOL connection, using the Big Brother-like ISP's proprietary browser.<br>Now I am off to play solitaire ... with real cards.<br>HELP DESK<br>Number 10 Downing Street:<br>www.number-10.gov.uk/ index.html<br>iMac: www.apple.com.au<br>AOL: www.aol.com.au<br></font></p>
