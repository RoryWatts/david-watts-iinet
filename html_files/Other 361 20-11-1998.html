            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GARY SPARROW is no Dr Who. But as the time-travelling, two-timing hero of the ABC's Goodnight Sweetheart he seems to have more fun than anyone who played the great Time Lord.<br>But Goodnight Sweetheart has made only a small impression on the Web.<br>This is odd because it deals in the mythology of time travel that fascinates a lot of cyber-chatters.<br>Still, the main Goodnight Sweetheart site has plenty to amuse the devoted fan.<br>The attractively framed site, by British TV Comedy Resources, sums up the show's plot nicely.<br>It contains links to a list of all episodes - West Australians are at the end of the fourth of five (so far) series - plus a quick guide to the goings-on of each episode.<br>You can travel back in time to the first episode made in 1993 and read how Gary happened on the spot in Duckett's Lane which allowed him to travel between the 90s and war-time London.<br>Or, if you do not like suspense, you can read the summaries of the episodes yet to be shown here - they were made earlier this year - and find how Gary has coped with having a pregnant wife in the 90s, and a pregnant girlfriend in the 40s.<br>If you don't want your fun spoiled, you can read about the cast, or tour the links to other comedies like The Good Life, Blackadder and Birds of a Feather.<br>Visit: www.phill.co.uk/<br>comedy/gns/<br>Those with good, fast connections and a little time can download a video clip of part of a yet-to-be-screened episode.<br>Don't look if you are worried it could give the game away in the funny Gary-Yvonne-Phoebe love triangle.<br>Visit:www.pearsontv.com/<br>pages/library/goodnight.htm<br></font></p>
