            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AVERAGE Australians don't have to go very far before they are standing in the shadows cast by Kerry Packer.<br>So it shouldn't have been a surprise last week that Mr Packer's Publishing & Broadcasting had a half interest in developing a marketing information database with information on 15 million of us.<br>PBL has 50 per cent of Axciom, the company that wants to keep tabs on our habits, particularly the spending ones.<br>Online reaction at several newsgroups I habitually eavesdrop on was fairly low key. Most Net users were not surprised that someone wanted to harness all this data for better marketing. They also were not surprised at the involvement of PBL, and by extension Mr Packer, because of that empire's resources and desire for more.<br>Some suggested cynically that such a database would further Americanise us with the ability to turn people into marketing targets.<br>Online reaction from the Packer empire was pretty low key too, despite its rapidly increasing mastery of the medium.<br>Basically it was left to an editorial at the Australian PC Magazine's Newswire site, which is published by PBL.<br>Angus Kidman admitted he could ?hardly be accused of being an unbiased observer?.<br>But he believed that the dual angles of privacy invasion and Kerry Packer made the rest of the media froth at the mouth. ?All kinds of businesses and government bodies make use of this sort of data,? Kidman wrote. ?When I get sent mail by John Howard (my local member) urging me to vote for him in an election, the same basic systems are at work.?<br>What caused this alleged frothing at the mouth, of course, was the sheer size of the enterprise and the power that data on 15 million people gives to an already powerful company in PBL.<br>Information is hard currency more than ever as Australia learns to buy and sell on the Net. And the Packer influence on the Net is getting bigger.<br>Last week, Net research company IMR Worldwide published a list of Australia's top 40 Web sites based on the surfing activities of 3000 people. It showed Ninemsn - the joint venture between Mr Packer's ecorp and Microsoft - with a clear lead.<br>Ninemsn drew 1.6 million users in November. Second-ranked Look-Smart, which has a presence at Ninemsn, was well behind with 507,000 visitors.<br>The Where Did We Go survey site, done as a community service by Tony Webster of Melbourne, appears at first glance to have pricked the Ninemsn bubble.<br>Latest figures show thatwww.cricket.org is the top Australian site and Ninemsn is only fourth.<br>BUT www.cricket.org is the CricInfo site and the most hammered part of that site this summer is the main Australian page, which just happens to also go under the name baggygreen.com.<br>And who have we heard talking up this site recently? None other than the Channel 9 commentary team.<br>The Packet net lurks everywhere. It is little wonder Ninemsn does so well.<br>Surfers can do everything from sending a virtual kiss to reading the latest news to buying a car to subscribing to any number of Packer magazines . . . and on and on.<br>It is becoming a powerful presence in a powerful medium.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
