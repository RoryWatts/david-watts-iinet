            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web is a great place to make a stand.<br>It costs little to learn and compile enough HTML to push your opinions into cyberspace.<br>There are few restrictions about what can be said or who can say it.<br>This results in an amazing diversity of views with the power to entertain and enrich lives.<br>On one hand you could make a stand like Ohio man Jim Kenzig, who is using the Web to tell President Bill Clinton it is time to use the money wasted on the Lewinsky affair for research into finding a cure for diseases killing children.<br>Mr Kenzig lost his 10-year-old daughter Kristen to a rare form of brain tumour last year and he corresponds regularly via e-mail with the parents of children with similar afflictions.<br>And many of them - stirred by Mr Kenzig's stand on the Web - have decided to e-mail Mr Clinton in similar vein.<br>Or consider the case of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. It used its Museum of Human Tolerance Web site last week to host a video-conference at which former Japanese soldiers recounted their role in atrocities committed against Chinese, American and other Allied prisoners of war in China and Manchuria during World War II.<br>A Japanese activist and crusader on behalf of World War II ?comfort women? across Asia also took part in the conference based in Tokyo, but able to seen and heard with the RealPlayer Web tool all around the world.<br>Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia also recently took to the Web in a growing campaign against ill-treatment.<br>The BBC world news site said last week that reports of looting, violence and rape committed against ethnic Chinese during riots in May were originally suppressed by the State media in China, with the authorities concerned it might affect ties with Indonesia and provoke demonstrations.<br>?But pictures, allegedly showing the burnt bodies of women raped and killed in the riots, have been circulating on the World Wide Web and Internet reports on the violence have filtered through to the public,? the BBC reported.<br>Indonesian Web sites have also come under attack from political hackers. The home page of a site at www.bkkbn.go.id was replaced with a message saying ?Warning from Chinese. This page is hacked for your national day. Please keep this page for 48 hours and punish the murderers in May immediately.?<br>Some use of the Web is a lot less high-minded. One suspects there are users who come from the shallow end of the gene pool, as the Footy Show's Sam Newman would say.<br>In fact, it is Australian football where one new site is causing tidal waves of disbelief.<br>Someone - no one has been able to unearth the identity yet - has chosen the sharp end of the football season to set up the Official Anti-AFL Web Site.<br>There is nothing intrinsically wrong with opposition to football. Anti-football movements have existed for years and have been seen as mostly decent and humorous.<br>It is the manner in which the creator of the anti-AFL site has chosen to make a stand that is causing anger.<br>He (it could be she but this seems unlikely) chose to announce that the site existed by posting an e-mail to an Australian football newsgroup.<br>The message was entirely in capital letters (the Net equivalent of shouting) and started with the words: ?YOU STUPID PEOPLE ARE ALL MORONS!!!?<br>It became steadily worse and by Saturday had provoked more than 30 replies mostly wondering about the author's intentions and state of mind.<br>The anti-AFL site itself is a curious piece of work with very little content. It has been described as slow, full of bugs, no news, full of ?pathetic little messages? and containing links with errors.<br>The site's creator did attract some traffic at least, which may have been the intention all the time.<br>HELP DESK<br>Massacre apology webcast:<br>events.broadcast.com/events/swc/<br>nanjingmassacre/<br>BBC news:<br>news.bbc.co.uk/default.htm<br>Official Anti-AFL Web Site:<br>members.tripod.com/~AntiAFL/<br></font></p>
