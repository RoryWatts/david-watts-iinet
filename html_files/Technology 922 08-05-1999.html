            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">But opposition to Web censorship Bill grows online and off<br>COMMUNICATIONS Minister Richard Alston flayed political and online opponents during a vigorous defence of Internet censorship legislation yesterday.<br>In a speech to the Melbourne branch of the Liberal Party, he hit out at Labor Party accusations that the legislation was aimed at winning the vote of Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine.<br>He attacked the Australian Democrats for wanting more relaxed restrictions, saying that the party was out of touch with community concerns.<br>Labor was headline hunting and suggestions the Government was putting political concerns above the interest of protecting children was an insult to Australian parents.<br>Senator Harradine has been an outspoken critic of offensive content on the Net in Senate committees that have examined the medium and community standards during the past three years.<br>Senator Alston's speech was his first public acknowledgement of widespread opposition among the Net community since the legislation was introduced.<br>He said a week after his Bill was announced that the legislation had been welcomed warmly. But free speech campaigners and sectors of the Net industry, particularly Internet service providers, have mounted a sustained campaign against it in that time.<br>More than 10,000 people have signed an online petition on the Web against the legislation. Service providers have turned Web pages black to draw attention to it and protest marches have been organised for this month in Perth, Sydney, Melbourne and other centres.<br>Yesterday, Senator Alston concentrated on three widespread criticisms as well as the accusations concerning Senator Harradine:<br>?He said efforts to compare restrictions on freedom of speech by using the United States as a model were ludicrous.<br>?He denied the Government was imposing technical restrictions on the Net which would slow access speeds and destroy electronic commerce. The Government had not specified that service providers use any particular technology to block and filter content rated X or R by the National Classification Board.<br>?He congratulated the Net industry on working with the Government to try to find a code of practice that would make the Net a safer environment for children.<br>The industry was far more sensible than e-mail critics who had questioned his parentage, motives, intelligence or understanding of the real world.<br>Senator Alston said the Government accepted that parents and guardians should be the main regulators of what their children accessed on the Net.<br>But the community demanded that its governments also impose some form of control.<br>Net censorship was needed because the community demanded the same standards online that applied elsewhere.<br>X and R-rated material was not available to under-18s on television or in films, videos or computer games.<br>The Net should be no different, particularly with coming convergence technology that would bring the medium on to TV screens.<br>A tangled Net, page 31<br></font></p>
