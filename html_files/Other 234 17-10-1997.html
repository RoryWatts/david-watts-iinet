            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FREMANTLE was chock-a-block with GYMs (gorgeous young mums) the other day. They were everywhere I looked in the fast food outlet where I had taken my children as a ?cultural? treat.<br>When the kids were little I could eat my own Whopper meal and a substantial part of the children's burgers, acting as a kind of human vacuum cleaner. It was a good greedy day out.<br>Now they are making me feel old, ever ready to pounce on my chips or guzzle my drink at the first sign of slowing up during the salty binge.<br>One week the Rembrandt exhibition, the next Hungry Jack's and Timezone.<br>Kids are certainly great levellers for those who are pretentious enough to call themselves sophisticated.<br>But the GYMs . . . they made a beautiful sight. In true Freo fashion they exposed hectares of navels. They also made one feel out of place if one had not pierced enough parts of the anatomy.<br>I like GYMs, but they have one small downside . . . children in tow. Well they wouldn't be GYMs if they didn't have kids I guess.<br>It is frightening the impact children make on your life. Not only do you become an aficionado of junk culture, but you find yourself turning into something you vowed you never would - your parents.<br>Where else but your upbringing would such phrases as ?money doesn't grow on trees? and ?turn that awful racket down? come from?<br>A correspondent named Kerri, who seems wise to all this, passed on this list of parental observations during the week. Interestingly they are entitled Parental Observations and seem to cover kids from their time as wee cuddly bairns right through to when they become aliens with pierced navels, back-to-front baseball caps and dubious musical tastes.<br>Let's start with my favourite:<br>© There would be fewer problems with children if they had to chop wood to keep the television set going.<br>Followed by number two . . .© The first sign of maturity is the discovery that the volume knob also turns to the left.<br>Then it's all downhill:<br>© A child will not spill on a dirty floor.<br>© A youth becomes a man when the marks he wants to leave on the world have nothing to do with tyres.<br>© An unbreakable toy is useful for breaking other toys.<br>© Familiarity breeds children.<br>© God invented mothers because He couldn't be everywhere at once.<br>© If a child looks like his father, that's heredity; if he looks like a neighbour, that's environment.<br>© If you have trouble getting your children's attention, just sit down and look comfortable.<br>© Insanity is inherited; you get it from your kids.<br>© It now costs more to amuse a child than it once did to educate his father.<br>© It rarely occurs to teenagers that the day will come when they'll know as little as their parents.<br>© Money isn't everything, but it sure keeps the kids in touch.<br>© You can learn many things from children - like how much patience you have.<br>© Those who say they ?sleep like a baby? haven't got one.<br>The very last observation is probably the wisest of all:<br>© The best thing to spend on your children is time.<br>o o oSPEAKING of GYMs, can anyone explain why one of my favourites could not see the humour in this joke?<br>A horse walks into a pub. The barman turns to him and says: ?Why the long face, buddy??<br>Yet the same lovely lady had to excuse herself from the room after hearing this one.<br>Tomato and Carrot went to a nightclub. They had a few drinks and Tomato spied the glamorous Broccoli.He decided to dance with her but Carrot became frightened, warning: ?Mate, Broccoli is Rhubarb's dame. If he sees you two together he'll kill you.?<br>But it was too late. Tomato swirled away with Broccoli into the wee hours. They had a sensational time.Just as they embraced, in burst Rhubarb. He beat Tomato to a pulp.<br>Carrot raced Tomato to the hospital. After hours of anxious waiting, a doctor summoned Carrot.<br>?I've got good news and bad news,? he said.<br>?The good news is that Tomato will live.<br>?The bad is that he'll be a vegetable.?<br>Women - I can't work them out.<br></font></p>
