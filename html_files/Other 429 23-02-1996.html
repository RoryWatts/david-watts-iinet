            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALMOST every candidate for the US presidential election is crooked or has some other nasty skeleton in the closet.<br>A Californian political watchdog committee, Real People for Real Change, has chosen the Internet to dump dirt not only on the frontrunners such as Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, but also on the never-wases such as Morry Taylor and Bob Dorman.<br>The campaign on the World Wide Web is designed to make the more than 20 million US Net users see past traditional media coverage which is said to be controlled by vested interests and lacking courage.<br>In the world of Watergate that is a big statement.<br>Real People for Real Change has listed an incredible number of foibles for presidential candidates.<br>Republican frontrunner Senator Dole is accused of giving numerous political favours to big money campaign contributors.<br>He is taken to task for his temper, ruthlessness and for being a divorcee who champions family values.<br>Mr Clinton gets by far the worst treatment.<br>He is accused (as he always is) of being a dope smoker, draft dodger, shady dealer through Whitewater and of being the ultimate baby boomer who just wants to go along with the crowd.<br>Even worse, he is criticised for his musical tastes - the President is a fan of Hootie and the Blowfish which the Net site describes as a lame band.<br>Some of the other skeletons brought out of the closet include:<br>?Pat Buchanan - called a hypocrite who has lived off the government and media all his life while constantly attacking them.<br>?Lamar Alexander - said to be guilty of dozens of sweetheart deals with business cronies and financial supporters ?that make Hillary Clinton's $100,000 commodities trade look puny?.<br>?Steve Forbes - branded a rich kid with little real world experience; also a bad manager and draft dodger guilty of sleazy land deals and hiding his tax return.<br>The only candidate who escapes Real People's wrath is Republican Richard Lugar ?actually ... a pretty upstanding guy?.<br>Real People was registered with the Federal Election Commission in 1992 as an independent action committee.<br>It says that with a few notable exceptions such as the Wall Street Journal, the media simply puts a Republican statement and balances it with a Democrat statement, allowing politicians to lie, cheat and distort.<br></font></p>
