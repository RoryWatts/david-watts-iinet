            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ON WEDNESDAY we take one more giant step for mankind ... into 1997, a year none of us has seen before - if we have been declared legally sane and haven't been captured by 10m tall aliens who feast on electricity.<br>And if we fit that category then we have no way of knowing exactly what the year will bring.<br>Not exactly, because there are some givens. It will rain in winter; the sun will set over the ocean; there will be a week of really hot weather; Mick Malthouse will say he is not happy despite an Eagles walkover; Bill Lawry will say the MCG is a great ground and Melbourne a great city (perhaps he's been captured by aliens), and you will pay taxes.<br>All in all that is not a big list and leaves open a few profound questions. Will I be handsome, will I be rich, will I be married/divorced/involved in a meaningful relationship, will I live, will I die, will I give up/take up smoking/drugs/rap music etc etc.<br>And as one of the modern era's great philosophers rhapsodised: ?Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be, the future's not our's to see ...?<br>Thank you Doris.<br>An old wives' tale has it that the tone of your year will be set by what you do as the New Year rolls in at 00:00:01 on January 1.<br>I don't really believe this. It's not because I haven't heard any old wives (anyone's) say it. The saying was passed to me by a group of party-going Queenslanders 20 New Year's Eves ago.<br>No I think this particular old wives' tale simply hasn't produced enough observable results in my own life.<br>It has worked on the dozen occasions when I've had to work on New Year's Eve. Sure enough I spent a good part of the next 12 months working.<br>But never have I been roaring drunk all year; nor sung loud, Scottish songs most of the time; nor engaged in an orgy of kissing every day of the year, nor have I spent an entire year comatose.<br>What you do at midnight New Year's Eve is often purely the product of what you've drunk since 7pm on New Year's Eve.<br>The safest perspective to take into the New Year may be the retro one, where you look back at the achievements of a year, a decade or even a century.<br>Let us, then, look back through history at years ending in 7 to see whether they harbour any clues about the coming 1997.<br>In 1967, the famed South African Dr Christiaan Barnard performed the first human heart transplant. The patient died 18 days later but the doctor got richer and richer.<br>In 1957, the old Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, into orbit. Americans countered by launching massive anti-Soviet propaganda because they couldn't get anything off the ground.<br>In 1947, Alfred Kinsey founded his Institute of Sex Research, and persevered despite finding out that sex had been discovered some years earlier.<br>Finally, we'll go back 60 years to 1937. That was the year American chemist Wallace Hume Carothers patented nylon. Within years this substance would alienate US soldiers from their allies, as the Yanks offered it freely to the women of Britain, Europe and Australasia.<br>The Hindenburg exploded, killing 36 people and spelling the end of the airship as a passenger-carrying facility. Sixty years later airships are once again popular because they give television watchers bird's eye views of sporting venues, and allow Bill Lawry to go on and on about how great Melbourne is when all you can see is smog and scudding dark clouds.<br>The biggest invention, however, was by US grocer Sylvan Goodman, who gave the world the first full-sized shopping trolley.<br>They can now be found in carparks, streets, rivers and occasionally shopping centres all over the globe.<br>Happy 1997.<br></font></p>
