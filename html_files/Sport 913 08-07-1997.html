            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE remote control was invented in 1956 and probably reached the peak of its popularity on Saturday night in Perth.<br>For anybody who had three TV sets with attached VCRs, the remote was the only way to keep pace with the sporting feast of football, Test cricket and Wimbledon.<br>Many hands would have been as sore as Steve Waugh's, because of the button-pressing needed to check if:<br>(a) The Dockers could seal Sydney's fate with a goal in the downpour.<br>(b) Waugh could force his jarred body to a historic second century, at Old Trafford.<br>(c) Martina Hingis could keep on smiling while fighting off a spirited Jana Novotna challenge to her teenage dreams.<br>Well, (a) they did, (b) he did - on Sunday, and (c) she did.<br>It was almost the same button-pressing mania last Friday, but Adelaide's thrashing of West Coast - with the writing on the wall and over the radio by quarter time - probably would have made channel-flicking a two-horse race.<br>Nine's decision to stick with the Sampras-Hingis-Woodies show from Wimbledon allowed cricket to be shown on what many consider its spiritual home - the ABC.<br>The ads were gone, the nagging reminders to buy, buy, buy were absent from the bottom of screens during play, and rain delays last Thursday were met with nostalgic cricketing documentaries about the game in the 1930s, with fascinating commentary from Sir Donald Bradman.<br>Bill Lawry, Tony Greig and Ian Chappell were still there, but with the commercialism gone, they seemed more mellow and contemplative ... even acceptable.<br>A Test without ads enabled viewers to see what goes on between overs. The chats and warm-ups might not be thrill-a-minute TV, but they are infinitely preferable to ear-bashing advertising, or Nine salesmanship.<br>The ear-bashing department was amply taken by Geoff Boycott, who can be knowledgeable and boring.<br>On Friday, he was almost prophetic, as England started to chase Australia's fragile-looking first innings of 235.<br>Boycott told Greig over and over that Shane Warne had been a ?great bowler?, but doubts lingered and he needed to prove himself all over again.<br>About two hours later, Warne did everything and more asked of him, and must surely have shut up doubters such as Boycott, for a couple of Tests at least.<br>Waugh silenced the doubters in spades.<br>Both his centuries came after the top order had failed, with England's tail up and the wicket and conditions against him.<br>They were great innings; the second, incredibly, more memorable because the pain in his right hand restricted his scoring power.<br>Some of the loudest commentary in this excellent Test is coming from the field itself.<br>Ian Healy is the voice most heard, especially when Warne is bowling: ?Great ball Shane ... Bowwlinng, Warney? and the simpler ?Ooohh? punctuate coverage every session that Australia is in the field.<br>The wicketkeeper adds his one-man chorus of approval for other bowlers, too.<br>But the tough Queenslander, who is having a very good match himself, hardly shuts up and is almost preferable to Boycott and Lawry.<br></font></p>
