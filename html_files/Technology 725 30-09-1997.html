            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Another cool site of the day page ? it is just what the Web needs. But this one, called Cool Site of the Day, surprisingly, is not a bad addition.<br>It purports to be the work of Professor Vinton Cool, a scientist at the Kleinrock-Engelbart Research Station on Deception Island.Sites are chosen for their use of technologies such as Shockwave (every Monday), Java (Tuesday) and ActiveX (Wednesday).One of Professor Cool's picks was Science Fiction Weekly, a Webzine to which sci-fi addicts can subscribe. It looked quite cool, so the professor appears to be on to something.<br>The focus is almost off the AFL. Time for soccer lovers to enjoy their place in the sun ? if they are following the game in Australia. But if you are a British soccer fan, a good place to keep in touch with Arsenal, Chelsea or perhaps even Scunthorpe is MATCH. It is a weekly football magazine that has put its Matchfacts section online.<br>It claims it covers every team, every game and every goal scored in Britain and rates every player's performance. It also offers fantasy football games.<br>HotWired has been cool for so long it sometimes seems it will chill out completely. But it is a mine of helpful information. A page to gladden the heart of aspiring Web authors is the Webmonkey HTML Reference Tool. Unlike a lot of the leading-edge stuff at HotWired, the reference page is an orthodox guide in easily-read format. It lists each HTML tag and its uses. Very simple ? very cool.<br>If you like a bit of yucky stuff (not necessarily smutty) when you browse, try SnotSheet, a self-styled guide to the Web's underbelly.<br>It is a send-up of HotSheet, which is an excellent resource for people looking for useful stuff. SnotSheet is also an excellent guide but to a far different world. It can take you to one of these sites for instance: You are Dumb, Dark Places, Private Parts, Troublemakers, Believe Lies, Frog Dissect, Yuckiest Site (a wonderful science resource for children), Goat Shrine, Useless Pages and Spice Girls Suck. They are just some of the 200 sites browsers have sent in.<br>HELP DESK<br>Cool Site of the Day: www.cool.com<br>Science Fiction Weekly: www.scifi.com/sfw/<br>Matchfacts: www.matchfacts.com<br>Webmonkey HTML Reference Tool: www.hotwired.com/<br>webmonkey/reference/index.html<br>SnotSheet: www.concentric.net/<br>~Gzero/index.shtml<br>HotSheet: www.hotsheet.com<br></font></p>
