            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">?YANKEES at Tara,? exclaimed Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind. She had just discovered that the boys in blue from the north had occupied her childhood southern mansion.<br>The way Vivien Leigh, as Scarlett, delivered the line, she could as easily have said ?That's absurd, unbelievable, preposterous?.<br>?Yankees at Tara? would have been an apt response to anyone who said last Monday: ?Gilchrist and Langer are both going to score tons and Australia will win the Test.?<br>Rats in the western suburbs doesn't have quite the same dramatic ring unfortunately. It looks a bit unbelievable and slightly preposterous; after all it does seem strange that our better-heeled suburbs are home to a healthy population of the unhealthy rodents.<br>But that's been the case for a long time, so rats in the western suburbs isn't that big a shock. They love the closeness of the river and the leafy vegetation so luxuriant over there.<br>I hasten to add I am not talking about the type of rats that drive convertibles and wear designer clothes, though the west has its fair quota. What I am referring to is defined by the Encyclopedia Britannica as ?any of the more than 500 named forms of the genus Rattus, family Muridae (order Rodentia) . . . dark animals with pointed noses and naked feet and tails; they are similar to, but generally larger than, mice.?<br>When I first came to Perth in the early 80s I lived for a time in Swanbourne and had a very ?Yankees at Tara? attitude to rats in the western suburbs. My two cats didn't though. They used to decapitate them and leave them in the shower recess to show what useful moggies they were.<br>This didn't unduly worry me, but caused several outbursts from a flatmate of delicate constitution.<br>But back to the present. The other day I was sitting quietly on the back veranda communing with nature, or more likely wondering why there were so many rats in the western suburbs, when a beer can fell out of the sky and dropped at my feet. It was empty and not even a brand I like, unfortunately.<br>The conclusion from this is not only are there rats in the western suburbs, there are a lot of crows as well.<br>The proper collective noun is actually murder - as in a murder of crows - which is precisely what a lot of people would like to do to them.<br>A neighbour has even come to the door with a petition imploring the council to do something about them. Among her grievances was that the crows liked to feast on healthy, red bottlebrush, then head for the nearest line of clean washing - white sheets a specialty - to do their toilet.<br>What crows seem to like too is anything bright and shiny. One western suburbs man, who shall remain nameless, is a social leper who likes the odd cigarette. So he partakes of his expensive and filthy habit outside, using an outside table as a resting place for his cigarettes and lighter.<br>Lately his habit has been just as filthy but a lot more expensive. On Monday night he left a packet with about 15 fags in it on the table. On Tuesday morning it was gone.<br>The story was similar the following night and day, and ditto for the ones after that.<br>Nicotine has obviously dulled his brain but he now thinks he will take the coffin nails inside with him at night. That way the thieving crows won't swoop on them and carry them off in the wee hours, will they?<br>Somewhere, someone sitting in their leafy backyard has probably been rained on by Benson and Hedges, tipped out by a clumsy crow.<br>Why doesn't he see the error of his ways and just give up?<br>His response . . . aaaarrk!<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
