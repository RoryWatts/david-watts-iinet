            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I FEEL too well to go to work, so I work from home. Places of work are not places to work. And they can be injurious to your health, unless you are one of those nerdy bods who gets high on stress.<br>All those people who believe the modern-day workplace is a place to work hard at avoiding have had their suspicions confirmed this week with a British survey by a group called Office Angels. It was not a big survey, only 1000 people answered it. But obviously they were the only ones who felt well enough to respond. For all we know hundreds of thousands could have been asked to take part but were too sick after yet another day of misery at the modern treadmill.<br>Office Angels, a secretarial recruitment company, found that modern office workers are the victims of ?desk rage?. This is a new social phenomenon to compare with already well-documented ?road rage? and ?air rage?. And such a finding must be applauded. What we definitely need to see out the millennium is another social phenomenon.<br>Without it, armies of psychologists, behavioural scientists, trauma counsellors and the waiting shoals of compensation lawyers would be facing bleak times. They might even suffer from ?social phenomenon rage?, in which great stress and anxiety is caused by there being no great stress and anxiety to worry about.<br>But anyway, the above-mentioned merchants of angst have their new social phenomenon. Office Angels says that the findings of its survey appear to show ?desk rage? as manifesting itself in the following way:<br>From the moment most people enter the workplace on a Monday morning, an intense, low-level conflict over space, territory, privacy and manners erupts. The result is escalating stress. Some people apparently find this stress stimulating, say the Angels. ?But for the rest of us (it) invariably proves fatal,? said a report on the survey in the Guardian in London.<br>Here are some of the ?desk rage? symptoms identified by an office worker who wrote about the Angels survey for the same paper:Not saying good morning;Not turning off mobile phones in meetings;Leaving a jammed printer or photocopier for someone else to fix;Talking loudly, usually about one's private life;Petty selfishness such as making coffee without offering one to colleagues;Untidiness in the kitchen (especially leaving milk out of the fridge and letting it go off);Loitering by a desk if someone is on the phone;Sitting about looking depressed the whole time;Peering at others' computer screens (particularly when they are composing long, convoluted e-mails instead of delivering the message face-to-face).<br>We at The West Australian are well aware of ?desk rage?. Once upon a time, the practitioners of journalism were allowed to do their business while seated in a friendly group around open fireplaces. They could puff away on pipes while indulging in witty repartee and delivering the latest news. Times changed but there was always a feeling that a day at the office was one well spent in affable company with one's intellectual peers.<br>And besides, you could smoke your lungs out and there was a pub just a short stagger from the front doors.<br>For the past 18 months, this paper has been housed in the very latest, most wired, most 90s surroundings imaginable. There are nests of desks where comrades can sit close together and commune with their computer screens while looking totally disinterested in the world.<br>But I shouldn't go on about this. After all I have the luxury of sitting in my home office where I can have a well-earned kip every thousand words or so on a nearby bed, or turn the TV to what I want and not CNN or Sky racing.<br>And I'm afraid that if I do go on about ?desk rage? and conditions in the office, then one of the sub-editors who has to go to the office, and no doubt is beset by ?desk rage?, will take their cursor to my column and cut out the last wo . . .<br></font></p>
