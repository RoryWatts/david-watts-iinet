            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Y2K<br>National Coordination Centre<br>www.y2kaustralia.gov.au<br>NOTHING much is on show here yet, but in 10 to 11 days it might be a place of heavy activity ... that is if the Y2K bug doesn't knock out the power to access the Web. And it would also be essential viewing only if you intended to celebrate the New Year in the company of your PC and other Netizens, all keeping a blurry eye on the bug.<br>The Federal Government, which is responsible for this site, is confident it will not get a dishonourable mention in the Y2K stakes. Communications Minister Richard Alston last week announced that all Commonwealth-funded agencies had achieved 100 per cent compliance on business critical systems.<br>Senator Alston's parliamentary secretary, Ian Campbell, said last week the coordination centre site would allow a global audience to monitor Australia's progress through the date change quickly.<br>The site will provide event and status reports by sector and State/Territory, the latest news, and links to New Zealand and the UN-sponsored International Year 2000 Cooperation Centre.<br>E-MAIL<br>Perthmail<br>www.perthmail.com<br>FREE Web-based e-mail is one of the handiest attractions of the medium, allowing users access to mail when they are unable to use their personal Net accounts.<br>This latest entrant in the field is from Perth, one of several projects from the creators of the WA directory service, Perthinter.net.<br>SANTA E-MAIL<br>www.crystal.com.au<br>I SP Crystal gives children a last-minute chance to e-mail Santa and receive a reply at its home page which has been dressed up for Christmas by Australian Internet Pages design.<br>MATCH-MAKING<br>Find love<br>findlove.com.au<br>FIND Love is definitely not an adult site - for which read, pornographic - according to its Perth creators who launched it three weeks ago.<br>They say material is non-explicit and it is suitable for genuine seekers of company of all ages.<br>Site users can view thousands of potential friends or lovers free; view local, national and international membership; submit their own biography and picture; and read advice on subjects such as flirting.<br>Membership, which starts about $40 a year, allows site users to send e-mails to people of their choice from the lists of companion seekers.<br>FUN<br>404 Research Lab<br>www.plinko.net/404/<br>THE Web is a dynamic place, but that in itself can cause much frustration when pages or whole sites move or simply disappear. A link that worked the day before now takes the user to an error 404 or ?Web page not found? notice.<br>Well it had to happen, someone with an obvious amount of spare time, has decided to collect those 404 notices and give them a site of their own.<br>Links to the best 404 errors have been researched and placed in scores of categories for browsing.<br></font></p>
