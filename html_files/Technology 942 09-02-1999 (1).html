            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE $168 million penalty against anti-abortionists who published a ?hit list? of doctors on the Web has sparked renewed debate about whether the Internet can be policed.<br>A snap poll of Net users by the BBC last Thursday found 51 per cent thought it could be.<br>The poll's proposition was that it was commonly thought the Net was associated with freedom of expression.<br>But after a federal jury in Portland, Oregon, found that wanted-style posters of abortion doctors on the Nuremberg Files site amounted to death threats, defendant Catherine Ramney said: ?This is a moral and constitutional outrage. There was no threat and they knew it.?<br>This outburst added to controversies and law suits against Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist sites, the BBC said at a special site set up for comment.<br>?There is a strong culture that believes the Net as a medium should represent every kind of view and information,? the site said.<br>But it was also recognised that certain material should be filtered to protect children.<br>Dilemmas in the online world were growing.<br>In the same week that the anti-abortionists were fined, a US judge ruled that the Child Online Protection Act - designed to penalise sites that made pornography accessible to minors - was unconstitutional on the ground of the right to freedom of speech.<br>Some reactions from Web surfers who voted in the poll:<br>?How do you police a global network whilst each country has its own set of laws? What is legal here isn't somewhere else, and vice versa ... I police myself quite adequately thanks.?<br>?It cannot and should not be policed. If you don't like what you see, don't look.?<br>?An international standards body should draw up a set of minimum standards based on current film censorship standards and those sites infringing these should have their IP addresses wiped off the Internet.?<br>?I'm pretty sure that when our founding fathers drafted the constitution, the intention was to allow people to express their opinions about religion, politics, and social issues.<br>?Their hearts were in the right place, but I doubt they could have ever imagined that the 20th century would usher in telephones, radio, television and the Internet.<br>?Maybe the idea that these new communications tools could allow a person to deliver messages of hate and destruction worldwide would have given the forefathers pause, possibly to add a few caveats to the rights of free speech.?<br>?Of course the Internet should and could be policed. The responsibility for this rests with us all.?<br></font></p>
