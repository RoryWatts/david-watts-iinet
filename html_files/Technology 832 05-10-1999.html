            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HO-HUM, last week was another average one in the world of the Internet.<br>Consider these developments:<br>? A meeting of the World Tourism Organisation in Santiago, Chile, was told that the Web would be instrumental in increasing the number of visitors to Australia in the wake of the Sydney Olympics. Between four billion and seven billion hits are expected at the official Games site and the Australian Tourism Commission is ecstatic because it believes one billion of those Web visits will click through to its site for destination information.<br>Five years ago the ATC had no Web presence. But by last year nine million pages were downloaded from its site (at www.australia.com).<br>? The Financial Times reported that Microsoft will offer its popular desktop software for rent over the Net as early as the first quarter of next year. Microsoft is aiming to beat rival Sun Microsystems, which has already started offering some of its competing software for free download. Among the first MS products for rent will be desktop applications for the coming new version of the NT operating system, Windows 2000.<br>?A report by the British Chartered Institute of Bankers said the Net and the telephone would overtake the branch as the most popular way of banking within five years. The report, based on a survey of most of the country's biggest financial institutions, predicted the rapid decline of the branch as the primary way of dealing with banks, from 60 per cent of customers today to just 44 per cent by 2004.<br>These three items are just the tip of the iceberg, of course. The amazing has become commonplace in a short time. One person who feels many of us take the medium for granted is British academic and journalist John Naughton.<br>His sense of anger at the failure to fully appreciate the Net as a giant leap for mankind has sparked a book called A Brief History of the Future.<br>?Part of the reason I wrote the book was that I was becoming enraged by the sort of complacency with which people were accepting it and the kind of condescending way in which they were taking it for granted,? Naughton said. ?The Net ... is so complicated and yet it works with astonishing resilience and it provides things I would have killed for as a child.?<br>Naughton said his book ends with comments about the growth of the open source movement which had popularised a set of values that were quite alien to the business world in its free distribution of software without any proprietary code, allowing others to improve on it and pass it on.<br>But he said he was concerned about the values that big business was bringing to the Net with an obsession for ensuring security.<br></font></p>
