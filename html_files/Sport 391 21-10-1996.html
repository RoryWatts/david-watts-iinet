            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NO ROY or HG, nor Sam or Trevor; not even Brooksy. For those wanting a dose of laughter with their sport, the program guide looks bare at this time of the year.<br>Yet there is a poor man's substitute who may amuse some. He certainly appears to amuse himself well enough.<br>Darrell Eastlake at Channel 9 is big and loud and prone to chuckling at his own jokes. He is the epitome of a real bloke and his big basso profundo now seems as much a part of motor cycle racing as leathers, helmets and crashes. And Eastlake loves crashes.<br>His already-loud voice steps a few more octaves at the first sign of a skid, then tempers as he chuckles to the viewer: ?Awh, he's orright. They make em tough ... ?<br>It is as though Eastlake only ever learnt to write in capital letters. On Saturday and yesterday he was at his amazing best (or worst) calling the Australian Motor Cycling Grand Prix at Eastern Creek.<br>Let us look at Saturday, because that is when Nine decided that grand prix practice was as important as the Caulfield Cup.<br>THE station provided blanket coverage of both for Wide World of Sports, which was a warning sign for those who have come to associate this show with lots of slow-motion replays of spectacular crashes and goofs with loud rock music accompaniment.<br>Arctic Scent just had an improbable victory and Nine covered the race well from various angles, doing well to get a few words out of the winning, yet stunned 17-year-old jockey, Brett Stanley.<br>A link to an interview with the horse's connections failed. Anchorman Ken Sutcliffe, polished as ever, said the after-cup coverage would continue after a commercial break.<br>But after the break it was back to Eastern Creek, Eastlake and the drone of engines.<br>Little Barry Sheene (the one who tries to be funny in petrol stations) was analysing a rider's chances and was wearing headphones and microphone set.<br>Eastlake boomed: ?Bazza, in that get-up you deadset look like a low-altitude blowfly.?<br>To which ?Bazza? mumbled something about ?Dazza? not looking so great himself.<br>Was it really worth interrupting Caulfield Cup day for that?<br>Nine's extreme treatment of sport was in stark contrast to the ABC's coverage of the Little Masters Tennis Challenge at Port Stephens, NSW.<br>A couple of cameras, a handful of family and friends for the crowd and the scores posted manually. But the under-15s and 17s gave the small crowd some good tennis.<br>Far better TV for the ABC was the Queensland Open Golf. What it lacked in heavyweight players it made up for with excellent camera work, good comments from Ian Baker-Finch and Bob Shearer and some nice play from a band of talented youngsters.<br>The no-nonsense coverage somehow made viewers feel like they were really on the course.<br></font></p>
