            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AIR BUD<br>One day someone will put a dog in a movie that's just a dog - a simple creature that likes to sniff bums and loves anyone who gives it food. For now we'll have to put up with canines of uncanny intelligence and ability, the latest a former circus performer called Buddy who has the ability to sink hoops like Michael Jordan. When his owner, a lonely 12-year newcomer to the district named Josh (Kevin Zeggers), is appointed manager of the junior high school basketball team, Buddy is appointed the mascot. Naturally, Buddy is not content to sit on the sidelines and look cute. During the middle of a big game he bounds on court and sinks a basket, giving the team a shot at the championship. Complications occur when Buddy's original owner, played by the wonderful Michael Jeter, returns to claim his property. Doesn't sound promising but the respected critic Roger Ebert claims Air Bud has ?freshness and energy? and that ?the climactic scenes are not only absurd and goofy but also enormously entertaining?. Rated G (Not Previewed)<br>THE BORROWERS HHHH<br>Anyone who has ever wondered where all those missing socks go, or has torn their hair out searching for car keys, will be intrigued by The Borrowers, a charming and imaginative fantasy about a family of little people who exist by stealing - make that ?borrowing? - the necessities of life from big people. The Clocks, headed by the daring Pod (Jim Broadbent), are forced to leave their comfortable quaint old London home when the crooked lawyer cum realtor Ocious P. Potter (John Goodman) decides to evict the tenants to make way for a block of luxury apartments. When the younger Clocks and the tenant's son Pete (Bradley Pierce) discover that the will of the late owner has been stolen they launch a Lilliputian assault on the odious Ocious. Based on Mary Norton's popular 1950s children's stories, The Borrowers is a marvel of old and new special effects technology, with the miniature people beautifully integrated to their oversized world. We've seen this kind of thing before in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids but The Borrowers is far more inventive, giving us a mind-boggling view of the universe beneath the floor. Will keep big and little holidaying humans very amused. Rated G (Mark Naglazas)<br>HOME ALONE 3 HH12<br>A pity John Hughes didn't think to put the now-engaged Macaulay Culkin into this third instalment of the hugely successful series and call it Home Alone With The Wife. It might have freshened up material that felt stale when Home Alone 2 came out. Once again a kid is left at home to fend for himself, this time because he has chickenpox and the rest of the family are too busy to babysit. Due to a mix-up at the airport Little Alex (Alex D. Linz in the Culkin role) winds up with a remote-controlled car that has a stolen computer chip hidden inside. When a band of terrorists try to retrieve the chip Alex, who is a whole lot smarter and tougher than the baddies, turns into the two-pint Terminator, using high and low tech to crush their spirits as well as their bones. While the earlier Home Alone films at least tried to make the youngster's genius for setting painful traps plausible, the third edition severs all ties with reality, giving Alex near-clairvoyant ability to second-guess the baddies. The result is a predictable, violent cartoon of a movie which will have kids whooping and parents wincing. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>LEAVE IT TO BEAVER HHH<br>An obvious question to ask about this film is: ?Why bother?? Surely it is another example of the Hollywood sausage machine raiding a scarce cupboard of ideas and plucking out an old TV sitcom, in this case one so laden with dreams of ?Mom's apple pie? and small-town USA that it is as relevant to 90s Australians as the Turkish constitution. But director Andy Cadiff lightly spoofs the great American dream - Barbie-like housewives doing the vacuuming in pearls and high-heels - so nicely that the tale of a cute eight-year-old's battle for a bike becomes a pleasant, family viewing experience. And even though it looks like a homage to materialism and suburbia, it turns out to be a likeable essay about parenting and unconditional love. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>LOST IN SPACE<br>This latest US ?blockbuster"and the one to finally topple Titanic from its No. 1 spot might not be the most mentally challenging film of the year - but it's not the dud many US critics are claiming either. The year is 2058, Earth has less than 20 years left in it and the scientific family Robinson are off on a mission to colonise a new planet. But the corrupt Dr Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman, as his second space age baddie in less than a year) has other ideas. He stows away on their saucer-like ship the Jupiter 2, sabotages their robot and the result is the family become lost in space. There's danger, Will Robinson!, at every turn -crumbling planets, crashed spaceships, a rogue robot - even family dysfunction to contend with. Witty one liners keep the dialogue alive while amazing special effects steal the show, especially the scene in which Will uses virtual reality and hologram technology to take over the crippled robot and fight off a hoard of alien spiders. If the 60s TV series was camp, this one is pure corniness! Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>MORTAL KOMBAT ANNIHILATION HHH<br>This is the sequel to the film Mortal Kombat, based on the video game of the same name. Mortal Kombat saw the Earth's greatest warriors fighting the minions of Shao-Kahn, emperor of the Outworld, to prevent his entry into Earth's realm. Now Shao-Kahn has changed the rules of the game. He is coming in person with his extermination squads and even the elder gods are powerless to stand in his way. It is up to the survivors of Mortal Kombat and their new allies - former special forces member Jax (Lynn Red Williams), with cybernetically controlled titanium arms, Jade (Irina Pantaeva), a beautiful refugee from Outworld, and the native American Shaman Nightwolf (Litefoot) - to stand and fight. They battle against Shao-Kahn (Brian Thompson) and his fantastic and fearsome legion of generals - Sindel (Musetta Vander), once a beautiful queen, now a ghastly vision of living death; Sheeva (Marjean Olden), a four-armed female fighting machine; Motaro (Deron McBee), a monstrous centaur; Cyrax (J.J. Perry), a cyber-ninja with a rocket launcher built into his chest, and Mileena (Dana Hee), sister of Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) from the Outworld, who is allied with the humans. Fans of the video games will recognise the characters from all three of the Mortal Kombat series. Rated M (Ryan Emery)<br>RUDYARD KIPLING'S SECOND JUNGLE BOOK: MOWGLI AND BALOO<br>Despite the author's name included in what must be the longest movie title in memory this Jungle Book doesn't sound like it has all that much to do with Rudyard Kipling, save the name of boy and the bear. Set in India circa 1890, the story opens with junior jungle boy Mowgli (James Williams) stumbling into the human world and being pursued as the next curiosity for the PT Barnum circus. The Barnum scout enlists the help of local grandee Buldeo to help track Mowgli. Buldeo seems affable but he has his own designs on Mowgli, who is likely to be his nephew and the sole legal block to Buldeo gaining control of his late brother's fabulous estate. While this latest Kipling movie has been criticised for lack of imagination and racial and cultural stereotyping, it seems the meshing of man and beast in the same shots is impressive. Sounds like one for the younger brigade. Rated PG (Not Previewed)<br></font></p>
