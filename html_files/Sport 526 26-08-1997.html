            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LOSERS littered the sporting landscape all weekend.<br>Through the magic of television, we were able to check their body language and maybe look into their eyes, if not their hearts.<br>But as sport is a reflection of life, not everything was as it seemed.<br>There were losers among the winners, and vice versa.<br>England's cricketers allowed Channel 9 to show a Sunday night movie with impunity for the first time during the Ashes series.<br>Saturday night's Australian collapse at The Oval was a losing spectacle.<br>When Graham Thorpe plucked Glenn McGrath's spooned catch you would, as Tony Greig put it, have thought England had won the Ashes.<br>England was a loser despite the Test victory made possible by the unlikely hero, spinner Phil Tufnell.<br>The Ashes were safe in Australia's hands, Jason Gillespie and Paul Reiffel were out, and Shane Warne had a dodgy groin.<br>There was not a lot to play for or with. And Andy Caddick and Tufnell gave England some heart at last, something the Aussies wrenched out from just after Lord's nearly two months ago.<br>The series was 3-2 and not 4-1. So what?<br>England's cricketers played manfully, but could not overcome their disastrous selectors, soft domestic preparation and ultra-critical press and public.<br>If you need evidence of cricketing folly, look no further than the selection of Devon Malcolm.<br>He is rolled out like a magical trump-card when England is in its regular state of panic, and always bowls far more unspeakable balls than unplayable ones.<br>Australia was not the only loser.<br>But why should Channel 7 news on Sunday night say the tour had been soured by the English victory?<br>It was nonsense, as was the voice-over on Sportsworld that morning, demanding the urn containing the Ashes be brought to Australia.<br>On Seven and Sportsworld: it obviously was the show's duty to tell us the result of the South Africa-Australia rugby union Test (61-22 to the Springboks - we were definite losers), but did the network have to rub it in by showing the full replay at noon?<br>Loser, too, was West Coast, which went down to Western Bulldogs at the miserable Whitten Oval by 18 points on Saturday. The Eagles lost the game and Tony Liberatore's bunch of spoiling scraggers won it, courtesy of a six-goal jump-start.<br>But the way the Eagles came back in the second half and the pride with which they finished gave hope.<br>You have to say that the Bulldogs were losers, too. No longer will they have such a godforsaken home ground and the advantage of such emotion.<br>Their street-fighting ways might come under the microscope, too, after the fiery opening. I am of the dinosaur brigade that does not mind a bit of biff, but Terry Wallace's boys are good enough to let their football do more of the talking.<br></font></p>
