            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GEEK humour isn't too bad when you get used to it - you just have to be totally absorbed in computers.<br>The US magazine, Information Week, put out a list of new viruses recently. They include:<br>? Paul Revere Virus: This revolutionary virus doesn't horse around. It warns you of impending hard disk attack: One if by LAN, two if by C:/.<br>? Congressional Virus: The computer locks up, and the screen splits erratically with a message appearing on each half of the monitor blaming the other side for the problem.<br>? Freudian Virus: Your computer becomes obsessed with its own motherboard.<br>The US Internet giant c/net publishes a regular bulletin which includes bizarre top 10 lists.<br>Last week it produced the top 10 signs of talking to a PC slacker.<br>c/net defined slackers as people who spend hours working very hard at utterly trivial tasks.<br>Some sayings which give the game away:<br>? ?Playing Solitaire? No. I'm honing my drag-and-drop skills while developing my deductive reasoning.?<br>? ?My productivity will increase as soon as I find the right colour scheme and wallpaper for my desktop.?<br>? ?Anyone can reboot a PC. I'm working on a visual basic script that can do it from a taskbar button in Excel.?<br></font></p>
