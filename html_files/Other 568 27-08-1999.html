            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT'S in a name? A tired, old question, but when your name is Watts it takes on a lively new life.<br>I've had the following conversation on the phone countless times:<br>Person on phone : And what's your name?<br>Me: That's right.<br>POP: No, what's your name please?<br>Me: I've told you.<br>POP: Let's start again. Your name?<br>Me: David.<br>POP : And what's your surname.<br>Me: Exactly right.<br>This ordinary surname - whose only derivation I can find is ?common? - even got me close to a mugging in New York. It didn't really, but that is how I felt at the time.<br>I was on a business trip and had developed a nasty ear infection on the flight over. I could hardly hear and was in enough pain to ask that my hotel send for a doctor.<br>His name was Dr Ortz and, being a New Yorker, he spoke with a New York accent. He knocked at my hotel room door which I had closed with all four available locks and chains in case of intrusion by typical New York thug-mugger-murderers as seen on TV.<br>Doctor: Mr Warts (told you it was a New York accent).<br>Me: What? Who's that?<br>Doctor: Mr Warts, it's Dr Ortz.<br>Me: Can't understand a word, go away.<br>Doctor: But it's Dr Ortz, Mr Warts, ya wanna ged bedder doncha?<br>Me: What?<br>It went on until I finally abandoned myself to being murdered, robbed and beaten up as one does in New York. Actually, Dr Ortz was pleasant enough and gave me a prescription for drugs which had to be bought at a drugstore five blocks away in midtown Manhattan.<br>Trouble was, it was midnight and to my mind the streets were full of murderers, robbers and thugs. But my ear was killing me, so I took a chance nothing else would and scurried off to the drugstore, all the while jumping at shadows and continually crossing the street to get out of the way of people who were obviously murderers, robbers and thugs.<br>As you might have guessed, I was not murdered, nor was I beaten up or robbed. The only person who said boo to me was the jolly fellow in the drugstore who, between making sandwiches for murderers and thugs on their coffee breaks, dispensed medicines. ?Now, Mr Warts, the dawkta says no alcohol or drivin' heavy machinery, ya hear. Take care wid dese drugs.?<br>But enough of my name and its ramifications. Have you noticed that this week the world is alive with rich, wonderful names, far more exciting than Watts or Smith or Brown?<br>Perhaps because my own is so common, I am fascinated by names which you can roll around the tongue or even sing.<br>That's why I have been devoted to the World Athletic Championships in Seville and have neglected the Aussie gold rush at the Pan Pacific swimming.<br>The swimming's great, but it can't match names like Tatiana Grigorieva, Debbie Sosimenko, Dmitriy Markov, Kyle van der Kuyp and Tania van Heer. And that's just the Australians.<br>The swimming - dripping in success as it may be - is a little mundane. You cannot do much with everyday names such as Ian Thorpe, Grant Hackett and Susan O'Neill. You can always cheer, of course, but a name like Sosimenko conjures up images of exotic cuisine. ?I'll try the Sosimenko, thanks,? you might say to some trendy waiter in the latest Belorussian-Moldovan chic eatery.<br>The best names of the week have been in the lost and founds. Count yourself fortunate to have been alive in a week that not only gave us Robert Bogucki but also Garrison St Clair.<br>They are names so grand you could easily imagine them in the credits of a movie . . . couldn't you?<br></font></p>
