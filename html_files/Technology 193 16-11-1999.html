            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Encyclopedia Britannica is free on the Web at last, overcoming teething troubles that required virtual root canal surgery.<br>Britannica.com, the company established to push the Rolls-Royce of encyclopedias on the Net, initially launched the free site on October 19.<br>But the public thirst for free information was so big - between 15 million and 18 million hits - that it knocked out the site within hours.<br>A lower-key relaunch just over a week ago had engineers working round the clock to upgrade the site to meet demand.<br>Since the first weekend in November the site has been operating as intended, offering all 32 volumes of the encyclopedia, plus images and a wealth of Web-based material such as updated news and features.<br>Britannica.com hopes to make a profit by selling advertising on the site.<br>The first evidence that the site would be more than just a powerful and authoritative search engine emerged last week.<br>Clicking open Britannica.com caused a second window to activate.<br>On one occasion this was filled with psychedelic 60s-like images offering to take the user to a special feature about pop culture with attendant prompts to buy books etc.<br>On another occasion, the pop-up contained news of various global charities and ways to donate to them.<br>Both could be closed easily so that the job of browsing the world's oldest and best known encyclopedia free could begin.<br>Web users have been able to access Britannica online for nearly four years now, but that has been through paid subscriptions of about $8 a month at the EB Online site.<br>EB and Britannica can be easily compared by opening both sites in adjoining browser screens, then asking both to do the same search. This can be done via the back door free by taking a 30-day free trial with EB Online.<br>The paid-for EB is faster and returns many more results from the encyclopedia on one page.<br>EB is also commercial-free and devoted purely to research material so its site and workings are comparatively uncluttered.<br>Yet the free Britannica.com, despite its pop-up advertisements and a welcome screen full of diversions, still delivers the same articles and images as EB. It also offers lists of recommended Web sites about the search topic as well as links to books and other material that can be bought online.<br>Encyclopedia users now have four choices with Britannica: the free Web version at www.britannica.com; the subscriber version at www.eb.com; the CD version for computers that costs between $99 and $199, and the traditional bound volumes that start at $998 for a 1995 edition and go up to an $11,998 specially bound 1998 edition.<br>A fifth alternative of a cheap, pirated CD version, often available at overseas holiday destinations, is not recommended.<br></font></p>
