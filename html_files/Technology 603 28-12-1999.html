            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TOP PICKS OF 99<br>Yahoo's top sites<br>www.yahoo.com/picks/<br>YOU don't always need to take Web Sights' word for what is new and worthy out there.<br>This retrospective of 1999 sites comes from one of the Web's powerhouses, Yahoo. Its picks of the year are being done in two parts because of the enormous amount of material recommended by surfers and scrutinised by editors. Yahoo gathers about 20 sites a week and recommends them either at its picks site or via e-mail newsletter. Its word on the best 50 or so sites for a year in which it has looked at more than 1000 should provide plenty of bookmarking and holiday browsing.<br>The biggest problem will be de-Americanising the list. Many picks have been illuminations of US history or society, excluding the millions of us who want something more global.<br>Some of the featured sites in Yahoo's first selection are outstanding use of the medium, however. The BBC World Service special on My Century and the children's educational site, BrainPOP, are top illustrations of how the Net can be used.<br>FISHING<br>Fisheries, Western Australia<br>www.wa.gov.au/westfish/<br>HOLIDAYS mean fishing for thousands of West Australians, and this official site has a lot to help enjoy dangling a line even more.<br>It takes an exhaustive look at the State's 12,000km of coastline and the variety of angling locations, from the cold waters of Esperance to the coral reef systems and mangroves of the tropical North-West.<br>It explains size and bag limits, protected areas and conservation areas. Then it casts its net wide to look at licensed species such as marron and abalone.<br>There are comprehensive guides to the many species waiting to be caught, or preserved, as well as visitor guides to areas such as the Abrolhos and recommendations on how to care for your catch.<br>SPORT<br>Official Anna Kournikova Site<br>www.kournikova.com<br>HOLIDAYS also mean top tennis on TV and a glimpse of Russian glamour girl Anna Kournikova.<br>Her official site is brilliantly presented. Click sections for an Anna-ful in person, in action, in the news, in fun or in an online store.<br>There are plenty of pictures, offering a slide show or streaming video for those with faster connections.<br>The fun section examines Ms Kournikova's famous forehand, then gives browsers the chance to dress their idol in clothes that can be designed on-screen.<br></font></p>
