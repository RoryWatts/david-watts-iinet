            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ATLANTA '96 from the safety of an armchair, or more likely a bed, given the 12-hour time difference, really is a case of the sublime to the ridiculous.<br>These Games are making good TV so far.<br>How could a viewer resist the emotion of Martin Luther King's ?I have a dream? speech, leading to the poignant spectacle of a shaky Muhammad Ali lighting the fuse to the Olympic cauldron Mission Impossible style?<br>The opening ceremony on Saturday made for a lot of long, unconventional brunches throughout WA.<br>First, there was a hint of the ridiculous as Channel 7's Garry Wilkinson and Sandy Roberts told us repeatedly about the stadium being ?jam-packed with 85,000 spectators? just as the cameras panned on row on row of empty seats in what is officially an 83,000-seat stadium.<br>But overall it was a spectacle with everything: opera, soft rock, gospel and plenty of goosebumps, particularly when the original Balmain Battler, Dawn Fraser, took her place centre stadium with other greats like Mark Spitz, Bob Beamon and Nadia Comaneci as popularly voted Olympic legends.<br>Then Dr Luther King's speech with the wonderful wish that all men are created equal.<br>Shortly followed the man who gave this the lie throughout his great career. The former Cassius Clay, Rome boxing gold medallist, lit the torch and touched the world.<br>No one could touch the pretty boy in the 60s and 70s and no matter what you think of boxing, Ali was the epitome of athleticism - surely a superman.<br>To see him touched by the Great Leveller, to be a worried looking, shaky middle-aged man cruelly hit by Parkinson's disease was one of the most moving television moments of any Games.<br>It is as if the great Hollywood director Michael Kurtiz had scripted it in his unique way: ?Start with the earthquake and build up to the climax?.<br>So when the real sport coverage began at 9pm, what did we have? - Elli Overton goes shopping for Speedos.<br>For some reason this was the first highlight of Seven's live cover. Unfortunately the Speedos Elli bought in the little Atlanta postcard segment did not do enough for her in the 400m individual medley.<br>But the swimming coverage was superb, and not just for the underwater, overhead and super slo-mo camera shots that made Chinese 100m gold medallist Le Jingyi look like a ravaging white pointer.<br>To see Ireland, New Zealand and a man called Fred from Belgium dominate the pool was the greatest surprise of all.<br>It appeared to make Neil Brooks' pre-meeting comments about not being sure who would win what seem positively delphic.<br>Overall there weren't many hiccups, although one cross to the gymnastics found us looking at the Italians vaulting over the horse, while the commentators extolled the virtue of Aussies Brett Hudson and Brennon Dowrick on the parallel bars.<br>Coverage of our women's hockey victory over Spain was excellent, but the Boomers streeting Korea, France beating the seemingly lacklustre Olyroos and Cuba showing us how to play baseball all lacked excitement.<br></font></p>
