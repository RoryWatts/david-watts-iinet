            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>Dr Dolittle (PG)<br>Eddie Murphy<br>Directed by Betty Thomas<br>H H H½<br>Review: David Watts<br>PARENTS might have their worst fears about their children realised if they take them to see the Eddie Murphy film Dr Dolittle these school holidays.<br>There are a lot of bottom jokes guaranteed to provoke waves of laughter from the young. You have to be honest; kids are mad about bodily functions, not to mention cute animals that just happen to speak their language.<br>Both elements are played to the full in this very 90s updating of the classic tale about a doctor who can talk to and understand animals.<br>The bottom line, so to speak, is that it is pretty basic, rude and crude, exploiting the cutesy notion of talking animals with human personalities.<br>But it is a lot of fun. This might sound surprising given that computerisation and special effects have made animals appear to talk for some time. Babe was a classic example of this type of shameless anthropomorphism.<br>Yet it seems that this very basic appeal to bottoms, bums or butts, and animals with modern attitude, is Dr Dolittle's attraction.<br>Eddie Murphy as the doctor avoids hamming it up, preferring to play the role of a stressed-out, 40-something GP with a successful practice, very straight indeed.<br>This way he lets the talking animals have the best lines. And given that they are aiming straight at children's funny bones, they succeed in providing 90 minutes of excellent kiddie fun.<br>The laughs start early when the audience is introduced to Dr Dolittle as a child of nine or 10. At this age he holds long talks with his dog, trying to get to the bottom of why dogs sniff each other's behinds when introduced.<br>Young Dolittle goes too far and sniffs at his new head teacher's buttocks.His dad, played by Ossie Davis, knows young Dolittle's secret and sends the dog away.<br>The demons of talking to animals appear to be exorcised. But 30 years later, Dr Dolittle, a busy doctor whose practice is about to merge with a big corporation and thus make him rich, bangs his head on the dashboard after hitting a dog with his car.<br>The dog is only stunned and yells ?you butthead? to Dolittle. He understands perfectly. The next morning at a crucial business meeting, Dolittle blunders when he mistakes the voices of pigeons for that of the corporate raider who would make him rich.<br>The pigeons with the voices of Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) and comedian Garry Shandling are offering each other scraps of bread.<br>Dolittle feels he is going mad. Animals, meanwhile, spread the word that this man can help them and pretty soon the Dolittle home is besieged by creatures.Three sheep complain ?our butts hurt?, a circus monkey cannot beat the bottle, and Dolittle's own daughter's guinea pig reveals himself to be a Houdini-like party animal.<br>This all culminates in Dolittle being caught by his wife and colleagues giving a rat mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and being shipped off to a mental hospital.<br>Somewhere in there he tries to help a tiger with a worrying chronic headache and a gift for one-liners, and pays a very funny visit to the dog pound where the inmates yell ?dead dog walking? when one of their number is carted off.<br>Many critics have panned this film, but one suspects they have forgotten the childish love of anal humour and the fascination with what goes on in animals' heads.<br></font></p>
