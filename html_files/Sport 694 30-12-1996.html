            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YACHTING<br>THE lure of the sea is as old as mankind.<br>Men and women have always gone down to the sea in ships - and in yachts.<br>Yachting is one of Australia's biggest participation sports. From dingies to giant ocean racers, the pull of the sea and the compelling urge to compete draws them to the water.<br>Yachting is big.<br>Nautical terms<br>Beam: Width of the boat.<br>Beating: Sailing (or pointing) at an angle into the wind or upwind. Since yachts cannot sail directly into the wind, ?beating? is the closest course to the wind a boat can sail.<br>Burgee: A flag (normally triangular) that is the symbol of the boat's yacht club.<br>Coming about: Turning the boat so that the bow crosses through the eye of the wind, thereby changing the side of the boat on which the sails are carried. Also known as tacking.<br>Draft: The vertical distance from the waterline to the bottom of the keel; or the depth of water the boat needs to float.<br>Genoa jib: Triangular sail in front of the mast big enough that when it is properly set, it overlaps the mast.<br>Gybe (also jibe): Turning the boat so that the back crosses through the eye of the wind, thereby changing the side of the boat on which the sails are carried (opposite of tacking).<br>Jib: A triangular sail in front of the mast. Not to be confused with jibing.<br>Keel: A weighted projection from the bottom of a boat that keeps it from capsising and from slipping sideways.<br>Leeward: Used as an adjective to mean away from the wind.<br>Mainsail: The big triangular sail behind the mast.<br>Port: The left side when looking forward.<br>Reaching: Sailing with the wind blowing at approximately 90 degrees over the side of the boat.<br>Running: Sailing with the wind coming over the back of the boat.<br>Spinnaker: Big, symmetrical, lightweight sail used when reaching or sailing downwind. Also called a kite.<br>Starboard: The right side wshen looking forward.<br>Tacking: Turning the boat so that the bow crosses through the eye of the wind, thereby changing the side of the boat on which the sails are carried (opposite of jibing).<br>Windward: Closer to the wind (opposite of leeward).<br>HITS: Sources of information and statistics.<br>http://www.olyc.com/ (Online Yachting)<br>http://www.ac95.org/80/80.html (America's Cup)<br>http://www.telstra.com.au/syd-hob96/intro.htm (Sydney-Hobart 96)<br>http://www.ausport.gov.au/yacsp.html (Yachting -- Australian Sports Commission site)<br>The America's Cup<br>DATING from 1851, the America's Cup is the oldest trophy in international sport. Many consider it yacht racing's holy grail. There is no prizemoney, yet syndicates spend millions in pursuit of the cup.<br>The event is held approximately every three years. However, the 30th challenge is not scheduled until early 2000 in New Zealand.<br>Originally known as the 100 Guinea Cup, the trophy became the namesake of the New York Yacht Club's rakish schooner America, which won the trophy after defeating 14 British yachts in the All Nations Race at Cowes, Isle of Wight, on August 22, 1851.<br>The race was held in conjunction with Prince Albert's Great London Exhibition of 1851, which paid tribute to the technological achievements of the time.<br>To encourage ?friendly competition among foreign countries?, George L. Schyler, the sole surviving owner of the America syndicate, assigned the Americas Cup to New York Yacht Club through a Deed of Gift. New York YC subsequently announced it would accept challenges for the Americas Cup from any organised yacht club of a foreign nation.<br>The club successfully defended the Americas Cup 24 times over a span of 132 years, ultimately losing the ornate Victorian jug to Western Australia' Royal Perth Yacht Club in 1983, with Alan Bond's audacious Australia II challenge.<br>The Cup went back to the US after the historic 1987 series in Fremantle.<br>The winning San Diego YC then defended the Cup three times before losing it to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in 1995.<br>The Kiwis won by a stunning 5-0.<br>Results since Gretel:<br>AUSTRALIA'S first challenge was mounted by media magnate Sir Frank Packer with Gretel.<br>1962 - Weatherly (US) d Gretel 4-1<br>1964 - Constellation (US) d Sovereign (UK) 4-0<br>1967 - Intrepid (US) d Dame Pattie (Aus) 4-0<br>1970 - Intrepid (US) d Gretel II (Aus) 4-1<br>1974 - Courageous (US) d Southern Cross (Aus) 4-0<br>1977 - Courageous (US) d Australia (Aus) 4-0<br>1980 - Freedom (US) d Australia (Aus) 4-1<br>1983 - Australia II (Aus) d Liberty (US) 4-3<br>1986-87 - Stars & Stripes (US) d Kookaburra III (Aus) 4-0<br>1988 - The 27th defence is the most contentious and considered the low point in cup history. Taking advantage of San Diego Yacht Clubs indecisiveness and delays over the venue and dates for the defence, New Zealander Michael Fay issued a renegade challenge on July 17, 1987, specifying a boat double the size of a 12-metre, and demanding the race be held within the 10 months specified in the Deed of Gift.<br>The SDYC responded by building a 60-foot wing-sailed catamaran as the defender against Fay's 133-foot ?Big Boat.? It was slaughter. Stars and Stripes II d New Zealand 2-0.<br>NZ challenged the result in the New York Supreme Court which awarded the cup to NZ. San Diego appealed and the cup was awarded to them more than 18 months after the actual races.<br>1992 - America 3 d Il Moro di Venencia (Italy) 4-1<br>1995 - New Zealand d Young America 5-0<br>US skipper Dennis Conner lost the cup for the second time.<br>Sydney-Hobart<br>AUSTRALIA'S greatest blue water classic is the Sydney-Hobart.<br>The first race in 1945 attracted just nine yachts, but the event has grown to be one of the major ocean passage races in the world.<br>The 50th race in 1994 attracted a fleet of 371 yachts from around the world.<br>The course is 630 nautical miles in the Tasman Sea, down the east coast starting from Sydney Harbour and finishing at Hobart on the Derwent River.<br>With competing yachts ranging in size from 9m to 24m in overall length and in age from being just launched to timber yachts built up to 50 years ago, the fleet takes from just under three days to as long as six days to sail the race, depending on the wind strength and direction.<br>The Heroes<br>THOUSANDS of yachtsmen have sailed the Sydney-Hobart since the first small group of intrepid sailors in 1945.<br>Most have returned to ?do another Hobart?, many notching up many races, but so far only a few have been recorded by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia as having their names embossed in gold on the Sydney-Hobart Roll of Honour - a map of Tasmania cut from Huon pine - for those who have sailed in 25 races or more.<br>The race records<br>First winner: Rani (Captain John Illingworth, RN, 35' cutter, 1945)<br>Double Winners (Line & Handicap): Rani 1945; American Eagle 1972; Kialoa 1977; New Zealand 1980; Sovereign 1987.<br>Multiple winners (line honours): Morna/Kurrewa IV - seven races; Margaret Rintoul; Astor 3; Solo; Kialoa; Bumblebee IV/Ragamuffin all 2.<br>Multiple winners (corrected time): Freya 3 successive wins; Westward, Solo, Siandra, Love & War all 2.<br>Fastest race: 1975 - 2 days 14 hrs 36 min 56 sec; Kialoa - Jim Kilroy.<br>Slowest race: 1945 - 11 days 6 hrs 20 min 56 sec; Wayfarer - Peter Luke.<br>Closest finish: 1982 - Condor of Bermuda beat Apollo by seven seconds.<br>Most races by any yacht: Margaret Rintoul II - 19.<br>Record Fleets: 371 starters in 1994; 179 in 1985; 155 in 1984.<br></font></p>
