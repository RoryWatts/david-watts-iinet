            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT a relief. L.T. Kwiecinski - in a beautifully scripted letter from Mt Lawley - has soothed my aching brain cells, telling me how an auto-flush loo decides when it is time to flush.<br>Remember I was troubled last week to have stood in a public convenience with no button to push or chain to pull? The loo, governed by little green lights in plastic boxes, did it all for me.<br>L.T. Kwiecinski first saw this rampaging new technology in Innsbruck, Austria, seven years ago. Notice I have deliberately left out L.T. Kwiecinski's sex so far. He (or she) did not indicate on the letter what it was.<br>But I think we can safely assume he is a bloke. As far as I know there are no public toilets in the world where women stand, and therefore no ability for a green light to flash ?flush? at the end of business.<br>However, I do wonder if there are sitting-only toilets for men, particularly in Austria, the home of great philosophers, musicians and other thinkers. It could be just the sort of intellectual environment that promotes sitting down on the job to ponder life.<br>But back to the business at hand. L.T. Kwiecinski says his (and I really think I'm right now) understanding of the auto-flush is that it beams a little light from the plastic contraption. When that light is interrupted by a man standing in front of it, the technology takes note ... it has work to do. When the man steps away - job done - the beam of light is back to normal which is a signal to activate the flush.<br>It operates similarly to automatic-opening doors. When you cut the light beam it operates.<br>But as L.T. quite rightly points out: ?Quite clearly people who are - as the politically correct phrase has it - vertically challenged will not activate the automatic flush but I am sure that eventually that small problem will be solved satisfactorily.?<br>???<br>GEOFF WHYTE of Perth reckons the designers of our $50 note have gone a bit far. He believes the small portrait of Edith Cowan, our first woman parliamentarian, looks like the film character Mrs Doubtfire, played so funnily by Robin Williams.<br>Worse, Aboriginal inventor and author David Unaipon, whose likeness is on the other side, looks like the Melbourne footballing blabbermouth Lou Richards, according to Geoff.<br>I think he may have a point but I'm not sure. Whenever a $50 note comes into my possession it usually leaves in a hurry for the wallet of some purveyor of useless goods such as electricity, gas or water.<br>But if someone would send me, oh, 50 or 60 of them, I'd gladly join in any debate about Geoff's theory ... after I get back from Bali.<br>???<br>SMALL things amuse great minds department: Archaeologists digging (as is their wont) in Colchester, England, have unearthed what they believe is one of the world's first board games. It certainly is the first in which opening moves have been made and left on the table for posterity.<br>The Times reported earlier this month that members of the Colchester Archaeological Trust had not found any rules for the game which is described as fairly innocuous. ?It is not as clever as chess, as sadistic as Monopoly or as pointless as Patience.?<br>The archaeologists say the game is called Soldiers. The pieces were intact, with the first two moves already made. They were jubilant when they found the game and painstakingly reconstructed a diagram of what they had found, looking like a cross between draughts and tiddlywinks.<br>But then they dug up another glass counter, wrecking carefully refined theories that certain squares had been deliberately left blank as part of a clever opening strategy.<br>Now they are left puzzling why one side has XI counters and the other only X.<br></font></p>
