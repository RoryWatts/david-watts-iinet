            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOME people would hate to admit it, but it's a good thing Friday nights on Channel 7 are no longer dominated by football.<br>This gives viewers the pleasure of the company of the crusty but scholarly Inspector Morse and his kind-hearted cohort, Sergeant Lewis.<br>Morse lovers can keep up with, or even get ahead of, their hero at what looks to be the only big Web site devoted to the Oxford sleuth.<br>The Sub-Orbital site in the US was developed to provide answers to FAQs (frequently asked questions) of the TV series and the books by Colin Dexter on which episodes are based.<br>Much of the extensive content has been e-mailed by Morse viewers and readers from around the world.<br>A key area provides summaries of episodes of the first nine series between 1987 and 1996.<br>At a brief browse, it appears none of the summaries gives the game away. But it might be an idea to avoid reading too much about episodes about to go to air in case the plot is spoiled.<br>For example, tonight's Absolute Conviction has more than a screen devoted to it, making it the perfect place to relive the show and dissect the mysteries.<br>Elsewhere, the site has news about author Dexter, star John Thaw and a section of memorable quotes called Morsels.<br>Like this from Death is now My Neighbour: ?You<br>ve not lost your old skills,? volunteered Morse. ?Nah! Know what they say, Mr Morse? Old burglars never die - they simply steal away.? There is also a guide to the classical music Morse loves, plus the ability to download an audio file of the theme tune (be warned: it's big).<br>Visit: users.accessus.<br>net/ ~dr_who/<br></font></p>
