            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT DOESN'T have the big prizemoney of tennis, golf or cricket, but no one can deny surfing is a cool sport.<br>It has its own culture devoted to freedom among the waves, oneness with nature ... and boardshorts, bikinis, a unique brand of music, panel vans, bleached hair and fast or natural food.<br>Professional surfing has done much to alter the radical image of surfers. The world now has a thoroughly professional tour with stars like American Kelly Slater and our own Barton Lynch becoming readily recognised.<br>Surfing is a major pastime in Australia, California, Hawaii, New Zealand, South Africa, parts of South America and France. It has even spread to the colder waters of Britain.<br>Its roots are Hawaiian. No one knows for sure exactly where and when stand-up surfing began, but the kings and queens of old Hawaii had it perfected by the 15th century.<br>They called it he'e nalu (wave-sliding), a term adopted by ancient poets.<br>The first half of the word, ?he'e,? can mean for instance, ?to change from a solid to a liquid form?, or ?to run as a liquid?; the second part, ?nalu? can refer to the surfing motion of a wave, or the foaming of a wave.<br>And when the surfing was good old Hawaiians used to say they were hopupu (ho-poo-poo).<br>Hawaiians had prayers for good surf and a seaside hey (temple) has been found at Kahaluu Bay on the Kona coast where Hawaiian natives made offerings and prayed to their gods for good surf.<br>Of the Hawaiians who surfed, it was the ali'i or chiefly class, who claimed the highest reputation for dedicated proficiency with board and waves. They had their own prayers, chanters, board shapers, wood and beaches where they alone could surf with others of similar rank.<br>No one dared to drop in on their wave, because that meant death.<br>By the end of the 18th century, surfing had grown immensely in popularity. But the arrival of Captain James Cook and the subsequent stream of Europeanisation, particularly by missionaries, stripped Hawaii of many of its cultural pastimes.<br>However, you can't keep a good sport down and surfing, along with many other Hawaiian traditions, enjoyed a revival in the early part of the 20th century.<br>Legendary athlete Duke Kahanamoku introduced board riding to Australia at Sydney's Freshwater beach in 1915, then took it to the US in the 20s.<br>It's been popular - and cool - since.<br>World Tour<br>THE World Championships of surfing are run by the Association of Surfing Professionals, a non-profit organisation founded in 1983 to replace the International Professional Surfing tour which had run the titles since 1976.<br>The ASP World Tour provides a uniform system of scoring, judging, rating, event guidelines, and membership for surfers and event promoters.<br>The tour has two levels: The World Championship Tour (WCT) and the World Qualifying Series (WQS).<br>The WCT is made up of 12 -15 events that decide the World Professional Champion. This year, for the first time, the women's circuit will mirror the men's tour, with two tiers of competition - a world championship leg of 14 tournaments and a qualifying series of 20 contests.<br>Each tournament is filled by the top ranked men and women surfers from the previous year's ratings. Surfers compete in several rounds of one competition over five days to determine a champion for each individual event. The surfers accumulate points from the WCT events to decide an overall tour champion.<br>The tour travels a geographical pattern over a calendar year, starting in Australia, then Africa, mainland US, Europe, Asia, South America and Hawaii, where the traditional Banzai Pipeline Triple Crown concludes the year.<br>Australian men have been to the forefront since the days of Midge Farrelly and Nat Young in the 1960s. Mark Richards, Wayne Bartholemew, Peter Townend, Damien Hardman, Tom Carroll and Barton Lynch are just some who have kept the flag flying.<br>Our women<br>AUSTRALIA'S women dominate world surfing in a way no other sport can claim.<br>Wendy Botha, who migrated from South Africa but became an Aussie, and Pam Burridge shot our women to the forefront.<br>Now Australia has 14 of the top 20 ranked women surfers, eight of them in the top 10.<br>American Lisa Andersen has won consecutive world titles, but breathing down her neck is a virtual gang of Australians - Pauline Menczer, who has a world title already, Layne Beachley and Neridah Falconer the most prominent.<br>Last year Australian women won 17 of 29 finals, the best winning percentage in the history of the circuit, including eight of the 11 grand prix events.<br>Top 10 women<br>1 Lisa Andersen (US)<br>2 Pauline Menczer (Australia) 3 Layne Beachley (Australia)<br>4 Neridah Falconer (Australia)<br>5 Trudy Todd, (Australia)<br>6 Rochelle Ballard (US)<br>7 Lynette MacKenzie (Australia)<br>8 Pam Burridge (Australia)<br>10 Serena Brooke (Australia)<br>HITS: Sources of statistics and information:<br>http://www.iniaccess.net.au/surfest/profiles.html (SURFEST: Surfer Profiles)<br>http://magna.com.au/~prfbrown/the-duke.html (The Dawn of Australian Surfing History)<br>http://magna.com.au/~prfbrown/tubelink.html (Surf - Global Oceanic Surf Links)<br>http://www.asp-intl.org/ (Association of Surfing Professionals)<br>The records<br>ASSOCIATION of Surfing Professionals' records (men mentioned first):<br>Most World Championships: 4, Mark Richards, 1979-82; Kelly Slater, 1992, 1994-96; 4, Frieda Zamba, 1984-1986, 1988.<br>Most runner-up finishes: 4, Cheyne Horan, 1978-79, 1981-82; 6, Pam Burridge, 1982,1986, 1988-89.<br>Closest world title race: 80 points, 1995 (Kelly Slater d Rob Machado); 36.49 points, 1978 (Lynne Boyer d Margo Oberg).<br>Biggest victory margin: 3310 points, 1989 (Martin Potter d Derek Ho); 1914 points, 1990 (Pam Burridge d Wendy Botha).<br>Youngest World Champion: 20 years, Kelly Slater, 1992; 19 years, Frieda Zamba, 1984.<br>Oldest champion: 29 years, Derek Ho, 1993; 29 years, Debbie Beacham, 1982; 29 years, Margo Oberg, 1981.<br>Youngest winner of world championship event: 16 years, Nick Wood (1987 Rip Curl Bell's Classic); 17 years, Frieda Zamba (1982 Mazda Surfsports).<br>Oldest: 32 years, Barton Lynch (1995 Rio Surf Pro, Brazil); 29 years, Margo Oberg (1981 Mazda Surfsports); 29 years, Jodie Cooper (1993 ASP World Cup of Surfing).<br>Most victories, one season: 7, Damien Hardman, 1988; Tom Curren 1990; 7 Wendy Botha, 1989.<br>Longest running world tour events: Rip Curl Pro, Bell's Beach, Australia 1976-96; Gunston 500, Durban, South Africa 1976-96.<br>World Champions (Men first)<br>1976 Peter Townend (Australia); No official women's title.<br>1977 Shaun Tomson (S.
