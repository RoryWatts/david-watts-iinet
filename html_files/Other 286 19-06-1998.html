            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PAULINE HANSON'S One Nation Party is a disgrace, a joke. It has not tried nearly hard enough to win the hearts and minds of the people of Queensland and, through them, middle Australia.<br>If the new political juggernaut was fair dinkum it should have eclipsed the measly 23 per cent of the vote it picked up in the deep north's State election last Saturday. In the good old days Joh Bjelke-Petersen needed only 28 per cent to retain power.<br>But then he counted trees as being more relevant than people in determining the shape of electorates, so even 28 per cent might not have got Pauline's lot in.<br>What she needs are better policies, ones that will really appeal to the folks, who have quite clearly had enough from Labor and the coalition about tax reform, racial tolerance, global trade and such trifling matters.<br>Pauline has made a promising start, but needs to go much further. For example:<br>Rather than have zero immigration, why not make it negative immigration? Start deporting not just those born in other countries - particularly those dreadful Asians who work too hard - but all those who sound like they come from another non Anglo-Saxon or Celtic background.<br>Sure we will be minus Jakovich from the Eagles and Willie O from the Wallabies, Michael Klim will have to swim for someone else, and that little goodie two-shoes Natasha Stott-Despoja will have to go.<br>But then we can import our ex-pats to bolster the numbers. I'm sure Clive James, Germaine Greer and Robert Hughes would love to live in a One Nation state of harmony.<br>Just to make sure there is no immigration, we will need a very big fence around the country. It will be somewhat bigger than the rabbit and dingo fences of the outback and thus will need huge teams of labourers. Look, no unemployment! And every Aboriginal out of work will have to help construct it. As all money to Aborigines will be withdrawn, they will work for tucker.<br>And the entire population of the State of Tasmania can work on it too. They're all basket cases down there. Do them good to labour in the heat of the Pilbara or Kimberley.<br>Everyone will be armed just in case the anti-immigration fence is breached. And they will be armed just to keep the brand-spanking-new munitions industry pumping as well.<br>With barriers on all imports, we will need some thriving new projects to keep the economy on track. That way we will also be able to invest in great flag-making companies so there will be plenty of Union Jacks to wave at schools, town halls and Pauline Hanson rallies.<br>Republic? Forget it. This nation will return to traditional values, those that lit our way in the 1950s and early 60s - before hippies and pooftahs and bra-burners. When kiddies stood to attention for the Queen and said the Lord's Prayer at assembly, and if they didn't they got a damn good thrashing with a piece of cane from a demented World War II drop-out who couldn't cut it in New Guinea with a .303.<br>Ah, the good old days. One Nation policies will ensure they return. Men will be able to beat their wives with impunity after being thrown out of the pub at the new, improved closing time of 6pm. Sunday drives can be made with seven or eight to a car without seatbelts. Smoking will be encouraged, as will crewcuts, as will barefoot and pregnant women (unless they own a fish and chip shop).<br>Blue Hills and Bellbird will return to the ABC. SBS will be banned. After all it will be unnecessary after all the deportations. Oh, yes, soccer will go with it, as will watching the World Cup or even thinking about the luge or synchronised swimming.<br>And imperial honours will return.<br>Arise, Lady Hanson. Just follow the sheep to get your just deserts.<br></font></p>
