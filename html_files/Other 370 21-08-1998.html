            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF you try very hard you just might avoid tripping over Monica Lewinsky on the Internet.<br>The owner of the most famous blue dress in US history, the woman who made President Bill Clinton reveal all - sort of - to his fellow Americans this week, is omnipresent on the Web.<br>The sites range from special pages set up by the likes of CNN and the Guardian newspaper, which probe Mr Clinton's affair of the smoking trousers in the most serious of ways, to pages where testosterone-charged youths have faked nude pictures of Ms Lewinsky.<br>In between, a lot of Net users have just decided to give us their 10 cents worth and have opened pages which shout their opinion of the affair or ask other users to participate in forums about it.<br>Or they just tell rude jokes.<br>Serious as it is, even the Guardian newspaper has opened its own joke page asking readers to submit their funnies.<br>Stop me if you've heard these, but here is a tiny sample of what was on display on the Web this week:<br>l A news release from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta: The President confirms that you can get sex from aides.Q. Who was Hillary's pick to replace Monica as an intern? A: Lorena Bobbitt.Q: What is Bill's definition of safe sex? A: When Hillary is out of town.<br>But enough frivolity, the truly serious Monicaphile can learn more at the ingenious Pop-Up Monica Mania site.<br>Here you are presented with glamorous pictures of the woman who undid the president, thus almost undoing his job.If you click on a picture, a thought balloon will appear on screen with jokey ideas about what Ms Lewinsky is thinking.<br>Then there is the Monica Lewinsky Fan Club.It started out as a bit of fun but has outgrown its amateur status and found a bigger server because of its popularity.<br>The fan club touts itself as the place ?for all of us smitten by this Capitol Hill cutie to talk about all things Monica and offer our support in what are sure to be some trying times?.<br>But why take my recommendations?<br>There are several sites which offer nothing but links to pages about Ms Lewinsky and/or Zippergate.<br>One, the Monica Lewinsky Link Page, has 120 sites available. One of those sites is called the Top 100 Monica Links. Her infamy just keeps on spreading.Is it any wonder they call it the Web?<br>The Monica Lewinsky Link page:<br>www.freeyellow.com/members/plastic/MonicaLewinsky.html<br>Pop-Up Monica Mania:home.pressroom.com/jbuckley/monica/<br>Monica Lewinsky Fan Club:<br>www.tarpleyweb.com/monifan/<br>Guardian special:<br>reports.guardian.co.uk/sp_reports/clinton/index.html<br>CNN special:allpolitics.com/1998/resources/lewinsky/<br>lInternet sites are also recommended in the Web Sights column in the computer section of The West Australian on Tuesdays.They are also available on the Web at<br>www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/access/access.html<br></font></p>
