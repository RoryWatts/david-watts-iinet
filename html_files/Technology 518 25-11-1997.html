            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>WEB<br>Britannica Internet Guide<br>EncyclopaediaBritannica seems to be enjoying the brave new world of new technology. The encyclopaedia is not only on CD-ROM, it is also available by online subscription on the Web. Britannica also enjoys making special sites as it did for the Olympics and the US presidential election last year.Now it has gone into the Internet guide business with this very worthy site. The Britannica Internet Guide is a navigation service that classifies, rates, and reviews more than 65,000 sites. Britannica says its editors search the Web to identify quality Web resources.They then list, summarise and rate them in easily followed categories. Britannica claims it has a superior Web resource because ?with more than two centuries of publishing experience, Britannica brings context, structure, and a distinctive editorial voice to the Web?. If the editors are right, this site could become a de facto home page for those who want an easy-to-navigate starting point in their surfing sessions. (DW)<br>HTML<br>Web Site Garage<br>Web page authors can always do with a little help. The world of HTML and design is fraught with traps and what may appear to work on your own screen may appear like rubbish to someone else (and that's just the form, not the content).<br>Web Site Garage offers people the chance to submit the URL of their home page and have it checked - very quickly - for download time, design (HTML accuracy, really), popularity, spelling and overall ease of use. It is an impressive surface scan that delivers a full read-out of the size of every bit of the page and makes recommendations about how to improve it. For example, if your site is heavy with images, the garage offers an online service called GIF Lube which can cut sizes fairly considerably and speed up the page. (DW)<br>SPORT<br>Official Michael Jordan Web Site<br>His ?Airness? Michael Jordan has many pages, often created by adoring fans of the most recognised sportsman in the world. This purports to be the official one. It is a must-visit for those who believe Jordan deserves every million he gets, those who like sport and those curious about mega-stardom. The basic premise of the site is to present the latest Chicago Bulls game in the NBA from the Jordan perspective - how many points did he score, when and how.<br>Fans can send Jordan e-mail, there is a page devoted to fans' questions, a chat line, video, audio and pictures of the great man and the ?MJ Poll? which is a little online survey asking basketball and Jordan-related questions. (DW)<br>SOFTWARE<br>Filez<br>Do you need that Urdu translation utility for Word or maybe that obscure tool that makes your Mac look like a PC? Forget Download.Com or TUCOWS, they don't hold a candle to Filez, an interface to 5000 FTP servers around the world.If it's on the Net somewhere, it's bound to be available via Filez. Search 75 million files - and not just software either, there's movies, sounds and graphics too - in double-quick time.<br>Filez includes many corporate sites such as Apple and Microsoft, so you can be assured of the latest versions.<br>Searching for a file produces a list of available FTP locations and a brief description of the digital doozie in question.<br>Like all smart sites, it knows whether you're browsing from a Mac or PC and will tailor your search results for your platform if you want. Of course, you can always search whatever platform category takes your fancy - hello Amiga, Acorn and Atari users, are you listening?<br>Finally, it has a hierarchical index a la Yahoo where you can burrow down to narrow your inquiry to, say, graphics tools or even archives of magazines. (RP)<br>SEARCHING<br>NewsBot<br>Sometimes it's a good idea to take time to re-acquaint yourself with the sites of the Web's old guard. Newsbot, a gem on the tried-and-true Hotwired site, is a great little search engine for finding recent news.It works like this; you select the sort of news you are searching for, say politics or sport, and then specify the time frame of your search, from the past six hours to the past seven days. With the ability to select ?any category? and ?whenever? in the search criteria, you can make the search infinitely wide but the engine isn't really designed for this.Newsbot specialises in finding news that has just happened and sorting it out from the chaff of bygone eras. How many times have you been frustrated by hitting stale sites in you search for the truth online? News ?posted July 1996? generally isn't too interesting any more but one of the characteristics of the Web is that information piles up like National Geographics at the doctor's surgery. Newsbot ensures what you are looking at is fresh. (HC)<br>OOPS!Noize Net<br>Just to prove we're human at Access, we inadvertently printed the incorrect URL for local music site Noize Net last week. The correct address appears above. Happy shopping!<br>LITERATURE<br>Project Gutenberg<br>You don't get much more worthy than this. If you've been online for any length of time at all, you will have heard of Project Gutenberg, the scheme to provide all major works of literature free to the world's population in the form of electronic texts.Gutenberg has been running since 1971, creating ?Plain Vanilla ASCII? text files which can be read by just about every computer in the world.All the works available are free of copyright, so there's nothing naughty about downloading a couple of yarns that catch your fancy, printing them off and reading them at your leisure. Or, if you're a masochist, you can read them straight off your monitor.The great thing about Gutenberg texts is that, because the project started in a time of minimal computer resources, they are small. That means you can afford to keep more than a few of the reference-style books on your machine at all times for quick reference.With just over 1000 volumes available, Gutenberg has a long way to go before its selection could be called comprehensive.
