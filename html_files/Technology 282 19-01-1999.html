            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Guardian in London believes the Internet holds the key to the future for newspapers.<br>In the past fortnight, the paper has launched an aggressive campaign both online and on paper. Its highlights include:<br>?The relaunch of its Web site into several that provide 24-hour breaking news and Web-only specials, instead of simply duplicating the contents of the paper and its Sunday sister, the Observer, in HTML.<br>? Features by people as diverse as rock star David Bowie, author Irvine Welsh, and feminists Germaine Greer and Camille Paglia about the attractions of the Net.<br>? A global chat session hosted by editor Alan Rusbridger, believed to be the first time a Fleet Street editor has chaired a cyber-forum of readers. Rusbridger told The West Australian during the online chat last Friday night that he regarded the Net as an astonishing medium.<br>?Any paper which doesn't take the plunge is going to miss the boat - if you follow a watery mixed metaphor. But I think what we're doing shows a much more sophisticated understanding of the medium than some newspapers' Web sites,? he said.<br>Earlier this month, Rusbridger told the BBC that the Guardian's new range of sites made other papers' ?slightly obvious, slightly limited and slightly wrong?.<br>The concept of online newspapers as tablets of stone had gone. ?Papers that realise this are those that will adapt most ably to the Internet ... what we are doing is a quantum leap,? he said.<br>Other online executives at the paper have also emphasised what they regard as a revolutionary approach.<br>The paper has built several news sites each with the suffix ?Unlimited?. Head of new media Justin Walters said the reason behind the name was: ?Unlimited communicates the scale of the site and the casting off of the limits of print as a medium.?<br>Rusbridger explained the concept as building around the communities of interests of its readers. The paper had more Net users than any other, he said.<br>Internet editor Simon Waldman, who heads a team of 15 people working on the online papers, said the company aimed to make money from its sites in three ways.<br>?One is advertising banners and sponsorship, the second thing is e-commerce working with specific partners on transactions and the third thing is recruitment advertising. We're going to be the market leader on the Net with our jobs site,? he said.<br>Last year the paper separated both cricket and soccer news into separate sites called cricketUnlimited and footballUnlimited. Surfers had to register to use them, but the process was free.<br>The Guardian then had a reliable indicator of the sites' popularity and the profile of people using them.<br>Its overhaul this month has been to take the separations further by adding jobsUnlimited, newsUnlimited, filmUnlimited and workUnlimited.<br>Mr Walters said it was a recognition that users went to the most authoritative sites and the strategy was to make each site the best in its own market.<br>Guardian and Observer: www.guardianunlimited.co.uk<br></font></p>
