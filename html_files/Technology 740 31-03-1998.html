            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Super NoteTab Light<br>Platform: Windows95 and NT 4.0<br>Developer: Eric G.V. Fookes<br>Distributor: download from the Web site<br>RRP: Free<br>Windows Notepad is a useful tool, but severely limited. It cannot tolerate files bigger than16Kb for example, nor handle more than the most rudimentary instructions.<br>Make way then for Super NoteTab, a free text editor with incredible muscle that feels almost as light on system resources as Notepad.<br>Version 4 of the program was released last month and is the most impressive simple text editor for the PC I have seen.<br>Imagine composing a document that needed heights and weights in both imperial and metric measures. Just click on the tab at the bottom of screen marked Math (it is American after all) and you are presented with simple conversion applications that can do the sums in a jiffy.One even allows you to calculate the volume of a sphere if you have a mind to.<br>Another lets you calculate loan repayments if you know the size and term of the loan and interest rate.<br>The buttons along the bottom have a magical simplicity. They look ugly but they work beautifully and quickly.<br>One of the best is marked HTML. For all those who have taught themselves to code Web pages in Notepad, this tab will be a revelation. When you open it, there is a list of of HTML tags. A button for HTML 2.0 tags appears in a frame down the left of screen.<br>A double-click on any tag will place it in your text file. Conversely, the Edit menu allows you to remove HTML tags very quickly. This is particularly useful when you have saved a complicated Web page, but the coding obscures the text you are interested in.<br>Super NoteTab is brilliant in allowing multiple opening of documents. You may want to browse between different text files, say, different reports on the same subject.This is impossible to do easily in Notepad but NoteTab lets you open several files in the same window, hiding each under a tab until you need to click on it to open.You can open as many files as system resources will bear. Just like a Web browser, Super NoteTab also has the ability to bookmark. If you have files you use a lot, just add them to the Favorites list for one-click retrieval.<br>It can deliver statistics on how many words or characters there are in a document and even tells where there is frequent use of a word.<br>And if you have writer's block, Super NoteTab has a tab that lets you launch other applications such as Solitaire with one click.<br>There is no spell-checker but the wealth of features makes it worth a long, hard look. Or for US$5, you can buy the commercial version, Super NoteTab, which adds a spell checker, thesaurus, lets you create and edit outline documents, and provides a fully enabled command for search and replace.<br></font></p>
