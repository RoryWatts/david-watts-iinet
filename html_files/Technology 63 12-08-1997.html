            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Microsoft has not been idle in the battle of the Web browsers. Just as Netscape looked to be making comfortable headway with its fourth-generation Communicator, Bill Gates' giant tops it with the second preview or beta of<br>MSIE 4.0 is still recommended only for developers and computer professionals but it is rich in promise. It gives a very clear idea what the user interface for the next Windows operating system will look like.<br>MSIE 4.0 takes over the entire operating system, applying a browser view to all functions. Programs are underlined like hyperlinks and require just one click to activate.<br>Brave users can turn their folders into HTML documents.<br>These radical changes were made in the first beta and have not altered substantially for this release.<br>What has improved dramatically is the actual Internet Explorer Web browser. It now seems faster and smoother than Netscape, and has packed excellent new features on to its toolbar.<br>Microsoft's version of bookmark favourites used to pale beside Netscape's functionality and ease of organisation. Now it is probably better, although the user still cannot access a simple file where all the favourites are listed.<br>What you can do is click the favourites icon on the toolbar and see a list pop up in an easily manipulated frame on the left of the browser window.<br>This same easy frame can be activated for the history, the list of previously visited sites. It is a far better way to look at history than the menu on the location box, still available on MSIE and also used by Netscape.<br>The other new framed menu is Channels - Microsoft's push-technology software enabling users to subscribe to predominantly big corporate sites and have them updated.<br>Channels is a little bewildering to configure and is very buggy, just like Netscape's Netcaster. It can occupy the entire screen with a new interface while fetching sites to download and update. Then it seems to crash most of the time.<br>MSIE's Search function is the other framed menu, rolling down a list of the Web's favourite search engines.<br>Installation and configuration of MSIE 4.0 can be as infuriating as that of Windows95. The same little drum beats while you sit powerless, watching your computer fill with more than 30Mb of files from the typical 15Mb download.<br>But, overall, the browser is a treat.<br>HELP DESK<br>MSIE 4.0 home page: www.microsoft.com/ie/ie/ie40/<br></font></p>
