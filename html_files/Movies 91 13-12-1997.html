            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>Murder at 1600 (M)<br>Wesley Snipes, Diane Lane<br>Directed by Dwight Little<br>THE free world is in big trouble if what goes on at the White House in Murder at 1600 is even a quarter like what goes on in the real place.<br>Everybody at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - the president's address - is out to get everyone else and bad luck if you're caught in the crossfire.<br>Luckily action man Wesley Snipes is there in the shape of Washington homicide cop Harlan Regis to save the United States . . . and Murder at 1600.<br>For more than half its nearly two hours, Murder is a taut and enjoyable detective thriller. Unfortunately, it sinks its big budget fangs into the ripe world of cliches to complete its tale.<br>You can almost hear hero Snipes responding to directions as the climax nears: ?You really want me to crawl through a secret tunnel that I enter easily?<br>?And through the air-conditioning ducts of the White House?<br>?Oh no, not that, anything but disguising myself as the janitor, bowing my head and whistling so I'll look inconspicuous.?<br>There is a lot more. Snipes' character Regis picks up an initially reluctant Secret Service sidekick, Nina Chance (Diane Lane). She is a secret agent on White House duty because she won Olympic gold in sharp- shooting (seriously). This just happens to save Regis from certain death three or four times.<br>It sounds ridiculous, but in fact it mostly isn't. Murder at 1600 has enough vivid characterisation, exciting action, plot twists and good performances, particularly from Snipes, to overcome the assault of the cliches and the several flaws in the story line.<br>The murder victim of the title is a gorgeous blonde White House staff member.<br>Detective Regis is called in by national security adviser Alvin Jordan (Alan Alda), upsetting the White House's own security chief. Obviously a cover-up is under way.<br>The blonde was the lover of the president's playboy son and is rumoured to have even slept with the chief himself. Clues disappear into Secret Service hands. Detective Regis has much detecting to do, a fact not helped at first by the appointment of Agent ?Sharp-Shooter? Chance as his assistant.<br>She does everything to frustrate his inquiries until, in one of those instant changes of heart possible only in films, she becomes his trusted offsider, even stealing vital clues from under the noses of the Secret Service.<br>All this is played against the grim political backdrop of a hostage crisis in which North Korea has held a dozen or so American soldiers captive for months.<br>So the president has his hands full. His advisers have almost lost patience with him and the stench of murder on his doorsteps is filling his nostrils.<br>But he could fix the murder worries. If his son is such a loving boy, why can't the chief just call him in for a man-to-man to put his tortured mind at rest and clear Washington's fetid air of this foul innuendo?<br>Possibly for the same reason that Regis doesn't leak the results of his investigation and the obstruction of it to CNN.<br>There is still an hour to run for goodness sake. We need car chases, shootings, wild geese and plenty of time to crawl through tunnels.<br></font></p>
