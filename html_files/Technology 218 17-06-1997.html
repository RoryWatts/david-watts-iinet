            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Visitors to the jodi.org Web site will probably recoil in horror. They will think their hard disk is about to crash. If it's not, they could think it's revolting.<br>But the site, not the hard drive, is the revolting one. Or is it?<br>jodi.org looks like rubbish. Older computer users will be familiar with the amazing image presented of a green screen filled with orange hieroglyphics that blink.<br>This is what old systems in the late 70s and early 80s used to look like when about to crash - and they did a fair bit of that. Click on the blinking green page and you are taken to an eerie reminder of a computer screen in a B-grade movie. It's not crashing this time. But it's a crashing bore.<br>The image is grey. There are small grey boxes, labelled with jargon and flow lines between them. Click on this and you're back in crash-land, only this time it's more contemporary.<br>The screen is alive with florid colours, streaking and flashing above the skeletal images of a screen.<br>jodi.org is like no Web site I've seen. It seeks to tell the user nothing. There are no links. Indeed there is no text; none that makes sense anyway.<br>Yet it has a certain artistic appeal, like a surreal abstract. I found it because it was recommended by an art critic.<br>Ian Haig, writing at the Real Time art magazine site, delved at great length into the merits of jodi.org. He found it to be a brilliant statement against creeping commercialism and corporate sites with lookalike images and links.<br>It may be an extreme way to make such a statement but at least on the Web you can actually follow that old 60s dream of ?doing your own thing in your own time, man? (to quote Peter Fonda in Easy Rider).<br>jodi: www.jodi.org<br>Real Time: www.rtimearts.com<br></font></p>
