            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THEY'RE out there, millions of them, and it is so frustrating when you can look, but not touch.<br>They are graphic images, usually JPEGs and GIFs. The challenge is to capture them.<br>For the new user, this task looks daunting. But what is needed is guidance and patience. A good unzip program - to extract files that have been compressed to save space - will not go astray either.<br>The foundation of capturing images from the Net for personal use is a good graphics viewer program. Graphic software is available all over the Net, typically at FTP sites (File Transfer Protocol).<br>FTP sites are located all over the world and let you freely download - and upload - software for no charge.<br>Some Perth Internet service providers (ISPs) have sites with software, so it is a good idea to check with your own ISP before going on what can be a long and sometimes frustrating hunt.<br>Better programs for viewing graphics are LView Pro, Paint Shop Pro and Graphic Workshop for Windows.<br>They are all big files - over 500k - and require the aforementioned unzipping software to spring them into action on your hard disk.<br>Pkunzip.exe is as good an unzipper as any and can be downloaded at many software sites.<br>Then, if you use the URLs accompanying this, or find your own software source, it is a relatively boring matter of pointing to the program you want, prompting your system to save it and going to watch The Brady Bunch while it loads to your hard drive.<br>Once it is safely there, you will have to unzip it into its executable and documentary files ... a fast operation compared with downloading.<br>Always read the documentation, often Readme.txt or some variant thereof, for notes on how to install and use the software.<br>This file, or others like it, will tell you whether the program is freeware or shareware and you should take note so you can pay any registration fees; they are often quite small.<br>The programs not only can view a variety of different picture formats, they can convert to other graphic formats, manipulate images, cut, crop, darken, lighten or re-colourise.<br>If you are using Netscape, you can set the preference for helper applications (click on options) to launch your viewer software on download, so you can play with the image right there and then.<br>Don't neglect newsgroups. Groups starting with alt.binaries.pictures are a rich source of images.<br>Downloading is a little different because graphics in newsgroups have been encoded in the Unix-to-Unix encoded (UUE) format and if you simply download you will get hundreds of lines of bewildering code.<br></font></p>
