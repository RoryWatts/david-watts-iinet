            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A WORRIED man is at the doctor's. ?Doctor, please help. Every morning when I wake up I start singing The Green, Green Grass of Home.?<br>?Hmmmmm,? says the doc.<br>?And then every night before I go to bed I just can't stop singing Delilah. What's the matter with me?? pleads the man.<br>?Sir, you appear to have Tom Jones syndrome . . . It's Not Unusual.?<br>The former proprietor of this space, Len Findlay, can take the blame for that one. And it has nothing at all to do with anything I am going to write about today. Just thought I'd get it out of the system.<br>No, I lie. A correspondent did pass on this very brief history of medicine, thus giving the joke slight relevance.<br>Entitled A Short History of Medicine, the short history of medicine goes like this: ?Doctor, I have a stomach ache.?<br>2000BC - "Here, eat this root.?<br>1000BC - "That root is heathen, say this prayer.?<br>AD1850 - "That prayer is superstition, drink this potion.?<br>AD1940 - "That potion is snake oil, swallow this pill.?<br>AD1985 - "That pill is ineffective, take this antibiotic.?<br>AD2000 - "That antibiotic is artificial. Here, eat this root.?<br>Actually, this medical silliness is infectious. Once I got Mr Findlay's joke off the chest, and the little history, I could not resist going in search of doctor jokes.<br>Not that I think doctors are a laughing matter, far from it. Some of my best friends and relatives are doctors and they are all decent, upstanding folk.<br>The fact that the medical profession generally has more moolah than most of us poor sods who get probed by them has nothing to do with making them the butt of humour, does it?<br>Despite that, let's take the rise out of them anyway. Here are a couple of doctor jokes to pass the time.<br>A psychiatrist's secretary walks into his office and says: ?There's a gentleman in the waiting room asking to see you. He claims he's invisible.? The psychiatrist responds: ?Tell him I can't see him.?<br>Doctor, doctor what can I do? I think I'm a pair of curtains?<br>Pull yourself together man.<br>Doctor, doctor I think I'm God?<br>How did that start?<br>In the beginning there was darkness . . .<br>Doctor, doctor can I have a second opinion?<br>Of course, come back tomorrow.<br>Doctor, doctor everyone thinks I'm a liar.<br>I find that very hard to believe.<br>Doctor, doctor I feel like a pack of cards.<br>I'll deal with you later.<br>Doctor, doctor every time I drink a cup of coffee I get this stabbing pain in my eye.<br>I suggest you take the spoon out.<br>I could go on. There are thousands of doctor, doctor jokes. But the poor medicos might start having persecution complexes. So let's now fix our attention on some more easy prey - lawyers.<br>Arguably, the legal profession suffers even more jokes than the medical. As many have to do with lawyers and the devil, one can conclude that the public perception of them is pretty low.<br>A perfect target for mischief like this then:<br>The devil visited a young lawyer's office and made him an offer. ?I can arrange some things for you,? the devil said. ?I'll increase your income five-fold. Your partners will love you; your clients will respect you; you'll have four months of holidays each year and live to be 100. All I require in return is that your wife's soul, your children's souls and their children's souls must rot in hell for eternity.?<br>The lawyer thought for a moment and said: ?What's the catch??<br>Next week, we'll take the wind out of the sails of all sorts of people . . . churchgoers, husbands and the police, for example.<br></font></p>
