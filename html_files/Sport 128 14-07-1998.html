            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE weekend gave armchair sports lovers the perfect opportunity to play the silliest game in town ... that of comparing football codes.<br>What we saw probably confirmed what we knew already: soccer is the global game, rugby is war between otherwise friendly nations, and state of origin football is a battered concept beloved only of South Australians with chips on their shoulders.<br>What we on the couch should be thankful for, no matter what code or club we support, was the feast that started with The Allies v Victoria on Friday night, and ended with France shocking Brazil in the World Cup final about 5am yesterday.<br>TV drama does not get better than watching Australia hold out New Zealand for a rare rugby union win.<br>But that Bledisloe Cup match in front of 75,000 at the MCG was a shocker to watch. It was not the game's fault. Indeed Australia's 24-16 victory was among the more stirring rugby encounters of recent times, especially Matthew Burke's brilliance.<br>The coverage by Channel 7 reeked of insensitivity to viewers, however. There were ads during play, not just breaks in play. One Melbourne report said Seven stacked on 16 advertisements in the 15-minute half-time break, barely allowing Gordon Bray, Simon Poidevin or Chris Handy to get in an analytical word.<br>Considering the match was critically poised at 15-13 to Australia at the time, it was simply an outrageous act.<br>Seven had trouble of its own even before the game. The MCG's managers, the Melbourne Cricket Club, reportedly threatened to ban the network over a dispute about virtual advertising - the overlaying of sponsors' signs at the ground with other TV-generated ads.<br>It was also reported in Melbourne that the coverage was in jeopardy because the MCC demanded a share of the television money that the Australian Rugby Union and the New Zealand Rugby Union would be getting.<br>That is an extension of a drama that at one stage threatened to stop Seven telecasting AFL matches from the MCG, a row that has been resolved for now.<br>However, the MCC's pleas for the right to determine who can bring cameras to the ground they administer, and to take a slice of the revenue, even has the potential to bring Channel 9 into AFL coverage proper.<br>The immediate potential is for lawyers to take centre stage and feed on the great contests that the greatest arena in the country hosts.<br>Unfortunately, sport on TV is more and more about marketing rights and advertising than the great deeds on the field.<br>The state of origin matches showed you can still have thrilling matches despite losing champions like Peter Matera, Wayne Carey, James Hird, Paul Kelly, Chris Grant and Ben Cousins.<br>And the under-18 carnival match, won so well by WA against Victorian Metro on Saturday, showed there is a wealth of talent just waiting for its chance.<br>In one breath, the game is in good hands on the field. But in the next, never doubt that it is men in suits who are pulling the strings.<br></font></p>
