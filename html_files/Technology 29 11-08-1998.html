            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE is engineering a real revenge of the nerds on the Internet to try to keep its Communicator Web browser dominant in the war with Microsoft's Internet Explorer.<br>The innovative California company made the source code for its browser freely available to software developers this year.<br>Netscape hopes to release Communicator 5.0 this year. It hopes the cooperative, communal development will produce a browser with all the features the Net community wants.<br>In the meantime, web surfers are looking at an interim browser, the beta release of Communicator 4.5.<br>It was released in July with only a small fanfare, but it shows promise with its attention to improving the browsing experience.<br>The significant difference between 4.5 and the established version 4.0 is a feature called Smart Browsing. This feature also outdoes anything that Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 has.<br>Communicator 4.5 also reverses the alarming trend towards unwieldy download size that both browsers have shown in the past two years. It shaves about 3Mb off its packed size by integrating the old Collabra newsgroup reader with the Messenger e-mail facility, making a sensible mail and news package.<br>But it is Smart Browsing which shows the most promise. With the right development and marketing this feature could put Netscape back into revolutionary rather than evolutionary mode.<br>It might also hurt Microsoft Internet Explorer's constant erosion of Netscape's browser domination.<br>This progress has been achieved by Microsoft's production of a very good browser, but is determined more by the Seattle company's ability to put the browser into its Windows 95 and 98 operating packages, meaning there is little incentive for an average Net user to download Netscape.<br>Smart Browsing, and indeed the whole new 4.5 package, is a little unstable at the moment, given that the software is in beta mode. The trials I have done have been marred by daily crashes, lock-ups and strange browsing results. But that is what beta releases are all about.<br>Smart Browsing allows you to click a drop-down menu next to the address box which will bring up a list of sites related to the one you are looking at.<br>Possibly more interesting and more beneficial for more effective surfing is Smart Browsing's Internet keywords.<br>This feature allows a surfer to simply type a word or phrase in the address bar. They will either be taken to a site that matches their query or be given a search engine result list from which to choose a matching site.<br>For example: if you type the word Sony you will go to www.sony.com; Disney will get you to www.disney.com and so on. Best results at this stage are derived from big and mainly US corporations.<br>Typing the word Wantree - a leading Perth providers -just brings a search engine list of results.<br>However, as Netscape has an Australian presence this will no doubt change when the program is ready for full release.<br>Smart Browsing is achieved by Communicator linking to Netscape's new baby, the Netcenter, an extensive web index on the lines of Yahoo.<br>Netcenter allows Communicator to search and possibly match the keyword typed in the address bar, or to search for sites with similar keywords in the related sites feature.<br>It is a good concept that might change the present reliance on search engines.<br>Reviewers have given Communicator 4.5 a tentative thumbs-up, although it is telling that some critics still prefer Microsoft's ability to link with the whole operating system.<br>Help Desk<br>Download Communicator 4.5<br>werple.net.au/~lions/software.htm<br>Netscape Netcenter:<br>home.netscape.com/<br>Communicator 4.5 details:<br>home.netscape.com/<br>communicator/v4.5/index.html<br></font></p>
