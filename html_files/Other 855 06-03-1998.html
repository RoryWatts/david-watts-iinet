            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE thing leads to another. This sounds dumb, but is perfectly logical. Night follows day, dogs follow scents, blokes follow the Eagles or Dockers (or in misbegotten cases Collingwood) and so on.<br>The above examples lead to night following day, trees and food, and happiness or despair (particularly in the case of Collingwood).<br>Let me explain more fully with a real-life example.<br>This week I went to see the powerful Steven Spielberg film Amistad. It concerns the kidnapping of 50 Africans into slavery, their subsequent bloody mutiny and then their fight for freedom in the fledgling democracy of the United States where the court system was trying them on the basis that they were little more than salvaged livestock.<br>Their ultimate saviour was former president (the nation's sixth) and statesman John Quincy Adams.<br>As one thing leads to another, I decided to do some research on Mr Adams, played masterfully in the film by Sir Anthony Hopkins. I discovered he was the son of America's second president, John Adams, and that he signed the Declaration of Independence which came into force on July 4, 1776, and shook off the tyranny and oppression of Britain.<br>And as this thing led to another, I decided to have a sticky-beak at the declaration. A fine document it is too.<br>What ringing words are these: ?We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.?<br>Then follows a discourse about the wrongs of King George, accused, among other things, of levying taxes without representation and garrisoning armies against the people's will.<br>What's more ?He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.?<br>Thoroughly bad king all round it seems.<br>ELL one thing led to another and I was checking the TV guide before settling in for some thought-deadening passivity; my brain hurting from all the research that Amistad had provoked.<br>On offer: Oprah, Ricki Lake, Sally-Jesse Raphael, Bewitched, Roseanne, The Nanny, Seinfeld, Mad About You, Newsradio, Friends, Veronica's Closet, ER, Melrose Place, 90210 etc etc. (OK, smarties I agree these are not all on one night, but I'm trying to make a point.)<br>Eagle-eyed observers will note that this line-up is pure Americana. The Nanny, Seinfeld, Mad About You, Friends and Veronica's Closet are, what's more, all set in Manhattan, New York, a place so far removed in real life from Perth that it may as well be Iceland.<br>Now this thing leads to another. What is it with television programmers that they have to deluge us with so much American content? And why so much with such a New York-bent?<br>Some of these shows are good. Many are just humdrum. But all are plugged and marketed with appropriate deep-voiced passion by the networks. The result is a nation of viewers with more knowledge of Broadway than St Georges Terrace.<br>Isn't it time we had a look at a Declaration of Independence for TV viewers?<br>It could be along these lines: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all viewers do not live in a swish Manhattan apartment block nor a Californian condominium; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are about 50 per cent more Australian shows that display life that is relevant to us (not the whingeing of Neighbours), freedom from the stereotyping of skinny, tight-dressed bimbos and beefy, toothy blokes as role models; and the pursuit of the Happiness that comes from hearing our nasal accent rather than the nasal twang of some Brooklyn native.<br>Well one thing has led to another, and it's time to go watch TV . . .<br></font></p>
