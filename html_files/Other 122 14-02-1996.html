            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TAXIS charging flag fall when hailed off the street are a no-no and Opposition Leader John Howard clearly won last Sunday's Great Debate against Prime Minister Paul Keating.<br>How the two questions got on the same Internet ballot paper is as much as mystery as who is going to be in the Lodge after March 2.<br>But both are presented for public opinion at the Voice of Australia polling site on the World Wide Web.<br>The taxi question somehow slipped into a list of six political queries at the site, where Net users can check a Yes, No or Pass box to give their opinions about the election.<br>Jason Harrop, of Melbourne computer software firm Expression Engineering, started the Voice of Australia because, like many other Net users, he became tired of the clubby, insulting tone of messages to the Net newsgroup - or bulletin board - aus.politics.<br>Instead of one-sided raves about the flag or Mr Keating's personality, Mr Harrop wanted to test public opinion on a wide range of matters, particularly during the election campaign.<br>Net users have total control over what appears at the site. They are not only invited to respond to questions, but to submit questions on which they can then vote for inclusion.<br>This week's mini-referendums:<br>?Who won the first election debate? Mr Howard 70 per cent - Mr Keating 30.<br>?Should politicians be held fully accountable for all their political actions? Yes 91 - No 9.<br>?Do you respect Mr Keating (even if you do not like him)? No 51- Yes 49.<br>?Is a head of State a necessary component of an Australian republic? Yes 75 - No 25.<br></font></p>
