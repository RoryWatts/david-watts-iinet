            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DAVID WATTS, a denizen of the Internet, denounces plans to censor the cyberworld.<br>I WEAR an eye-patch. Some say it adds a rakish, even piratical air. I would rather look like an ageing fuddy-duddy, however.<br>The patch helps control double vision caused by an inoperable brain tumour which has also partially paralysed more than half my body.<br>The removal of the patch from my life would need something close to a miracle, something I am always looking for.<br>My main tool of research is the Internet. About 10.30pm last Tuesday I sent an e-mail to a doctor at Johns Hopkins Medical Centre in Baltimore, inquiring about developments in stereotactic radiosurgery and whether that form of treatment might hold some hope of slowing a tumour like mine.<br>First thing on Wednesday I checked my e-mail and the doctor had replied with encouraging news. I also have bookmarked Web pages at Johns Hopkins and other centres that give more details about this type of surgery.<br>That is a very personal example of the wonder of this medium. More than two million Australians experience the Net each week, mostly in a less dramatic way.<br>But with all the subtlety of a steamroller, the Federal Government has decided to censor this brave new world.<br>The reason for censorship, spelt out last month by Communications Minister Richard Alston, is to protect Australian children with methods designed ?to stop paedophiles, drug pushers, bomb makers and racists from using the Internet to spread their poison?.<br>Critics abound. They do not question the protection of children and only fools would say there is not a sewer of rubbish, or a dark side, on the Net.<br>But submission after submission to the Senate committee examining the legislation - and due to report, with what is seen as some haste, by Tuesday - points out major flaws.<br>Submissions from people like the Australian Computer Society and Electronic Frontiers Australia, among many others, say these flaws would mean:<br>?The Net in Australia would be slower and harder to access, and more expensive.<br>?Adults would be treated like children and denied freedom of choice in the privacy of their homes.<br>?Material that would otherwise be legal in other media such as books and magazines would be banned.<br>?Net content, which is mainly text and simple graphics, would be rated in the same way as film, TV and videos.<br>?An interactive medium responsible for the rapid global interchange of ideas would be treated as if it was a passive medium such as TV.<br>?Australia's future in e-commerce would be jeopardised because of the logjams the censorship regime would cause.<br>?Australia would be equated with less tolerant nations such as Malaysia (which has abandoned Net censorship anyway) and Singapore (which actually has far less intrusive censorship than that envisaged in Senator Alston's legislation).<br>?The technology intended to control access and block the nasties would be ineffective and easily avoided by the people it was designed to crack down on.<br>?There would be no change in Net content, but the measures caused by censorship would increase costs and create a new bureaucracy.<br>Submissions to the Senate inquiry are not the only place to find opposition to Net censorship.<br>An online petition, organised by the EFA, has attracted more than 10,000 signatures. Several Internet Service Providers have turned their home pages on the Web black to attract Net users' attention to the legislation. Protest marches are being organised later this month in Perth, Sydney, Melbourne and other centres.<br>Yet Senator Alston's only comment about reaction to the legislation in the past two weeks has been that it has been warmly welcomed. Cynics and critics alike point to political motives for censorship. Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine will no longer hold the balance of power in that body after June 30. The coalition will face a hostile Senate after that date and every effort is being made to win Senator Harradine's vote on key issues like the GST and Telstra privatisation before then.<br>Senator Harradine has been a driving force, indeed a moral crusader, in Senate committees inquiring into the Net and community standards over the past three years.<br>Hansard records reveal that he has been a tireless questioner about Net content and that he has, in the course of research, downloaded a lot of offensive material to prove a point that the Net is a questionable place that needs Government control.<br>Unlike the majority of other Australians he has actively sought out Net smut. In my four years experience online, this stuff does not normally come to you unbidden. The same goes double for bomb-making recipes.<br>To complicate matters, Senator Harradine says that Senator Alston's legislation is weak.<br>It appears Australia is headed for serious censorship come January 1 next year, the same day the millennium bug will strike.<br>But it is a slow business gaining a reaction via e-mail from Senators Harradine and Alston, or Labor's communications spokesman Stephen Smith, to this major intrusion in our lives.<br>Last Wednesday, I e-mailed all three. The replies started to trickle in only yesterday afternoon.<br>Clearly the doctor at Johns Hopkins, with his overnight response, was far more in tune with the so-called e-world. After all, that was a life and death issue.<br>Censorship is far murkier.<br></font></p>
