            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I'VE BEEN to cities that never close down, from New York to Paris and old London town. (Memo to self: that is quite catchy, why not try flogging it to someone like Qantas who could use it as a jingle.)<br>Where was I? New York, Paris, London . . . no, New Zealand actually. It was in 1976 and it didn't have any cities that never closed down, but it did provide some fond memories.<br>Besides the millions of sheep, there were the humans. They were so nice to Aussie backpackers, particularly in this year of the Montreal Olympics, you know the one where we won nothing at all.<br>Countless times I'd be sitting in a pub in Whydodogspoohpooh or somewhere like that when my accent would give me away and a friendly local would pounce. ?Hey Aussie, you duckheads couldn't even wen the hockey, hey.?<br>This sort of crowing about sporting victories, and about how skulful New Zealanders were in comparison with Australians, formed a permanent backdrop to drinking sessions.<br>How I wish I'd been there last week after the Australian netball sheilas beat the Kiwi nitball girls by a point in the last second. And how grateful I would be if I could get back to WA before the All Blacks do something terrible to the Wallabies in the rugby World Cup.<br>They're not bad at rugby, but they can't play a truly skilful code such as the one, true Aussie rules - mainly because any ground big enough to host footy is given over to grazing sheep.<br>Another area where New Zealand has a clear advantage over Australia is the railways. They don't have many, being a tiny, wee country, but at least what they have has rails that are all the same distance apart. For non-train people, this is known as the gauge.<br>Over here, we have different gauges in different States. This is the fault of an Irishman and a Scot. When railways were taking off in Australia in the 1850s, the colony of NSW hired an Irish chief engineer who recommended the Irish gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The colonies of Victoria and South Australia duly ordered track and rolling stock to fit that measure.<br>But before NSW made its order, it changed chief engineers from the Irishman to a Scot, who advocated the use of the growing world standard of 4 feet 8 inches, which interestingly enough is known as standard gauge.<br>Victoria and SA could not change their orders so the great railway gauge disaster had begun. Queensland added to it by complaining it did not have enough money for wider gauges, so opted for 3 feet 6 inches.<br>The standard gauge became widely popular around the world, according to encyclopedias, because it was the width that steam pioneer George Stephenson decided on when building the Stockton and Darlington Railway. It was the same width as the wagonway at Killingworth Colliery.<br>That explanation begs a few questions which I think have been answered in an e-mail that came into my possession this week and has been circulating in high places around Perth.<br>The e-mail agrees that the 4 foot 8-inch gauge was chosen because the first railway builders simply copied the width of track used in pre-railroad tramways. The people who built the tramways used the same tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.<br>That spacing was used because it allowed wagons to follow in the wheel ruts of ancient British roads. These roads were built by the ancient Romans, so why did they settle on 4 feet 8 inches, or CXLIV centimetres as they would have known it?<br>That measure was the width of a Roman war chariot. And those chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the bottoms of the two horses that towed them.<br>See, you learn something new every day. Next week I'll ponder why the Irish gauge is wider. Is it because Irish horses have fatter bottoms?watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
