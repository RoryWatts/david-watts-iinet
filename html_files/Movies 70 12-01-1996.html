            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE CRITICS:<br>Not Previewed (NP).<br>NEW RELEASE DINKUS<br>DRAGONHEART ??<br>It has the right ingredients: razor special effects, up-there stars including Sean Connery as voice of the computer-generated Draco, dungeons and dragons. But it also has a very silly plot, which goes: it's 984 AD (possibly about teatime) and old school knight (Dennis Quaid) with extra swash-buckle is teaching a prince how to wield a sword. Quaid is not to know his charge (David Thewlis) is of a new dark breed. This becomes apparent after his mom (Julie Christie) saves his life after he's gets a fatal wound in battle. How? She's got a good dragon contact who has a heart big enough for himself and the prince. Quaid and Draco the dragon become unlikely medieval chums and con artists - and that's the biggest fun in this. Daft, disarming and medium-sized fun for kids. Rated PG (HC)<br>WELCOME TO THE<br>DOLLHOUSE ????<br>The thing about traditional ugly ducklings is everybody knows that deep down there's a swan flapping to get out. The wonderful thing about Dollhouse is that it pays no attention to stereotypical tradition - and it's irresistibly hilarious, truthful and, occasionally, poignant. Dawn Wiener is one ugly duckling who's also pretty scabby to the only friend she's got. How tragic can life get in junior high? When you're universally despised by students, teachers and your parents, have the dress sense of a psychedelic Barbara Cartland and you attract the type of boy whose primary interest in you is rape, it's up there with hell. A sharp look at everyday pre-teen torture and humiliation from US newcomer Todd Solondz. Rated M. (HC)<br>SPACE JAM ??<br>This is an unashamed piece of American junk culture done with flair. The over-loud, frenetic mix of animation and real life has Bugs Bunny enlisting basketball legend Jordan's support to save Looney Tunes characters from life in an alien theme park. Predictable and crassly commercial, the kids will probably love it. Rated G. (DW)<br>FESTIVAL OF PERTH DINKUS<br>THE DAY THE SUN<br>TURNED COLD ????<br>A young steelworker walks into a police station and calmly tells a cop that his mother murdered his father - 10 years ago. When the cop, a hard-bitten chain-smoking Bogart type, asks for evidence the young man produces not a murder weapon or a bloodied item of clothing but his mother's night-time reading - a pair of incriminating crime novels. No, it's not a hard-boiled detective yarn from Hollywood but a true-life Oedipal drama set in a snowbound village in northern China, more film rouge than film noir. Still, Hong Kong writer-director Yim Ho will have you guessing right to the end as the detective struggles not only to establish the truth but understand why a son would rat on his own mother. Rated M. (MN)<br>RECENTLY OUT DINKUS<br>101 DALMATIANS ??<br>There are 101 spotted pooches in this tedious remake of the much-loved 1961 Disney animated feature and not one emerges with an individual personality. Restless parents could entertain themselves with wicked thoughts that the evil Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) does get to turn the pups into a campy, high-fashion dalmatian coat. Rated G. (MN)<br>MAXIMUM RISK ??<br>Jean-Claude Van Damme faces his most fearful foe yet - not the Russian mob, black and Hispanic thugs or corrupt FBI agents but a surprisingly ambitious storyline that requires him to act. He's on much safer ground when he sticks to teeth-rattling action, which is orchestrated by Hong Kong veteran Ringo Lam with chilling enthusiasm. Rated M. (MN)<br>STILL ON<br>DEAD HEART ???<br>There are no good guys and bad guys, no right or wrong in this tough-minded drama about a bush cop (a wonderfully gritty performance from Bryan Brown) caught between the demands of white and tribal law. Unfortunately, the film's admirable complexity tumbles into confusion as novice writer-director Nick Parsons tries to juggle too many issues, adding sub-plots that go nowhere. Rated MA. (MN)<br>A FAMILY THING ???<br>Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones being half brothers is about as likely as Pauline Hanson and Cathy Freeman are half sisters. If you can swallow this bit of ambitious casting you'll be moved by this sensitive low-key drama about a racist middle-aged Southerner who discovers he's not pure Scots-Irish but the son of a black mother he never knew existed. Rated M. (MN)<br>GO NOW ???<br>?You're ugly, you're skint, you're a four-eyed friggin' spaz.? Now is that any way to talk to a mate with multiple sclerosis? British director Michael Winterbottom (Butterfly Kiss, the forthcoming Jude) gives this disease-of-the-week TV movie a twist with some unnerving, robust humour. A lovely performance from Robert Carlyle, Trainspotting's head case Begbie, as a plasterer cut down in his prime by this most terrible affliction. Rated MA. (MN)<br>THE GRASS HARP ??<br>This gentle adaptation of Truman Capote's Deep South-set autobiographical novella about warring sisters is so moony and full of uplifting homilies that after two hours you'll be hanging out for Liz Taylor in a too-tight slip, clutching a bourbon on the rocks, to mess things up a bit. Rated G. (MN)<br>JINGLE ALL THE WAY ??<br>Arnold Schwarzenegger is badly miscast in this exuberant Christmas comedy about a mattress store owner who fights a titanic battle for the last available Turbo Man action figure. There's some spirited slapstick but Arnie's metamorphosis into a superhero offers no surprises. Rated G. (MN)<br>JUDE ????<br>Michael Winterbottom (Butterfly Kiss, Go Now) has somehow managed to freshen up that most relentlessly old-fashioned of authors, Thomas Hardy, with a lean, non-heritage visual and storytelling approach. He's helped by a sexy, un-Hardyish performance from Kate Winslet. Rated M. (MN)<br>SECRETS AND LIES ????<br>Mike Leigh has made his most accessible movie yet with this utterly convincing tale of a middle-class black optometrist who discovers that her mother is an embattled working-class white woman. An interesting companion piece to A Family Thing. Rated M. (MN)<br>THE SPITFIRE GRILL ???<br>This saccharine small-town tear-jerker about a ex-con (Alison Elliott) who puts together the pieces of her shattered young life in a small Maine town will have some rushing out of the cinema and straight into the dentist chair. What keeps us watching is the heart-breaking performance of Elliott, who manages to make even the most predictable speeches sound as fresh as a chilly Maine morning. Rated M. (MN)<br>STAR TREK ???<br>The Borg are back - not a team of robotic tennis players but a marauding race of half-organic, half-cyborg foes first encountered in the Next Generation television series. Basically a sequel to the popular two-part episode The Best of Both Worlds, this craftily plotted, visually spectacular and surprisingly sexy second instalment of the new series of Star Trek movies revolves around the initial encounter between humankind and extraterrestrials. Rated PG. (MN)<br></font></p>
