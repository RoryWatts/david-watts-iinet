            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WAS Fremantle's best win so far. The one-point thriller against Adelaide was also the best Friday night match seen on TV this year, eclipsing West Coast's eight-goal comeback against Western Bulldogs in round 10.<br>Still, some Dockers' supporters were not happy.<br>It wasn't just the terrible knee injuries suffered by Paul Maher and Luke Toia.<br>The unhappy fans watched the game on Channel 7 and did not like what they heard.<br>Their belief was the call of the game by Bruce McAvaney and Tim Watson amounted to barracking for the Crows.<br>The comments from the unhappy group were made in an Internet discussion group where the ?discussions? often get so brutally frank they make the old Footscray supporters at Whitten Oval look like a bunch of pansies.<br>In the frantic last minutes of the game, both McAvaney and Watson were shouting ?here come the Crows? or ?the Crows keep coming?. And their calling seemed slanted more to the name players of Adelaide in Darren Jarman, Mark Ricciuto and Shaun Rehn.<br>The Internet fans agreed the best part of the commentary was when the sound momentarily dropped out and boundary riders Neil (how do you think we'll go today Malcolm) Kerley and Adrian (the Dockers are in trouble) Barich had to take over.<br>McAvaney seemed genuinely thrilled at seeing the exciting Dockers' victory. As a normally excitable lad, his fervour reached new heights when Nigel Smart's snap in the last minute was judged out on the full.<br>But McAvaney is a victim of TV's love of the stars, the big names. His verbal love affair with Wayne Carey is now legendary.<br>Jason Norrish or Michael Brown may play their hearts out for the Dockers (and they nearly always do), but TV commentary will focus on Matthew Burton or Peter Mann.<br>Similarly, Ashley McIntosh will have his normally effective day at the office for the Eagles, but you can almost bet more will be said about John Worsfold or Peter Matera.<br>The lack of recognition for non-stellar WA names may account for the player of the year votes given on Friday night: Jarman first (despite arguably losing the game off his own boot with that torpedo), Ricciuto second and Fremantle's gutsy Adrian Fletcher third.<br>A similar odd set of votes was given for West Coast's typically grinding win over Collingwood.<br>The votes, announced on the Sunday morning Footy Panel, went first to Andrew Schauble of the Pies, then the Eagle whiz-kid Ben Cousins, and then Scott Crow, of Collingwood.<br>Crow got 27 or 28 possessions and kicked two goals, but had nowhere near the influence on the game as Drew Banfield, Michael Braun or McIntosh. Cousins drove his team to victory and deserved top billing over Schauble who, though he had an excellent game, merely prevented a rout.<br>?IF Adrian Barich has vowed to walk naked through the city if the Dockers win the derby next Sunday, then come on Eagles.<br></font></p>
