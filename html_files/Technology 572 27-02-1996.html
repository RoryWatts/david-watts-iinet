            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PEOPLE who have difficulty programming VCRs or cooking meals in microwaves are helping each other through a maze of Netscape, e-mail and Trumpet Winsock problems.<br>They are also debating the relative merits of newsgroups against mailing lists and taking gentle digs at BYKs (bright young kids).<br>The instrument of all this activity is Fogie Net, a subscription mailing list set up by Perth service provider iiNet Technologies.<br>Fogie Net has a fluctuating membership, but has averaged more than 100 subscribers since its inception more than a month ago.<br>iiNet said it set up the mailing list for the ?gracefully aged? in response to a request from one its own members.<br>?The list is designed for older people to help each other out with problems relating to the Internet, computers in general or how to program that VCR,? iiNet said.<br>?It is especially for people who did not meet computers till later on in life.?<br>iiNet ran an online survey last December which showed the majority of respondents were aged 30 to 50. Major Net surveys late last year revealed the average age of Internet users was 31.<br></font></p>
