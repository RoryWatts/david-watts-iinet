            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAS all been a bit of a dream. In the words of Roy and H.G. too much sport has not been enough.<br>If you were to wind back the videotape in your head - which, hopefully, has recorded this wonderful excess of sport over the past two weeks - here's what it might show.<br>Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett Favre launches a long pass in the Super Bowl. Where it falls the video cannot tell. It is the dead of night on Channel 9 and the remote has switched to the ABC's English Premier League soccer.<br>Here, Manchester United's Eric Cantona is scoring one of the five top goals of the year so far. He drives it in hard, then arrogantly struts and postures. He looks like those old newsreel shots of Mussolini. The gall of the Gaul.<br>Cantona fades and it's suddenly morning at pretty Adelaide Oval. Matt Hayden is prodding, leaving balls a millimetre outside his off stump and surviving. His maiden century summons words from the past used to describe a Tony Greig century against Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee: ?It was full of a quality that rhymes with class.?<br>Change to the Vines. The 42C heat is squashing the life out of John Daly. He gets smaller and smaller. Channel 7's commentator battery keeps guessing the temperature. It sounds like an auction. It's 38, 39, 41; sold to Peter Thomson at 46 on the fairway.<br>At the WACA Ground, the cracks are wider and deeper and the temperature and temperaments are rising.<br>Curtly Ambrose bowls Greg Blewett with a grubber, Mark Waugh is all but cut in half. Ambrose gets his bat stuck in a canyon centimetres from the crease and is run out by an adroit Ian Healy backflick.<br>Brian Lara finally lets his bat talk, but then opens that petulant mouth again.<br>The Test finishes in the mandatory three days and both channels 7 and 9 suddenly discover another football code. It's called soccer and is only the biggest, most played sport in the world.<br>Nine sends young David McGrath to Sydney to follow Perth Glory and its already legendary supporters. Seven sends Basil Zempilas and the lanky lad gets his own late-night sports show, Glory Days.<br>Fast forward a few days and Seven shows a top sporting drama. Patrick Rafter, looking beaten at two sets down against France's No.1 Cedric Pioline in the Davis Cup, gutses out a memorable victory in four hours 15 minutes.<br>The increasing blur of sport became blurrier at the weekend. Poker-faced Tom Lehman, of the US ,and smiling Wayne Grady, of Australia, were scoring lower than an Australian batsman at the WACA Ground in a high-class contest for the SA Open on the ABC. On Lehman's head sat a hat that said Dockers.<br>And on Saturday night there they were ... the Dockers, being beaten by St Kilda at Bunbury.<br>It just seems too early for footy. But they all looked fit and former Eagle Jason Heatley looked mean as he kicked four for the Saints.<br>Through it all, Virtual Andre remained rude and that silly battery kept beating Michael Chang.<br></font></p>
