            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The day of the timed call looms for Australia's more than one million Internet users - and an organised protest is being mounted on fears that affordable access is about to end.<br>AUSTRALIANS were not supposed to have timed local phone calls, if you believe the Federal Government.<br>Before last year's landslide Federal election win, the Liberal- National Opposition put it unequivocally in its Better Phones policy: ?The existing right to untimed local telephone calls for both residential and business customers will be maintained.?<br>But timed local phone calls are precisely what a growing number of people face after July 1.<br>Their imposition is in the Telstra Bills, passed by the Senate on the Wednesday before Easter to allow part-privatisation of the telecommunications giant.<br>The majority of the population will still be able to have a 30-minute natter for 25¢.<br>But local business data calls - by modem or fax - will be open to time-charging by Telstra after July 1.<br>The more than one million people who use modems to connect to the Internet - the world's fastest growing medium - fear their days of affordable access are over.<br>Most Net users pay a small business called an Internet Service Provider to access the Net through the ISP's computers.<br>Some ISPs charge hourly rates and some flat fees. WA is generally considered to be the cheapest State for such access. The biggest ISP, iiNet Technologies, charges about $35 a month for almost unlimited access.<br>Householders then pay a flat 25¢ to Telstra for the local modem call which, among thousands of possibilities, can hook them up to the British royal family's Net site, or the Washington Post newspaper on-line, or allow them to send e-mail to friends and family overseas.<br>Such calls typically last about an hour.<br>The prospect after July 1 is that they will pay much more; charges of between 5¢ and 21¢ a minute have been mooted.<br>These charges are meant to be levelled initially at the service providers.<br>Many ISPs say they will not be able to bear these increased costs and will have to pass them back to customers, both business and residential. The alternative is to go out of business.<br>ISPs say many householders will stop their Net access because of the increased costs.<br>Those who can still afford it will be driven to signing up with Telstra's own Net services, such as BigPond, which are more expensive than those provided by smaller operators.<br>On the World Wide Web of the Net, the fastest-growing area where anyone can publish their own electronic pages, timed business data calls are being called ?the death of the Internet?.<br>The Net community is in uproar. Led by ISPs, an organised protest is growing daily.<br>Web sites with historic on-line petitions have been set up, people are given the names of all senators who voted for timed calls so they can fax them and background memos on Telstra's perceived ambition to run the Net are easy to find.<br>Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston vigorously opposed a defeated Labor amendment to the Telstra Bills that would have guaranteed untimed business data calls.<br>The vote was 32-all. Beleaguered independent Senator Mal Colston voted with the Government.<br>Senator Alston defended timed business data calls during the debate by relying on Telstra claims that increasing Net use would clog the public telephone network.<br>?... there is nothing inherently wrong with imposing a cost burden on business, particularly where it reflects the underlying cost structure,? he said during debate on the defeated amendment.<br>?If they (modem calls) are taking up space on the Net and elsewhere, then one rational way of discouraging people from over-use is to make them conscious of that through the prices they pay.?<br>Early, he appeared to contradict this when he said: ? ... it is our view that a clever country ought to be encouraging residential users, particularly families and kids, who want to get on to the Internet. You do that by ... giving them a special benefit - an untimed local call.?<br>Senator Alston has not rebuffed Net users' fears that householders would suffer because of the probable cost burden on ISPs, or that hundreds of jobs could be lost through the resultant closure of small businesses, and the possible multiplier effect on companies that build modems and computers.<br>Telstra's arguments of phone congestion were given to the Senate committee into part-privatisation in February.<br>They consisted of possible scenarios including one in which Net users could leave their modem connection open indefinitely.<br>But among evidence to the contrary is this by freelance communications writer Stewart Fist:<br>The 470 ISPs in Australia have about 40,000 modems for between one million and 1.5 million Net users. These 40,000 modems impose a hard limit on the number who can be simultaneously connected over the public phone network.<br>Telstra has about 10 million subscribers, and about three million switches according to Telstra's own figures. This means that three million calls (about six million subscribers) can be connected at any one time.<br>If every ISP's modem was connected at the same time, the load on the network would only be a little more than one per cent of capacity.<br>Fist's evidence, coupled with the fact that most Net use takes place during the off-peak hours of 6pm to 2am and at weekends when the network is 95 per cent idle, appears to debunk the claims of congestion that have created the timed calls furore.<br>?
