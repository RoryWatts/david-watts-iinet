            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WEST Australians are probably lucky that pay-TV's coverage of AFL matches is not yet available here.<br>Channel 7's C7 channel, which provides AFL coverage for Optus and Austar, had an unappetising breakfast menu yesterday. At 8am it showed Hawthorn defeating Fremantle. And it aims to spoil lunch today with a replay of Saturday's Melbourne-Geelong game.<br>Real football writers in a variety of newspapers described both these matches as lacklustre. Want to know a secret? Lacklustre is a code word for a load of rubbish.<br>West Coast's six-goal defeat of Collingwood at the WACA Ground on Saturday night almost achieved lacklustre status.<br>But it was saved first by Scott Cummings' goal kicking, then by the full forward's sense of humour.<br>Channel 7 boundary rider Adrian Barich had commented to Cummings that he and Phil Matera had got their teamwork back together.<br>?Yeah, he's starting to annoy me,? Cummings said of Matera, ?always getting in my way.?<br>Cummings then joined the player huddle called by captain Guy McKenna. But at the post-match press conference he declared that McKenna never said anything intelligent and he had not tuned in to the meeting.<br>When Dennis Cometti wondered aloud on-air what McKenna's gathering was all about, co-commentator John Worsfold said it was to discuss McKenna's missed goal and the fact that he still trailed his old skipper in kicking six-pointers.<br>The team clearly has a sense of fun, which flies in the face of perceptions often held in the east.<br>One Internet discussion yesterday equated West Coast with tennis champion Pete Sampras - ?colourless and boring but gets the job done.?<br>On evidence supplied by Cummings, this is not the case. But what of the WACA crowd on Saturday?<br>It numbered 26,000 but on TV the noise level seemed strangely subdued.<br>Commentator Ian Robertson said: ?Sounds like there is a lull from here on in.? He probably meant it was a bit quiet.<br>Robertson, it has to be remembered from the week before, decided the best way to tell St Kilda's Wakelin twins apart was that one had a heavier beard growth. It took Jason Dunstall to remind him that one of the twins was wearing long sleeves.<br>Whatever he meant, Robertson was simply alluding to a fact well known by WA supporters - Eagles fans are quieter than their Dockers counterparts.<br>Supporters at the club's Internet site yesterday searched for reasons. Many claimed that the WACA Ground was not an ideal venue and shouts simply faded away.<br>The supposedly noisier Dockers fans were in need of Cummings-like light relief as they watched their side fumble and tumble to the lacklustre Hawthorn.<br>No doubt they would have dragged out the club's early motto - ?just kick the bloody thing?.<br></font></p>
