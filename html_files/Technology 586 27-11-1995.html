            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Internet has become a fount of knowledge on just about anything and everything. David Watts takes a close look at the information on offer and finds a treasure trove for lovers of trivia, particularly of the television variety.<br>THE geek shall inherit the Earth. No, not a misspelling, but a paraphrase of a Biblical quote that rings true in a world quickly becoming a global village via the Internet, a world peopled by computer enthusiasts commonly known as geeks.<br>The Net is a powerful tool ... maybe 20 million computers linked together sharing the meaning of life.<br>But hold on, what is it they are sharing?<br>I've just spent a week looking for true meaning, profound philosophy, the beauty of truth and what I know now is the floor plan for the house of Married With Children's Ted Bundy, the names of all the actors who played Doctor Who, Gilligan's Skipper's real name and all the words to the theme songs of, among other programs, The Nanny and the Andy Griffiths Show.<br>There certainly is a lot of information out there in cyberspace but if members of an advanced alien civilisation should chance on it, they'd hold both fingers to their heads, slip up to warp factor 12 and get the hell out of here.<br>As Spock - or is it Kirk? - would say: ?Beam me up Scotty, there's no intelligent life down here.?<br>I would disagree. There is plenty of intelligent life - it just doesn't know what to do with the ?intelligence?.<br>The Internet, particularly through the World Wide Web - the global network of personal and business computers sharing each other's data - is a treasure trove of trivia.<br>It may even be possible, with patience, tolerance and a week or two of sickies, to track down information on every TV show ever made, in any country, in any language.<br>The World Wide Web is not the only place for such trivia. An Internet feature known as Newsgroups enables people of a like mind to set up electronic bulletin boards where they can share opinions on their favourite topic.<br>My Internet set-up gives me access to more than 6000 such groups, many of them bizarre, fantastic or plain dull.<br>One of my favourites is aus.tv, where at least a dozen new topics a day are discussed with great passion and, at times, anger.<br>Earlier this month a curmudgeonly Yank, signing on as Ham Gravy, almost started a war between us and them.<br>He had seen The Simpsons episode set in Australia and said it showed what a great lot of dorks we Aussies really were.<br>You can't take that sort of thing lying down, so within days more than 200 irate Aussies had responded, mostly in vitriolic terms too impolite for the eyes of daily newspaper readers.<br>It wasn't just The Simpsons they discussed. The arguments accelerated to the standard of pay-TV in the US against Australia's embryonic efforts and even went into the worthiness of a country which was running out of money thanks to the Newt Gingrich-Bill Clinton feud on taxes.<br>Dear old Ham Gravy had a thick hide and despite the invective pouring like acid on him, he kept responding to Australian writers. Here is a sample of a typical electronic exchange between Mr Gravy and an Australian.<br>Ham Gravy: I don't know if you Aussies get the concept of networks. You see, there are many cities in the US and each city has local stations ...<br>Suitably irate Aussie rejoinder: Don't know if we get the concept of networks? How behind the times do you think we are? There are many cities in the US? No kidding, gee I thought the US was just a vast cow paddock with a few trees and maybe a windmill. But yes, we are more than familiar with your concept of networks. In case you didn't know, Australia is made up of many cities and towns, too. We're not just one large cattle station you know. So stick that up your jumper, Ham Gravy.<br>A great contribution to world harmony. But why are these Internauts, presumably already goggle-eyed from staring at their computer screens, getting square-eyed by watching just as much TV as it takes to rot the brain.<br>My theory is this. We all can't win the Nobel Peace Prize, or be brilliant best-selling authors, or spellbinding public speakers. But the Net gives the computer-loving population the chance to be masters of knowledge. And knowledge readily accessible throughout the world, easily disseminated, dissected, discussed and discarded is the minutia of television.<br>ALL THIS earth-shattering knowledge is delivered typically by means of a ?home page? - a document on an Internaut's computer that tells the world what they know about a certain show or shows.<br>In a week of trolling cyberspace, it became apparent fairly quickly that three shows dominate the hearts and minds of the Net community - Star Trek, in all its forms, The X-Files and The Simpsons.<br>In fact, competition among the collection of Star Treks - the Original, the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and the Voyager - is maddeningly intense. Apparently, to be a real geek these days you must like the Next Generation. Out there on the Net is the priceless document ?100 Reasons why Capt. Picard is Better than Capt. Kirk?.<br>Science fiction is by far the biggest genre covered, perhaps because active Internauts tend to be geeks - students of computer science or mathematics with an average age of 23.<br>But recent surveys in the US show that the median age of Net users is 39-44 and they are likely to be white-collar males earning close to $68,000 a year.<br>By the looks of it, they are passive viewers. And they passively ingest the following information. This example comes from a ?home page? for The Nanny, but is very like other pages about TV.<br>Photos of the cast, video clips (you can download or ?copy? these, but a 40 second clip is usually 3MB in size and can take 30-40 minutes to load from one computer to another), audio clips, a greeting in audio or video from Fran Drescher, the star, and the words to the theme song.<br>Other features common to these global fan clubs are lists of frequently asked questions about a show, episode guides and favourite quotes.<br>Occasionally the TV production company will run a ?home page? with the information but more likely it is some enthusiast who is helped in his (rarely her) quest for knowledge by e-mail input from other fans.<br>This can lead to dodgy video, audio and still-life and misleading information as well.<br>But the keeper of the knowledge remains powerful.<br>PS: The Skipper on Gilligan's Island, played by Alan Hale jun., rejoices in the name Jonas Grumby ... essential knowledge.<br></font></p>
