            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE who use it regularly know that the Internet is a wonderful medium.<br>Just the other day I was able to satisfy my lust for cricketing trivia by poking around CricInfo's archives to read scoreboards from Tests and international games played 30 to 40 years ago.<br>Then it was off to The Jester site which feeds the user 25 jokes rated on a sliding scale from Not Funny to Very Funny.<br>The clever database program then finds jokes suitable to your taste based on your reactions, and fires another 25 at you.<br>But as funny and satisfying as it is, the Net has reached the stage where more is expected of it.<br>The buzz word for 1998 has been e-commerce. The corporate cry that there is money to be made online has been around for two or three years. This year it has been very loud.<br>Last week Prime Minister John Howard released a joint statement with the US Government about the attitude and policies of both countries to e-commerce, signalling that it was on the political agenda.<br>It does not take long to find evidence of a growing desire to sell to Netizens.<br>And it also does not take long to realise that commerce in the online world is much the same as commerce in the real world - subject to human frailty.<br>Recently I was enjoying a program provided by a Perth computer retailer that allows users to mix and match hardware components on systems and find the price instantly.<br>I e-mailed them to see if anyone at the shop could come around to check out a dodgy floppy drive. (I live three blocks away but am in a wheelchair, cannot carry around PC towers and am severely hardware-challenged).<br>No reply, despite two or three repeated pleas. However, a week later a similar plea for help to a computer store many suburbs away prompted instant attention.<br>About a fortnight ago I signed up to do my banking online, falling for the hype in the TV ads that it would save me hours in queues.<br>But all I can do is see how much money I haven't got in my accounts. The bank has yet to allow transactions from the type of accounts I have - ones recommended by a flesh-and-blood bank manager in a real branch.<br>Last week I was browsing Telstra's SureLink SafeShop site where I registered with half a mind to do some Christmas shopping for books, CDs, computer goods or sporting gear online.<br>The first shop site I went to responded with the message: ?Sorry, the store you are attempting to access is temporarily unavailable.?<br>It was a bit like a ?back in 10 minutes? sign.<br>But that is the way life is. Nothing is perfect.<br>The good - or bad, depending on your perspective - side to e-commerce is that it is very easy to buy online ... if you have a credit card.<br>Good examples of the procedures involved are available at the Well Bookshop site and the ABC Shop site.<br>The Well, based in Subiaco, has been selling online since 1995, and has an excellent description of what is involved in such transactions, including the type of security employed.<br>The e-commerce bandwagon is well and truly rolling. In the next 12 months it will be fascinating to watch how many people hop on.<br>Help Desk<br>CricInfo Archives:<br>www-aus1.cricket.org/link-to-database/ARCHIVE<br>The Jester:<br>shadow.ieor.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/humor/hfilter.cgi<br>PM's statement:<br>www.pm.gov.au/media/pressrel/cooponecommerce.htm<br>Computer retailers:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/index1.html#soft<br>Bank sites:<br>www.afr.com.au/misc/webdir3.html#banking<br>Telstra Shop.safe:<br>www.surelink.com.au/shopsafe-fs.htm<br>Well Bookshop shopping information:<br>www.thewell.com.au/shopping-information.shtml<br>ABC Shop:<br>shop.abc.net.au/index.htm<br></font></p>
