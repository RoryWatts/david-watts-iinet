            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>The Baby-Sitters Club (G)<br>Ellen Burstyn, Olivia Munoz<br>Directed by Melanie Mayron<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>THIS movie is really a five out of 10 with the best of intentions.<br>But if you are aged between eight and 13, like children and, most important, are a girl, then it's nine or 10 out of 10.<br>The Essex Street cinema in Fremantle was packed with people like that at the Baby-Sitters' preview screening.<br>Many were accompanied by nice, bemused-looking dads, who, like me, appeared thankful they had, to their knowledge, never been an eight to 13-year-old girl.<br>If an equivalent audience of boys had been there to see, say the Power Rangers movie, the air would have been thick with chatter, cheers, ninja kicks and amazing body odours.<br>As it was, the girls were wonderfully behaved, sitting still for the most, rapt in attention to the screen and mostly liking what they saw.<br>Baby-Sitters is based on the wildly successful series of books by Ann Martin.<br>She's written 75 of them, and according to one American reviewer, the girls in the audience where she saw the film could recite the dialogue as it came on screen.<br>Seventy-five books about a group of seven girls looking after kids suggests there is a lot of adventure in baby-sitting.<br>Not in a boy sense though. No car chases, punch-ups, silent rituals or blood-letting.<br>The baby-sitters, because they are girls I guess, are into emotional upheaval and big secrets.<br>The acknowledged leader of the baby-sitters is a tomboy called Kristy, played nicely by the freckle-faced Schuyler Fisk.<br>She leads her six assorted - tall, short, Asian, black, trendy, earth-loving and bookish - baby-sitting cohorts to set up a summer camp for the children of their charming middle American town called Stoneybrook.<br>It looks like Peppermint Grove, or at worst, a very leafy part of Claremont.<br>We're not dealing with economically deprived kids here. But the middle classes have their own problems.<br>Kristy's separated and irresponsible dad (played by Peter Horton of thirtysomething, where he was also an irresponsible adult) returns full of promises and a dress for the tomboy Kristy.<br>No one, except Kristy's best friend and alter ego, Mary Anne (Rachael Leigh Cook), must know, and thus a web of intrigue is spun as the normally dependable Kristy starts to be late for appointments, forgets to look after her brother, and in general lets everyone down.<br>Most let down is the arty Claudia, who has failed science and will have to leave the baby-sitters - on mum's orders - if she fails her repeat exam.<br>Wouldn't you guess that Kristy is a science genius, but commitments to her dad stop her helping Claudia.<br>In the background is a juicy little romance blossoming between Stacey, a 13-year-old diabetic good-looker played by Bre Blair, and a 17-year-old Swiss exchange student who thinks she's 16.<br>Some good comic moments are had in New York, where the pair are taken for a holiday and the boy discovers Stacey's real age.<br>The summer camp is watched over by a tetchy old lady (Ellen Burstyn, who has seen better times), who you just know is going to end up saving the day and turning out lovely from the first moment you see her tending her snapdragons.<br>All in all, it's girly and yucky and nice, but I'm a balding 41-year-old.<br>My 10-year-old daughter reckoned it was pretty cool and she wouldn't mind starting a baby-sitting club.<br>So there.<br></font></p>
