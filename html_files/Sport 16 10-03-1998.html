            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HAS there been a stranger sporting act than David Coulthard's surrender of the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday?<br>Actually, yes, and, to stretch a point, there have been more than a few in the past week.<br>It all started last Thursday night on Channel 9 when the first Footy Show of the year appeared to lie down and prepare to be outrated by whatever Channel 7 had up its sleeve.<br>Why else would the debut panellists for 1998 be the wooden trio of Damian Monkhorst, Garry Lyon and Peter Everitt?<br>All are big in stature, mostly big in talent, but are a bit quiet and not the sort of troublesome talkers that got the show noticed in the first place.<br>Nine had better take that intelligent larrikin Dermot Brereton off the bench before it is too late, and Seven's new stars Jason Dunstall, Doug Hawkins, James Hird and Mick McGuane start strutting their stuff with actual AFL footage to help.<br>The Footy Show's start to the season was equally hampered by a lack of footy to talk about and the surrender to Eddie McGuire's passion for Collingwood.<br>Another strange sporting surrender was India's bowlers to Australia's lower order in the first Test.<br>They must have believed they were bowling to the Waughs and Ricky Ponting, not Ian Healy and debutant Gavin Robertson.<br>How else do you explain the last three wickets adding 155? Unfortunately, only those with Foxtel would divine more from this absorbing contest.<br>We free-to-air types find Nine is far more interested in American sitcoms like Friends.<br>A third act of abject surrender was West Coast's to St Kilda in the Ansett Cup quarter final on Sunday night.<br>The hard and fast Saints appeared to have misplaced the note that said this was an under-19 practice match.<br>The less said the better.<br>But back to Coulthard. He allowed Mika Hakkinen to pass him and win the GP because of a pre-race agreement that said whichever McLaren driver led at the first corner should not be challenged at the end.<br>The mystery pit stop that wasn't, shuffled Hakkinen back in the pack, but Coulthard stuck to the plan.<br>Wide World of Sports is running a poll asking people if they agree with Coulthard's actions.<br>Early yesterday afternoon, 78 per cent said no. It was impossible to tell how many had voted but figures were fluctuating madly.<br>What Coulthard did confirm was that the most exciting part of Formula One is the lead-up and the start.<br>Once the drivers settle into position about the fifth lap you may as well go out for a long lunch. The most interesting part left is whether Murray Walker performs one of his trademark mangles of the language.<br>But even he seemed moderate on Sunday. A strange week indeed.<br></font></p>
