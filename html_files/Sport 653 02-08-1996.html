            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE worst our men's and women's basketballers, and men's hockey team, can do is finish fourth.<br>And fourth is the pits. Athletes usually say second is the worst, but with gold, silver, bronze and a place in history, fourth is nowhere at the Games.<br>All the guts, none of the glory.<br>But in the case of the Australian basketballers there is the reward of a grateful viewing audience which has been excited by the resolve and magic of Boomer and Opal alike.<br>Talk about shaking up a competition. Now the men face the Dream Team from the US, who in reality are the bad-dream team for any non-American.<br>And our hot looking Opals, who have set tongues wagging with the figure-hugging green and gold, take on the wonder women ... the feminine Dream Team, who leave everything to the imagination in their baggy, daggy uniforms.<br>Unfortunately it's not a fashion show: so coffee cups out, night lights and heaters on, this will be historic early-morning viewing. Pray against fourth place.<br>Fourth is where US road rider Frank Andreu found himself early yesterday. Apparently the American cameramen filming the gruelling 220km race thought it worth recording every fascinating aspect about finishing just out of the medals.<br>Drew Morphett and Phil Anderson were rightly indignant that the terrific battle for the top three places between Pascal Richard, of Switzerland, Rolf Sorensen, of Denmark, and Max Sciandri, of Britain, was almost ignored to concentrate on the lone American who was really too far out to score a medal and too far in front of the stragglers to make an interesting fight of it.<br>Instead we saw lots of outriding motorbikes and cars and spectators while the real guts and glory was going on elsewhere.<br>The intrusiveness of so many cameras in athletes' faces is good and bad. In an event like the road race you worry that a camera-wielding passenger will crash into the leading bunch.<br>At the women's springboard diving all the competitors had cameras thrust at them as they climbed out of the pool.<br>This is part of modern life and tolerable for a performer who has done well.<br>BUT you had to feel for poor Jodie Rogers, of Australia, who fluffed the dive that could have kept her in the competition. She smiled at the camera that was shoved at her as she emerged dripping, but then bowed her head and retreated as the other vultures circled.<br>But the camera that displays slow-motion, head-on replays in the athletics is non-intrusive and dramatic.<br>Sprinters' cheeks wobble, their nostrils flare and you can almost see their lungs burst as they strive for the tape.<br>Except Namibia's Frankie Fredericks in his 200m heat. The 100m silver medallist looked as if he was sleep-walking as he strolled to victory.<br></font></p>
