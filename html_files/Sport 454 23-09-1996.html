            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE SHOULD take a good, hard look at our national anthem now that the Sydney 2000 Olympics are just four years minus one week away. The hype is so loud already I dread to think what it will be like with just one week to go.<br>Never mind, it pays to be prepared and one must assume that Advance Australia Fair will get a good going-over and therefore be loud and clear on millions of TV sets around the world.<br>At Atlanta it was apparent that our athletes embraced it with new-found fervour ... remember the Oarsome Foursome's loud but tuneless rendition? Skilled lip readers would have noticed, however, that anyone who sang the song came up short as the words ?our home is girt by seas? approached. It's not very rallying that line.<br>But just how much of the first verse (there are three; one of them about brave Cook sailing from Albion's shores is forbidden now) is true and fit to be included?<br>Let us examine.<br>?Australians all let us rejoice.<br>This is a fair enough start, not quite up to the Allons enfants de la patrie of the French, but better than the Jose Can You See of the Americans and well ahead of the Brits' Gossave ahh Gracious Quin.<br>?For we are young and free.<br>Not really. The Baby Boomers are ageing. The Government is taxing superannuation like never before as it becomes a money mountain to rival Scrooge McDuck's. The percentage of the population aged under 15 has dropped steadily from 21.9 to 21.7 over three years, while those over 65 has increased from 11.3 to 11.7 in the same time, says the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<br>?We've golden soil and wealth for toil.<br>Erosion and salination are massive problems in rural areas.<br>?Our home is girt by seas.<br>This is undeniably true and is as factual as the statement: ?My trousers are girt by belt?, or ?My sausages and mash are girt by plate?. This line must therefore stay.<br>?Our land abounds in nature's gifts.<br>Like funnel-web spiders, 21 of the 25 deadliest snakes in the world, crocodiles and poison-spurred platypi. Our seas are girt by white pointers, sea wasps and blue-ringed octopi.<br>?Of Beauty rich and rare.<br>See above and throw in Sir Les Patterson, Tony Lockett, any rugby league hooker and John Elliott.<br>?In history's page let every stage.<br>This is a nonsense; whoever heard of a page with a stage. It makes as much sense as the classic line: ?All the world's a stage.? To which comedian Trevor Marmalade said on TV last week: ?Well where does the audience sit??<br>?Advance Australia Fair!<br>I'm sorry but with all that has gone before, you can't expect people to swallow this line.<br>?In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair!<br>I repeat, even if you strain as the line exhorts, the veracity has now left the song.<br>This leaves us with: Australians all let us rejoice, Our home is girt by seas.<br>There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, and set to ?La Marseillaise? it would be very stirring ... a little repetitive perhaps, but stirring.<br></font></p>
