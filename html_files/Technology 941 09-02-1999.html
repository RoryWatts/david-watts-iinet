            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ABOUT eight million Australians will be among more than 300 million around the world with Internet access by the end of 2000, according to the latest surveys.<br>Both the Australian and world online populations are expected to double in the next two years, says Irish group NUA Internet Surveys.<br>NUA, based in Dublin, is cited by organisations as diverse as Yahoo, ZDNet, CNN and the Financial Times as the authoritative source for Internet demographics and trends.<br>The San Jose Mercury called it ?the place to go to when you're confused about the Internet?.<br>But NUA admits the art of estimating how many are online throughout the world is an inexact one.<br>Its Web site explains that ?surveys abound, using all sorts of measurement parameters?. From information provided by published surveys over the last two years, NUA's ?educated guess? at world Net numbers in January was 153.25 million.<br>Its figure for Australia is 4.2 million, based on an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released last November.<br>That ABS survey said 4.2 million Australian adults had ?accessed the Internet?. It did not say they were connected full-time, and presumably counted people who had used the medium only once or twice.<br>But its figures show big increases in the number of households connected - 1.24 million (18 per cent of all in Australia) in August compared with 971,000 in May and 854,000 last February.<br>NUA's prediction that more than 300 million people - and eight million from Australia - will be online in two years is based on work from the Cyber Atlas and Computer Industry Almanac organisations.<br>Cyber Atlas says that 15 countries will account for 82 per cent of world use and 25 countries will have more than 10 per cent of their population connected.<br>These figures are mirrored by the Computer Almanac, which predicts that Australia will have the world's eighth highest Net numbers.<br>It says the top countries in 2000 will be: US 132.3 million, Germany 22.9m, Japan 21.9m, UK 17m, France 12.6m, Canada 11.6m, Italy 10.6m, Australia 8m, Netherlands 5.4m and Brazil 5.2m.<br>The Almanac predicts there will be 579 million computers in use worldwide at the end of 2000.<br>NUA's breakdown of Net numbers last month reveals enormous disparities between regions, basically mirroring economic and political conditions.<br>For example, where the US and Canada are said to have 87 million people online, South America has only 4.5 million.<br>Africa has 1.14 million, one million of whom are based in South Africa. The Middle East has only 780,000 connected.<br>Although the Asia-Pacific region, with more than 26 million users, has the third highest number after North America and Europe, percentages of the population connected in countries like China and India are negligible.<br>NUA estimates that 23 per cent of Australians are online, nearly 16 per cent of New Zealanders and 15 per cent in Singapore. But only 1.5 million Chinese, or 1.5 per cent, have the Net. The take-up in India, 500,000 people or 0.5 per cent, is worse.<br>Help Desk<br>NUA: www.nua.ie<br>Cyber Atlas: www.cyberatlas.com<br>Computer Industry Almanac:<br>www.c-i-a.com<br></font></p>
