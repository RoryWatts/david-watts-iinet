            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace<br>Patrick Bergin, Matt Frewer<br>Directed by Farhad Mann<br>? ?<br>LAWNMOWER MAN 2 is the type of film that will appeal to two distinct audiences - those taking hallucinogenic drugs and those who regard Marvel Super Heroes as the epitome of classic literature.<br>Billed as science fiction this sequel to (surprise, surprise) Lawnmower Man appears to be the work of either an eccentric genius with a limited concentration span or a deranged computer nerd ... or both.<br>That is not to say it doesn't have a certain watchable charm. Presented as a jerky action comic strip, it uses some good special effects to portray the virtual world of crippled ex-lawnmowing anti-hero Jobe (Matt Frewer).<br>An opening sequence drawn straight from the TV graininess and close-up action of a US soap tries to introduce this sequel with some semblance of narrative, but instead ends up leaving the viewer confused and agitated.<br>Not as confused or agitated as they can become as the sequel proper begins to unfold, however.<br>We are taken to LA in the future, not far away, which is truly abysmal. The home of the terminally trendy is now just plain terminal. It rains, is always dark and the streets are inhabited by feral children and mad adults and patrolled by police in riot gear.<br>In this setting a group of street kids (actually they live in an abandoned subway train) try to get the most out of life by turning on to virtual reality games.<br>In one of these games they zap through sylvan settings but their leader Peter (Austin O'Brien) is grounded by Jobe, who lives mainly in cyberspace because of the horrific injuries he received in a bomb blast.<br>Jobe was the lawnmower man for Peter's family in the good old days. He was a simpleton then. Now he is a deranged genius, charged with building the ultimate virtual reality world so that the long-suffering inhabitants of the real globe can spend all their money and surrender their privacy there.<br>He is a pawn of the evil tycoon Walker (Kevin Conway) and his Virtual Light Company.<br>Jobe needs Peter to help him find the secret code to unlock the virtual reality program he is working on. That code is in the hands of reclusive genius, Dr Benjamin Trace (Patrick Bergin). Peter and his mates track Trace down - his address was on the Internet - but Jobe has tricked them. His manipulation of the code is for evil, not good, and Trace knows it.<br>So the inevitable seeds of a basic good-bad encounter are sown. The battle will be in cyberspace, great excuse for special effects and goofy dialogue.<br>It really is this silly and the acting keeps it that way. Bergin, the hero, is constantly smiling dopily or gawping at villains, but he is as brilliant as Indiana Jones in a fight.<br>Jobe is certainly a haunted villain; the way he is always brooding, then making maniacal egotistical speeches about the spirit of the world, tell us so.<br>But there it is. Director Farhad Mann thought it necessary to do a sequel and even co-write it.<br>We are left to clean up after them.<br></font></p>
