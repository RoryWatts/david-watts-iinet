            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THEATRE<br>The Hobbit<br>Stage play: Gilly McInnes<br>Director: Christine Anketell<br>Regal Theatre, Subiaco until Friday, November 5<br>Review: David Watts<br>PERTH people have been spoiled by some magical performances in recent times. Illusionist David Copperfield made members of his audience disappear. Artists in Cirque du Soleil's Saltimbanco defied gravity by climbing vertical poles while their bodies were in a horizontal position.<br>Does Company Skylark's production of The Hobbit make a trifecta? Well, yes and no.<br>The Hobbit is neither a showcase for a magician nor a circus. It is an ambitious bid to translate J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel, one of the major works of literature this century, into a short, easily understood and entertaining piece of theatre.<br>Basically it achieves this by producing a magic of its own with a stunning stage set and the brilliant puppets which are used to act out the story.<br>The lavish design and production of The Hobbit means it can be enjoyed by people who have not read the book, or its famous successor Lord of the Rings.<br>Tolkien's Middle Earth - from leafy dells, comfy hobbit holes and impenetrable forests to rocky wastelands and lonely mountains - is brought to vivid life, often with no more than the deft flick of a laser beam. The creatures which inhabit this world are puppets so imaginatively conceived by designer Philip Millar that they stamp themselves on the mind's eye.<br>If you are not familiar with Tolkien, this production's Bilbo Baggins, his dwarf friends, Gollum, the silly trolls, red-eyed goblins and Smaug the dragon are bound to make you want to read him or at least find out more.<br>If you are familiar with Tolkien and have your own special mental images of his characters, then these puppets probably will reinforce the enjoyment of a magical tale.<br>On opening night there were plenty of grins of recognition and knowing digs in the ribs when the hobbit hero, Bilbo, confronted the slimy Gollum and his riddles, for example. The line ?what has it got in its pocketss? brought much glee to Tolkien and non-Tolkien readers alike.<br>This, then, is the case for the yes vote. The extraordinary staging, design and puppetry give The Hobbit a magical quality.<br>The no vote centres on the telling of the story of Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfs to liberate their ancient gold from Smaug.<br>And it has to be said that the no is really a minor quibble in that the sweeping story, rich in symbolism and imagery, has to be dealt with so quickly that it really becomes only the briefest of summaries.<br>Writer Gilly McInnes cleverly uses Gandalf the wizard - a rare human role and one played with dignity by the experienced Sean Scully - to narrate the story and attempt to weave a rich tapestry from the snippets that will fit into two compressed acts that run for less than two hours.<br>It is ambitious and may be unsatisfying for purist followers of Tolkien.<br>As a test I took an 11-year-old who read The Hobbit recently and a 14-year-old who is about to read it, then compared their reactions with mine. I read the book about 30 years ago so a lot is lost way back in foggy memories.<br>Interestingly, both the recent reader and the soon-to-be reader were delighted by The Hobbit on stage. I was a bit ambivalent.<br>It was not so much a case of yes or no, more one of yes and maybe; just proving that Tolkien is a hard act to follow.<br></font></p>
