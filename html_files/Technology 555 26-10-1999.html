            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH man Alistair Moffat wants signed CDs, posters, guitars, exotic personal clothing, rare rock memorabilia, old back-stage passes ... in fact anything from the rock and roll world that people might want to buy.<br>He will not get a cent from any of these, and that will make him a happy man. Mr Moffat's appeal for rock goodies is central to a major Web auction called SOS, designed to help the people of East Timor.<br>All proceeds will go to Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), who have teams of doctors and aid workers in East and West Timor. ?They are struggling to supply desperately needed medical assistance to thousands of displaced people,? Mr Moffat said last week. ?They need more medical supplies and they need more help.?<br>Australian and overseas bands have already pledged donations for the auction which will run from November 8 to 14.<br>Big name donors include The Cranberries, Kylie Minogue, Regurgitator, silverchair, Corduroy, The Charlatans, Powderfinger and Grace Knight.<br>Their donated knick-knacks, and many more, can be browsed on the Web. People who want to buy or sell at the auction can register at the SOS Web site.<br>This site also has a potted history of Medecins San Frontieres, which grew out of the despair of the Biafran tragedy in 1971 and operates in more than 85 countries. It won the Nobel peace prize this month.<br>SOS auction:<br>timor.civilisation.org<br>Alistair Moffat's e-mail address (for donations):<br>minkey@webace.com.au<br></font></p>
