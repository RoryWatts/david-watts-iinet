            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE browser war may have changed battlegrounds to business-oriented Web marketing, or portals, but both Netscape and Microsoft are continuing to upgrade their products.<br>Within days Netscape will release the beta version of the Communicator 4.5, and Microsoft already has made a developer version of Internet Explorer 5.0 available on the Web.<br>Communicator 4.5 will feature major product enhancements including Smart Browsing, high performance Internet messaging through open standards such as LDAP and IMAP, and Roaming Access support for mobile users.<br>Smart Browsing is designed to allow users to find information quickly and easily by seamlessly integrating a new generation of services, hosted by the Netscape Netcenter portal site, with Netscape Communicator 4.5 client software.<br>"Smart Browsing is designed to allow users to find information quickly and easily. '<br>Smart Browsing has three main components. Internet Keywords will allow users to access Web sites by typing regular words, or simple ?keywords?, instead of specific Internet addresses.<br>What's Related will provide users with a dynamically generated list of links to information about companies, services and products that relate to the site that the user is visiting.<br>NetWatch will provide a mechanism for screening Internet content based on two PICS-compliant rating systems, RSACi and SafeSurf.<br>Web commentator Jesse Berst of ZDNet has hailed Netscape for pioneering browsing concepts with 4.5.<br>On the other hand, he recently labelled IE 5.0 as further evidence - along with Windows 98 - of Microsoft concentrating on the software engineering side of its new programs.<br>?Most of its improvements will appeal largely to developers who build on top of IE,? Mr Berst said.<br>Help Desk<br>Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 developer preview:<br>www.microsoft.com/sitebuilder/ie/ieonsbn.htm<br>Netscape Communicator 4.5:<br>home.netscape.com/communicator/v4.5/index.html<br></font></p>
