            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT returned fire quickly last week in the Web browser war with Netscape.<br>Two weeks after Netscape won industry acclaim for its version 4.5 browser, Microsoft on Thursday launched a public beta of version 5.0 of its Internet Explorer.<br>On early testing, MSIE 5.0 matches Netscape's new product for speed and features, and beats it on reliability and user adaptability.<br>Improvements to search, history, offline and bookmarking features mark the MS beta as a powerful weapon in the browser war.<br>Even if MSIE was not readily available on new Windows computers, its new features would make it almost a necessity.<br>But of course MSIE is on new PCs, giving it a vital leg-up in the battle.<br>The improvements made to version 5.0 mean that it will be hard for buyers of new PCs - when version 5.0 is officially launched - to think of good reasons to install Netscape.<br>But nothing is certain in this war. The Microsoft-US Department of Justice anti-trust case may result in MSIE having to share equal billing with Netscape on new PCs.<br>Netscape will have a version 5.0 in the next few months too. It will be produced with co-operative efforts from software developers all over the world who have been given access to Netscape's source code for most of this year.<br>Given Netscape's track record, version 5.0 is sure to be full of breakthrough features.<br>Industry analysts say that MSIE browsers usually feature incremental improvements after Netscape makes the breakthrough.<br>Maybe so, but the latest MSIE has made its incremental improvements with great polish.<br>Users now can bookmark Web pages and mark them for offline viewing. The whole page, graphics and all, is then stored on the hard disk whether a version has been cached or not.<br>This smart bookmarking will allow people who are not connected to the Net - for example businessmen using laptops on planes - to browse their favourite sites for work or play.<br>Added to this offline enhancement is the ability of the Save As command to store entire pages with graphics on the hard disk.<br>MS has sharpened the search functions introduced in version 4.0. A separate search window still opens but it now has added functions apart from the usual pane for a Web-based topic.<br>Users can specify what kind of search they want to do. MSIE then chooses what it thinks is the best search service for the request.<br>For example, if you want to find a person's e-mail address, Internet Explorer can narrow the search by using a directory service to find the address.<br>Other search categories include businesses, maps, reference, and even your previous searches. MS says that if one search provider does not give you what you need, with one click you can try another. The search options are contained in a simple box menu in the search window.<br>Bookmarking - called Favourites in MSIE - has been improved to work more in harmony with History (the tracking of visited sites).<br>MSIE 5.0 has a new Organise Favourites dialogue box that allows users to create their own list of useful sites, organised by time, alphabetically or by frequency of visit.<br>The same applies for the History folder.<br>The drop-down menu under the Location box has been given a more active role, combining with MSIE's auto-complete feature.<br>When you start typing an address in the Location box, the menu opens and suggests matches with sites you have already typed.<br>Further improvements to Favourites mean that pages that are part of a frame can be added individually, but the entire framed site will be recalled.<br>This takes care of the problem when users accidentally bookmark a useless frame such as an advertisement.<br>Help Desk<br>MSIE 5.0 beta site:<br>www.microsoft.com/<br>windows/ie/ie5/?/<br>windows/ie/ie5/main.htm<br>Alt sites:<br>Download.com:<br>www.download.com<br>TUCOWS:<br>tucows.iinet.net.au/web95.html<br></font></p>
