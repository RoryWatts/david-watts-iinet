            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE WA Internet industry and the State Government will meet to discuss the contentious New South Wales plans for cyberspace censorship which have been attacked as ignorant and draconian.<br>Paul McCutcheon, president of the WA Internet Association, says Minister for Fair Trading Cheryl Edwardes has asked for the meeting ahead of the State attorneys-general meeting on July 11 at which the NSW plans will be discussed.<br>The Australian Net community, and particularly NSW users, fears the proposed legislation announced in April by NSW Attorney-General Jeff Shaw will be foisted on all States as a model for national legislation.<br>But Mr McCutcheon believes this is a remote possibility because WA MPs and senior public servants have shown a deep interest in the Net for its positive benefits.<br>He points to the State Government's innovative use of the World Wide Web as a showcase for WA.<br>Most government departments have pages on the Web where information can be accessed and users (voters) can respond with feedback.<br>Mr McCutcheon believes it is also significant that Mrs Edwardes as the Minister responsible for censorship matters wants to hear the views of the Internet community.<br>The NSW plans have drawn outrage, not just because they would penalise adult use with heavy fines, but because Mr Shaw has been reluctant to meet Net users or even release drafts of his proposals.<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia, which has led the fight against the NSW plans, now says Mr Shaw has agreed to meet its representatives and has asked for a truce in what has become an acrimonious battle.<br>EFA spokesman Daniel Yee said in the aus.org.efa newsgroup last week that staff at Mr Shaw's office appeared to be ?rattled? by constant calls of complaint from Net users.<br>The staff had tried to paint the censorship plans as a broad attempt to tackle paedophiles and not ordinary users.<br>However, many correspondents to aus.org.efa responded angrily, describing the statements as lame excuses and more evidence of State ignorance of the true nature of the Internet.<br>Mr McCutcheon says WA MPs, senior public servants and Net users all had similar aims with the Net, emphasising its positive sides and encouraging children to use it as an educational medium.<br>The WAIA, like the Government, did not oppose censorship, Mr McCutcheon said. But both opposed ?bad censorship? which stopped full and proper use of the Internet.<br>The overthrow of the Communications Decency Act in the US two weeks ago also was a good omen against introduction of the restrictive NSW plans as an Australia-wide Net censorship model.<br>Although Australia had no constitutional right to free speech as the US did, and which was the lynchpin of the American CDA decision, ?wise heads? here could see the benefits of the Philadelphia ruling.<br>The key finding by Judge Stewart Dalzell was: ?Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.?<br>URL:<br>http://www.multiline.com.au/~kheit/<br></font></p>
