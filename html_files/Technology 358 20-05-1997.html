            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA WILL not be overwhelmed by northern hemisphere Web sites if two Curtin University computer students have their way.<br>Dale Carter and Naveen Yawanarajah, both 28, are operating the Gateway to Perth site from St James.<br>GTP indexes the growing number of WA corporate Web sites in easily-followed categories. More than 530 sites are online and this figure is growing by three a day.<br>The number of visits to GTP is also growing. The operators estimate 2000 a month now and say visits doubled in January, and again in February.<br>Big search engine Lycos recently rated GTP as one of the best information booths about Perth on the Web.<br>?We felt that it was all well and good to have these massive search engines that could find thousands of Web sites on one topic, but we felt that many people also wanted local information,? Mr Carter said.<br>?People want information about their city including the availability of products and services. It's also about building a sense of community and the Internet seems to be very quickly building one of its own.?<br>A unique Web wedding service sets GTP apart from many of the usual index services. It was created by 21-year-old Curtin student Natalie Dodd, and allows newlyweds with overseas or interstate family to share their wedding experience, including photos, extracts from speeches and audio greetings.<br>?We provide great tips on selecting everything from a string quartet to the very important wedding stationery,? Mr Carter said.<br>Mr Yawanarajah says GTP is trying to become the most extensive business directory for Perth.<br>?We want to give buyers the best opportunity to shop around for products, and businesses the best opportunity to promote the advantages of their products and services. We see the Internet as connecting buyers and sellers faster and more efficiently than any other medium,? he said.<br>Clients range from the Red Cross blood transfusion service to Curtin University Student Guild.<br>A feature of the site is a random link that sends surfers to unknown business destinations in WA.<br>???<br>THE WA Internet Association will throw itself open to the public again next Tuesday night. The association is hoping for a repeat of public interest which saw more than 70 attend its inaugural open meeting in February.<br>Two developments that WAIA regards as exciting will be major topics on the agenda. One is a WAIA-sponsored peering exchange - where local Internet providers can share traffic to reduce costs and improve performance.<br>The other is a joint move by WAIA and the legal faculty of Notre Dame University, to set up an independent Internet arbitration panel where users and access providers can resolve differences.<br>Guest speakers at the meeting will be Max Joynes, from the WA Department of Premier and Cabinet, and David Bennett of Cisco Systems.<br>Mr Joynes is responsible for Internet policy within the State Government, and will discuss the Government's plans for its Internet presence and projects it has in place to make information more accessible.<br>Mr Bennett will discuss how the new 56k modem technology works and its impact on the Net access industry.<br>The meeting will be at 6.45pm at the QV1 Conference Centre, Level 2, 250 St Georges Terrace. WAIA says RSVPs can be e-mailed to rsvp@waia.asn.au.<br></font></p>
