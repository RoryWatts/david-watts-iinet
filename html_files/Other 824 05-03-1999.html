            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I RANG my twin brother Duncan the other day to check whether he had recovered from watching the eclipse while wearing two eye-patches.<br>Me: Hello mate, how's it going?<br>Twin: G'day. The cuts and bruises are nearly gone. But I have to keep taking the nerve pills.<br>Me: It was a nasty fall, wasn't it?<br>Twin: Yeah, couldn't see a thing with the eye-patches.<br>Me: So what else is news?<br>Twin: Well Shirl (his wife) and I have made a very big decision. Can you keep a secret?<br>Me: Of course not, you boofhead, I'm a journalist.<br>Twin: May as well tell you. We're going to have a baby.<br>Me: Terrific, when?<br>Twin: January 1, 2000. It will be one of those Millennium Bubs that Pam Casellas wrote about in Inside Cover the other day. We're very excited but truthfully I don't know if I can perform, mate.<br>Me: Why would you say that?<br>Twin: Well, after reading what Pam had to say, then consulting the Baby Due Date Calculator on the Internet, Shirl and I are agreed that April 9 and 10 are the perfect days to have a . . . Me: Naughty boy, you can't say that word in a family newspaper.<br>Twin: Sorry, you know, the perfect dates to conceive a child so that it has a better than average chance of being born on January 1, 2000.<br>Me: Still can't see the problem, unless it's with the definition of millennium. You know that January 1, 2001, is the real start of the new one. January 1, 2000, would be fine if the calendar started at year zero, but it doesn't.<br>Twin: Stop going on. And I know that January 1, 2000, marks the start of another 1000 years so, strictly speaking, there's nothing to stop us calling it the start of a new millennium. But that's not why I'm a little apprehensive.<br>Me: What's the big deal?<br>Twin: April 9 and 10 are right at the start of round three in the footy, mate. I don't know if I can get away from the set for long enough. The footy's very important you know. But Shirl has her heart set on a Millennium Bub. I can't disappoint her. What should I do?<br>Me: Gee, it's a hard one; see your problem mate. Why not let Shirl take the initiative? Take her to a couple of games. Once she sees big, boofy blokes in tight shorts whacking the hell out of each other and taking screamers and all that, she's bound to come over all hot and steamy and she won't be able to keep her hands off you even if you're just lying guts-up on the sofa and guzzling from a stubby and shouting ?in the back ya drongo?.<br>Twin: Well I will be, but that sounds like a good plan. There's one problem though.<br>Me: What now?<br>Twin: The players don't wear tight shorts like they used to. Even Benny looks baggy. I don't know if she'll be hot enough.<br>Me: Listen, be positive. Make April 9 and 10 nights to remember and you're certain to have a baby on January 1.<br>Twin: But a Millennium Bub, lots of couples will want them, and there'll be overcrowding in the maternity wards on January 1, and when the fathers go out to get the extra cash they'll need for flowers and choccies the ATMs won't spit out any because of the Millennium Bug. The scenario is getting frightening.<br>Me: Obviously you're going cold on the whole idea. You'll just have to do something that will repulse her and keep all amorous thoughts at bay on those days.<br>Twin: Got it . . . I'll tape over our wedding video with the start of round three.<br>Me: Geez you're brave. But a man's gotta do etc.<br>Twin: I know, well cop you . . .<br>Me: Enough, seeya.<br></font></p>
