            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">VICTORIANS, who needs them? Not even Victorians it would appear, judging by the results of that State's recent election.<br>If you could name one man who has epitomised Victoria for the past five years or so - you know, big, arrogant and loud - it would have to be Premier Jeff Kennett. And now he is in danger of being tossed out by his own kinsmen who see him as a bit of a boofhead, possibly because he was over-confident enough to go to the polls in the middle of a football finals series.<br>Well, he is a Hawthorn barracker and obviously had nothing better to do with his time in September because his once mighty team is now good enough only for stringing together a few surprise wins at the end of the season.<br>I don't necessarily hate Victorians. Some of my best friends and fondest memories live there. Then again, the friends all moved there from respectable parts of the country and the memories are only memories. But I still don't hate Victorians. Loathe is perhaps a better word.<br>Did you know that the National Australia Bank recently offered its customers free access to the Internet to help them bank online? A great move - but only bankers in Melbourne (and Sydney, and don't get me started on sin city) need apply.<br>We in God's Zone, and those less fortunate than ourselves in Queensland, South Australia and that funny little place where they grow apples, cannot connect to the NAB's chosen Net provider because it operates only in Melbourne and Sydney.<br>Did you ever wonder about the benefits of cable TV? Over here in paradise we help make Rupert Murdoch rich because the choice is Foxtel cable . . . or Foxtel satellite.<br>There are a couple of other pay-TV operators out there, however. And they happen to offer sport channels that are not dominated by snowboarding, wrestling and American college gridiron. Austar and Optus carry C7 which shows real footy several days a week and Sheffield Shield cricket and which is the main telecaster of national soccer and that means oodles of Perth Glory games.<br>If you lived in Melbourne with all those loathsome, spotty Victorians you could watch all that.<br>You could also be in line to try the latest, greatest and fastest telecommunications technology on offer from Telstra, cable modems that would deliver all the joys of the Net before your heart skipped a beat.<br>Again it's the Victorians who benefit, not we who have chosen to defend the vast bulk of the continent.<br>But when you get down to it, it is the footy that brings out the worst in the Vics. They are glorying in the fact that tomorrow the MCG (and what a patched-up, painted joke that has become) will be the venue for the first all-Victorian AFL grand final since 1995 and the first all-Melbourne one since 1993.<br>Last Sunday, the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr George Pell, even told the congregation that his prayers for the third annual football mass had been answered because ?there is no interstate club in the grand final?.<br>Dr Pell may be aware that this divine intervention was helped by the AFL deciding to hand genuine contenders Brisbane one day fewer to rest than Melbourne-based teams; by making it play the Kangaroos at that side's favourite time of the week (Friday night), and for good measure handed out some suspensions at the tribunal to eliminate star Brisbane players.<br>And those Vics made our Eagles play a ?home? game at the MCG . . . again.<br>And they stole our Mick Malthouse and made him parade around like a Hollywood star when all the time we have known he is just a normal bloke with a penchant for journalists on toast.<br>I hope it rains on their grand final and that the only people under cover are those unfortunate enough to be visiting the place.<br>Ah Victorians . . . they can all go to Pell.<br></font></p>
