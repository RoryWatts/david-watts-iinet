            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS fashionable on the Internet to refer to comprehensive Web sites as the ultimate. There is the Ultimate Band List and the Ultimate TV List, for example.<br>If the same theory were applied to software, Catch.UP would deserve the tag of ultimate helper.<br>The program works as a scanner application plugged into your browser, and can be activated only from its parent Web site.<br>It interrogates your hard disk to see what programs you have, then scours the Net for new versions or fixes. It returns a Web page listing available upgrades.<br>It does all this in less than two minutes.<br>Traditionally, users had to connect to several different software libraries and check higgledy-piggledy lists of the latest additions.<br>Catch.UP now does nearly all of it, making waiting for the download the most laborious part of an updating exercise.<br>The only time-consuming action is the initial set-up when you have to mark the programs on your hard disk that you want checked for newer versions.<br>Catch.UP does not automatically download programs, leaving that choice to the user.<br>Manageable Software Services which developed Catch.UP aims to provide accurate, dependable and timely updates for thousands of different software versions. Catch.UP is at www.manageable.com/<br>execute.html.<br></font></p>
