            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT TAKES an earthquake or an Oklahoma bombing to get the World Wide Web shaking. The tragedy of Britain's mad cow disease crisis, though earth-shaking, is simply not Web-shaking.<br>Links to sites with information and news about mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) are few and far between.<br>But attempts are being made to draw enough links together to make the flesh creep.<br>Martyn Overy, head of science at North Chadderton School in ldham, Lancashire, has done the best on BSE so far. His site has comprehensive links to a variety of medical topics, including genetic engineering and chronic fatigue syndrome.<br>He has eight links to mad cow disease including ?Watergate of the meat industry? and an article from The Vegetarian magazine ?Mad cow put me off meat for life? by Professor Richard Lacey.<br>???<br>APPLE Powerbooks, digital cameras and satellite gear are grinding their way slowly up Mt Everest to take the Internet population to the roof of the world.<br>Every frigid step of a South African expedition's attempt on Everest is being beamed on to the World Wide Web by staff of the Sunday Times of Zambia.<br>They have created a colourful Web site, rich in frames and graphics, to chart the climb.<br>More than 80,000 Web surfers have followed the South Africans in the first fortnight. They are able to follow their progress in the Himalayas right down to health reports - some of the team have altitude sickness and pneumonia.<br>The Sunday Times site offers profiles and pictures of the climbers plus digital pictures from the scene. Surfers can talk to the climbers by e-mail and join a discussion group as well.<br>???<br>THE Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has put its Job Guide on the Web.<br>The department is using the new Education Network Australia (EdNA) site, aiming to give young job-seekers as well as students access to job information in as many media as possible.<br>The Job Guide is available as a book and is on CD-ROM as well as being available on the Web.<br>It allows users to search for information on jobs by alphabetical listing or broad interest and tells them how and where to apply as well as qualifications needed.<br>Finding your way there...<br>Mad Cow WWW site - http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/MJOvery/topic.htm#Mad<br>C Everest site - http://www.web.co.za/everest/text.htm<br>Virtual jobs site - http://www.edna.edu.au/cgi-bin/nph-jobguide<br></font></p>
