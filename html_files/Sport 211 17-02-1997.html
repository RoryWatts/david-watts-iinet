            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BOXING is brutal but has strange beauty. Men die in the ring, yet writers like Norman Mailer or Damon Runyon eulogise the fight game.<br>It makes millionaires of some and corrupts others. It turns petty ghetto crims into household names and conmen into influential people.<br>The Encyclopedia Britannica says the earliest evidence of boxing as a sport is found in the Mediterranean area from about 1500BC. The Greeks introduced it to the Olympics in the late 7th Century BC. Greek boxers used thongs of soft leather to bind their hands and forearms.<br>Later in Rome, the leather glove was exchanged for the cestus, which was studded with metal, and gladiatorial boxing matches usually ended with the death of one contestant.<br>The sport declined with the late Roman Empire and no further reference to boxing exists until modern times when it was revived in London in the 18th Century in the form of bare-knuckle prizefights.<br>The first boxer to be recognised as a heavyweight champion was James Figg in 1719. In 1743 a later champion, John Broughton, formulated a set of rules standardising some practices and eliminating others, such as hitting opponents when they were down or seizing opponents by the hair.<br>The Revised London Prize Ring rules were drawn up in 1853 and they controlled the sport until the end of the 19th Century, when the Queensberry rules came into use.<br>These were drafted in 1857 by a boxer, John Graham Chambers, under the auspices of John Sholto Douglas, 8th Marquis of Queensberry. They emphasised boxing skill rather than wrestling and agility over strength.<br>The last bare-knuckle heavyweight champion was the American John L. Sullivan in 1889.<br>Sullivan lost the world heavyweight boxing championship to James J. Corbett in New Orleans, Louisiana, on September 7, 1892. The first great period of boxing popularity began in the 1920s as a result of the American promoter Tex Rickard, with his million-dollar gates.<br>Boxing in all weight divisions remains popular, but the heavyweight championship dominates.<br>When great boxers are spoken of, the names of the heavyweights - Dempsey, Marciano, Louis, Liston, Ali and Tyson among them - are most likely to be mentioned.<br>Divisions<br>THERE are 17 recognised weight divisions, but a majority of professional boxers compete in only eight of those.<br>Flyweight: 50.7kg<br>Bantamweight: 53.5kg<br>Featherweight: 57.1kg<br>Lightweight: 61.2kg<br>Welterweight: 66.6kg<br>Middleweight: 72.6kg<br>Light Heavyweight: 79.4kg<br>Heavyweight: 88.5kg and over.<br>Who runs it?<br>IN England, modern professional organisation began with the Pelican Club (founded 1887), superseded by the National Sporting Club (1891). The British Boxing Board of Control (1919) effectively replaced the National Sporting Club after 1929. In the US, the National Boxing Association was founded in 1920 and was renamed the World Boxing Association (WBA) in 1962.<br>US dominance of the WBA led to the formation of the rival World Boxing Council (WBC) in 1963. Both sponsored championship fights and the recognition of champions.<br>Both the WBA and the WBC began naming rival champions from 1965 (with occasional agreements). Another professional organisation, the International Boxing Federation, was founded in 1983.<br>And to confuse matters there are at least four other groups claiming world champions, including the World Boxing Organisation and the World Boxing Union.<br>World champions<br>Division: IBF, WBA, WBC.<br>Heavyweight: Michael Moorer, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis.<br>Cruiserweight: Adolpho Washington, Nate Miller, Marcelo Dominguez.<br>Light Heavyweight: Virgil Hill, Virgil Hill, Roy Jones Jr.<br>Super Middleweight: Roy Jones Jr., Frank Liles, Robin Reid.<br>Middleweight: Bernard Hopkins, William Joppy, Keith Holmes.<br>Junior Middleweight: Terry Norris, Laurent Boudouani, Terry Norris. Welterweight: Felix Trinidad, Ike, Quartey, Pernell Whitaker.<br>Junior Welterweight: KOSTYA TSZYU (Australia), Khalid Rahilou, Oscar De La Hoya.<br>Lightweight: Philip Holiday, Gusshie Nazarov, Jean-Baptiste Mendy.<br>Junior Lightweight: Arturo Gatti, Choi, Yong Soo, Azumah Nelson.<br>Featherweight: Naseem Hamed, Wilfredo Vazquez, Luisito Espinosa.<br>Junior Featherweight: Vuyani Bungu, Antonio Cermeno, Daniel Zaragoza.<br>Bantamweight: Mbulelo Botile, Daorung Siriwat, Wayne McCullough.<br>Junior Bantamweight: Danny Romero, Alimi Goitia, Hiroshi Kawashima.<br>Flyweight: Mark Johnson, Saen Sow Ploenchit, Yuri Arbachakov.<br>Junior Flyweight: Mauricio Pastrana, Keiji Yamaguchi, Saman Sorjaturong.<br>Strawweight: Ratanapol Sor Vorapin, Rosendo Alvarez, Ricardo Lopez.<br>¦ Four other boxing groups claim world champions. The heavyweight crowns are worn by Henry Akinwande (WBO), George Foreman (WBU), Riddick Bowe (WBB) and Adilson Rodriguez (WBF).<br>Coming bouts<br>February 22: Atlantic City, New Jersey<br>Arturo Gatti v Tracy Patterson (IBF Lightweight Championship)<br>Angel Manfredy v Wilson Rodriguez (WBU Super Featherweight Championship)<br>March 1: Paris, France<br>Jean-Baptiste Mendy v Steve Johnston (WBC Lightweight Championship)<br>Regilio Tuur v Pierre Lorcy (WBO Junior Lightweight Championship)<br>March 15: Las Vegas, Nevada<br>Michael Moorer v Vaughn Bean (IBF Heavyweight Championship)<br>April 5: Hamburg, Germany<br>Dariusz Michalczewski v Virgil Hill (WBO Light Heavyweight Championship)<br>May 3: Las Vegas, Nevada<br>Evander Holyfield v Mike Tyson (WBA Heavyweight Championship)<br>On screen<br>BOXING is a major theme in 119 movies, according to the Internet Movie Database which has details of more than 50,000 films.<br>Some memorable, if not always great, films featuring boxing:<br>Rocky to Rocky V<br>Raging Bull<br>The Champ<br>The Main Event<br>The Great White Hope<br>On the Waterfront<br>The Joe Palooka series<br>The Prizefighter<br>Tyson<br>The greatest<br>US sportswriter Don Sibrel, in a comprehensive history of the fight game, listed who he considers the 18 greatest heavyweights.<br>They are:<br>1.

George Foreman<br>(Sibrel brackets Liston, Tyson and Foreman under a single title, The Beast: ?These three epitomise the tough-guy mystique the heavyweight championship is supposed to stand for. All three spent a good deal of their lives on the wrong side of the law (only Foreman was eventually able to turn things around), and all three delighted in terrifying opponents into virtual submission before the first bell.?<br>6.
