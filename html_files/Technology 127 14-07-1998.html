            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LAST week I learnt about the fax of life. As the spelling suggests this education was not at somewhere like the tasteful Sexuality Bytes site run by Channel 9 on the Web.<br>This was a less sensuous lesson and, like much in home computing these days, directly linked to Microsoft.<br>It was all to do with Windows 98, the operating system which is now three weeks old and still causing great discussion.<br>The most asked question, judging by observations of threads in newsgroups and the chatter in e-mail discussion groups, is whether it is worth upgrading to.<br>As we know the hype for 98 has barely been hype at all, especially when compared with the fits Microsoft had with Windows 95.<br>As many also know by now, that lack of hype is justified because 98 is far from revolutionary, offering instead a more reliable platform than 95 and occasionally a faster one ... provided you have at least 32Mb of RAM and a Pentium 133. Following the debate on whether to upgrade inevitably leads to disgruntled users letting off steam. One such thread last week concentrated on fax. At first sight, that does not look touchy at all, yet it generated far more heat than any other 98-related discussion I have seen.<br>But it is a good sign for Microsoft that a utility like fax, and not system integrity, is causing waves. It means that perhaps the Seattle giant has a reasonable if unremarkable OS on its hands.<br>Back to the fax. The initial query that started all the discussion about whether 98 is worth getting was in a Perth newsgroup and went roughly like this:?Okay, I give in ... for the life of me I couldn't find the fax components ... I tried to send a fax from Word only to get an error saying Mail not installed. Mail for fax? How logical.<br>?Nonetheless, I couldn't find any reference to that in the Windows Setup section of the Add/Remove Programs control panel either. Windows Help was less than helpful, saying how to view and edit faxes, but not how to send and receive them.<br>?As for Win 98 support on the Microsoft site - on clicking on the Support button on the Win 98 home page, one gets: HTTP Error 404.?<br>The responses ranged from ?read the manual? (RTFM in e-mailspeak) to ?stick to Linux?. At one stage there was nearly a virtual brawl with one correspondent threatening to punch another in the nose (down the phone line presumably). But eventually it was discovered that the new 98 does have the old Microsoft fax, but it is buried deep on the installation CD-ROM in a file called Tools/Oldwin95/Message/US/Awfax.exe.<br>Very simple really. But if you have the Outlook 98 e-mail and general organisation program, it also has fax capabilities. To get them you have to connect to the Windows Update site on the Web and request the Symantec WinFax Starter Edition. This then downloads and installs itself automatically and allows users to send faxes as if they were sending e-mails. But they work best if fax numbers are in the e-mail address book.<br>When a fax number is typed in the To: field of an e-mail form, the address must be in the form fax@phone number.<br>It is all so simple ... not. Users might be better advised to install a fully functional third-party fax program.<br>And those are the facts of life.<br></font></p>
