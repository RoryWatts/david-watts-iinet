            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A LOT that happens at this time of the year is silly, which probably explains why it is called the silly season.<br>Take the Barmy Army . . . please.<br>Thousands of English lads and lasses have followed their cricket team's fluctuating fortunes during this Ashes summer. The ?soldiers? seem harmless and fun-loving. And the army's page on the Internet shows its members love the game to bits.<br>They have published some priceless quotes by observers of the great game. One by the late BBC commentator Brian Johnston should be framed and put over every fan's TV: ?The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey.?All the same I am looking forward to the day when the Barmy Army hops it.<br>There are just so many hours that you can listen to the chant ?Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army . . .? I got my fill about mid-December.<br>There is one collective not getting its fill - the Hungarian Government. I doubt that the boys in Budapest will ever be troubled by the Barmy Army, there being a shortage of good wickets in the country.<br>But Hungary's tax office was recently given the power to arm a special unit with cattle prods, Mace and handcuffs . . . which actually could be handy in keeping the Barmy Army quiet.<br>About 30 per cent of Hungary's gross domestic product comes from the black market and the Government wants to find ways to bring smugglers and other tax cheats into the fold.<br>Someone who is obviously getting more than his fill is Russian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, often called Mad Vlad.<br>Mr Zhirinovsky was shown on TV news bulletins recently parading voluptuous half-naked women before the cameras. His mission: to stimulate Russia's sex drive to make the economy sexually-oriented.<br>The man who describes himself as ?the sexual knight to all the girls of Russia? proposed State-sponsored sex as the answer to the country's crisis.<br>In a book called the ABC of Sex, Mr Zhirinovsky urges Russian men and women to increase their sexual output and abandon monogamy. Forget that it is too freezing to stand in a queue at the department store: get down and get dirty, he says.<br>Each woman should have at least one man, preferably two, but ideally three: a sex knight, a husband and a young lover, he writes.<br>And to relieve stress among Russia's beleaguered astronauts he proposes sending prostitutes into space. Prostitutes should also be licensed to the army and to prisons.<br>He goes on with more of this rubbish, designed to put him back in media focus with Russia's young male voters before the next elections. None of his theories is really that surprising given that pictures of him wearing only underpants are plastered on the Net (not a pretty sight). I've even seen one of a fully-clad Mad Vlad presenting a totally naked young woman with a big hat.<br>It is difficult from this distance to say how far Mr Zhirinovsky will get with his proposals. If he tried them in the Starr-Clinton-Lewinsky-obsessed US, he would be in for a harder time without doubt.<br>In the town of Kenosha, Wisconsin, for starters, there is a council by-law which states: ?No male is allowed to be in a state of arousal in public.?<br>In Milwaukee, an old law forbids parking for more than two hours unless a horse is tied to the car. This no doubt gives rise to the phrase ?horsing around?.<br>Just by the by, it is also against the law to play a flute and drums on the streets to attract attention, or to be in public during the day if you are ?physically offensive looking?.<br>And in Little Rock, Arkansas, the city where Bill Clinton rose to political prominence, a bye-law says ?flirtation between men and women on the streets may result in a 30-day jail term?.<br>Good thing he went to Washington.<br></font></p>
