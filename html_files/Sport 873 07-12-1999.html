            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT'S great to barrack for Australian sporting teams at the moment.<br>We add the Davis Cup to world championships in one-day cricket, netball, women's hockey, rugby league and rugby union.<br>In fact, there is so much green and gold success about, it moved the Guardian newspaper in London yesterday to quip: ?The world must now pray that they don't seriously take up football (the real round-ball version, that is). And a word of warning: they were only denied the under-17 World Cup of that sport last month when they lost the final to Brazil in a penalty shoot-out.?<br>Yes, it's great to barrack for Australia, but does that necessarily include the commentators?<br>Listening to Channel 7's team at the Davis Cup final in Nice was what it might be like hearing Eddie McGuire doing a Collingwood match.<br>But it was hardly a surprise. John Alexander, John Fitzgerald and co have always put Australia first in tennis. Very few of our players have surnames when talked about on screen, come to think of it.<br>On Sunday night, the Seven team - like John Newcombe's own men - had everything to play for. And Fitzgerald, in particular, made sure everyone knew he was 120 per cent behind Mark Philippoussis.<br>Well before the Scud beat Cedric Pioline in the first set, Fitzgerald had him marked as one of our tennis greats.<br>He could do little wrong even when Pioline played some breathlessly good tennis to take the second set.<br>And as Philippoussis stuck to his brutally, graceful game (how does such a big man seem to glide so easily?) Fitzgerald was even telling newspapers the headline for the match. It was ?coming of age?.<br>Thanks for the suggestion Fitzy. As it turned out he was right in every hyperbolic thing he said about Philippoussis.<br>The Scud played marvellous tennis against a very good opponent fired up by a frenzied home crowd.<br>He ended up tearing Pioline to shreds and left him crying at the drama and emotion of another French loss to Australia in a major sporting event.<br>It made marvellous television, far better than the normal Sunday night fare of movies. Philippoussis was also good enough to wrap things up before 11.30pm, so no late night or agonising about the result.<br>Apart from Fitzgerald's hyperbole and the match itself, a highlight was the Nice crowd. That's Nice pronounced niece, not nice.<br>Surprisingly none of the commentators appeared to say the atmosphere was absolutely electric. They nearly always do even when it's not ... and this time it was.<br>According to a translation I performed with the help of an Internet program, the Nice Matin newspaper had this to say about the hometown crowd at the weekend: ?The French who profit from an unconditional support for residence, will have had an enormous evil to draw on ...?<br>Allez whoops.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
