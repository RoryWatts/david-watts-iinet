            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BLAME it on 87, the devil's number of Australian cricket. Channel 9 estimates 87,000 Perth people tuned in to its live coverage of Australia's pursuit of the West Indies' miserable 110 late on Sunday night.<br>The last action many would have seen came around 12.15am yesterday when Michael Bevan and Steve Waugh took a sharp single to take the score from 87 to 88.<br>Even hardy souls who stayed up until the 30th over at 12.45am would have assumed that Australia, at four for 94, would polish off the Windies in four or five more overs.<br>But a replay on Foxtel yesterday morning revealed that Bevan and Waugh took another 10.4 overs to pilot Australia to the next stage of the World Cup, probably drag the Windies with them ahead of New Zealand, and pick up two points as well. Strategy, cool calculation and deadly boredom reigned as Waugh tried to ensure his team made the most of the rules.<br>A packed Old Trafford yawned at first, then jeered mercilessly.<br>Matthew Engel, the editor of Wisden, commented: ? ... the tournament disappeared up its own rear end. Some have thought the complexities of the qualification system unfathomable. Yesterday, the Australians fathomed them, and the result was a dreadful and shameful game of cricket.?<br>The only consolations were Australia's brilliant bowling, headed by Glenn McGrath, and the fact that many of the 87,000 Perth viewers popped off to bed before the calculator ruined the game.<br>They also would have appreciated missing Tony Greig's explanation for Australia's go-slow. Not that there was anything wrong with it, just that it was the only thing to talk about.<br>In fact, Greig could have explained Einstein's theory of relativity twice in the time it took Australia to win.<br>Nine was pretty happy with its audience for the game. It says that an average of 193,000 saw the demolition of the Windies. The audience reached its peak at 8.15pm when 233,000 were watching.<br>The annual AFL holiday also enabled Nine to pick up respectable figures for that funny EJWhitten legends' game on Friday night.<br>It estimates 214,000 watched, compared with 175,000 who chose Seven's movie, Pulp Fiction - proof perhaps that in the absence of Friday night football, we will watch anything that resembles footy. Curiously, the devil's number was also at work for Seven and the unloved (by the public) state of origin match on Saturday.<br>The station says 87,000 people tuned in to watch 26,000 people huddle at the MCG while Victoria put its foot on South Australia's throat.<br>Seven's Jamie Martinovich said that figure represented nearly 54 per cent of the total TV-watching audience at the time. By comparison, last week's AFL game between Carlton and Melbourne at the same time of day drew 137,000, or 76 per cent of the audience. These figures are becoming as coolly calculating and boring as Waugh's.<br>Friday's return of AFL football and its associated tribalism cannot come soon enough.<br>Neither can a fair dinkum effort in the World Cup.<br></font></p>
