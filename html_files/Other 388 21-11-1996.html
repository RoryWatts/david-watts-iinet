            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT State election? The December 14 poll has been almost totally ignored by the estimated 50,000-60,000 people who use the Internet in WA.<br>The Federal election campaign at the beginning of the year stimulated dozens of Net sites on the most popular part of the medium, the World Wide Web.<br>The Howard-Keating battle also drew hundreds of people into often fiery discussions each day in the newsgroups - electronic bulletin boards.<br>But Richard Court v Geoff Gallop seems to enthrall practically no one.<br>The newsgroup aus.politics attracts up to 200 e-mail posts a day, discussing every aspect of government in the land.<br>This week there has been a grand total of one post talking about the WA poll. And that was from an American asking what the issues are.<br>On the Web, Labor has made a slight move. The WA branch has a State election page.<br>It is in its infancy but will grow, says the party. So far there are lists of candidates and contacts within the party (though no e-mail addresses).<br>And there is a page promising major speeches, although only one was featured by yesterday. It is by Dr Gallop on the plight of battlers, made before the election was called.<br>There is no sign of a Liberal presence. The main Australian Liberal Party site has no mention of a WA election. In fact, the page still presents the same format it had in February - coalition policies and membership details.<br>WA's Australian Democrats also have a Web site. It oozes confidence, saying: ?Democrats in Western Australia are confident of gaining the balance of power in the Legislative Council and providing the same benefits to the people of Western Australia and parliamentary debates and process as they have done in the Federal Senate.<br>?When the Democrats are successful, they will break a stranglehold of a century of conservative domination of the State House of Review.?<br>Late yesterday, the Democrats had their education policy online.<br>One of the few sitting MPs with an Internet presence is Greens (WA) MLC Jim Scott, but his page has not caught up with the election. Its last offering is a September 23 speech about smog.<br>The oddity in cyberspace is former Liberal candidate for Moore, Paul Stevenage, who maintains a Web page, but it has not been updated since February 19 and still calls Mr Stevenage the Liberal for Moore.<br>Addresses:<br>WA Labor Party:<br>http://www.wa.alp.org.au/election/<br>State Government media releases:<br>http://www.wa.gov.au/cabinet/mediast/<br>Australian Democrats (WA):<br>http://www.democrats.org.au/wa/<br>Paul Stevenage<br>http://www.iinet.net.au/liberal<br>Jim Scott:<br>http://www.pegasus.oz.au/<br>jimscott/welcome.htm<br></font></p>
