            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE wonders whether there is any need now to go to a game of international cricket.<br>For the price of a constant stream of advertisements and commentators mangling the language, Channel 9 makes Tests and one-day matches more intimate and exciting than you could hope to experience at the ground.<br>The Scott Muller ?can't bowl, can't throw? affair became an incident only because ground microphones used by Nine picked up the comment.<br>What could the TV boys have up their sleeves for future coverage?<br>Perhaps an appealometer could be dragged out in a bid to measure the sincerity of appeals, particularly those for lbw. The snickometer already does the job for caught behind appeals.<br>We can see what we like with the snickometer. If it is an Australian batsman, then the bat brushed the pad. If he's from the opposition, definitely a thin top edge.<br>Appealometers could be graded from ?testing the umpire?, through ?I'm desperate for a wicket?, to ?worth a shout?.<br>Then we could have the sledgometer, an effects microphone that picks up comments between opposing players.<br>Rather than letting Tony Greig or Ian Chappel put their words into bowlers' mouths, we at home will finally be able to tell whether Glenn McGrath is actually inquiring about a batsman's health, or his parentage.<br>The slagometer will be similar to the sledgometer, but cunning use of technology will enable it to pick up comments aired between teammates.<br>Then viewers will be able to form their own opinion about team spirit and harmony.<br>It won't matter that out on the field international cricketers are trying to do their job like any other super-normal human being.<br>With the wonders of technology and the pressure of ratings-driven revenue, they will be more like TV stars in family viewing time and expected to act accordingly.<br>UNFORTUNATELY, viewers in Perth didn't get to see a lot of these TV stars in the third Test, courtesy of a particularly bruising Australian performance.<br>But the four or five hours we did see was mouth-watering.<br>Thanks to the much talked about baggygreen.com.au or ABC radio, fans would have seen the writing on the wall about 2.30pm on Sunday when Pakistan was 7-233.<br>We got five minutes of play when Nine crossed at 3pm, then the presentations, but no dismissal replays or highlights.<br>Luckily, it was a lovely day outside.<br>The lack of cricket on Nine was more than made up for by Seven's earlier coverage of the Australian Open golf.<br>The effects microphones didn't pick up anything unseemly, although it would not have been surprising to hear someone say of the scowling Colin Montgomerie, ?can't chip, can't putt?, at certain times.<br>No one would have uttered any but good words about winner Aaron Baddeley.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
