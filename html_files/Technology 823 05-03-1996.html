            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE House on the Hill is now the House on the information highway. The WA Parliament went live on the Internet last month with a commitment to spread democracy in cyberspace.<br>In a simple, but effective World Wide Web site, Parliament is presented with a picture of the House in all its night-time glory.<br>Lists of Members of the Legislative Assembly and Council are given and are available in Adobe PDF format for ?picture perfect electronic copies of documents?.<br>Phone and fax numbers are given for MPs, but there are no e-mail addresses. Hyperlinks are used to take browsers to Ministers' biographies and pictures, and there is a link to the Web home page of Greens MLC Jim Scott.<br>At least one MLA, Whitford Liberal Rob Johnson, has an Internet site of his own.<br>The Parliament site links to another new one for the State Government - the Commission on Government.<br>URL: http://www.wa.gov.au/parl/<br></font></p>
