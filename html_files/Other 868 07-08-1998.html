            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS all the fault of my mate Michael. The other night he turned up to dinner dressed in entirely new clothes. None of the other four blokes noticed, or they did not say anything to suggest they had noticed. Until one of the six GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums) piped up during the coffee: ?Haven't you noticed Michael's new clothes? They are Country Road; great shirt, lovely pants.?<br>Michael blushed and said: ?I'm still wearing my old school belt though, and these are the favourite shoes out of my three pairs.?<br>The GYMs then quizzed him about whether he had a new jacket, new tie, or even intended having his hair cut. ?I think Rex Hunt was a bit severe on Polly Farmer at the western derby lunch,? was all Michael would say.<br>Blokes are not good at clothes and hair and things. The most the rest of us would utter when told - with GYMs you are seldom asked - to admire Michael's new get-up was: ?Yeah, new hey, good.?<br>This probably explains why blokes do not seem to have book clubs. In my experience they are entirely female gatherings. And I don't think literature is the exclusive topic at any book club night.<br>It is not that blokes don't appreciate books. Far from it, men read voraciously. And though many chaps are excellent at putting their thoughts on paper - witness James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck - the bulk of us are not very good at letting it out in group discussions.<br>Can you picture a blokes' book club? Host bloke: ?Right tonight we're going to discuss Robert Drewe's The Drowner.?<br>Another bloke: ?Yeah, any chance of a beer. I'd like to do some drowning.?<br>Other blokes: ?Yeah.?<br>Host bloke: ?But what did you think of the book??<br>Other blokes: ?Beaut, good stuff, not bad, any chance of a beer??<br>Host bloke: ?Here you go. Yeah, good book. Hey the footy's on, anyone want to watch??<br>Other blokes: ?Yeah, beauty.?<br>All blokes: ?Lewie ... beauty.?<br>A short and sweet night for all concerned. Compare this with a real book club whose proceedings I inadvertently eavesdropped on the other night:<br>Host GYM: ?Okay girls we all read Jack Maggs by Peter Carey. I thought it was exquisite, full of beautifully reconstructed Dickensian language and characters with a delicious plot that included a fascinating, if slightly weird love story.?<br>(See one GYM has already said in one sentence more words than a company of blokes could string together).<br>Another GYM: ?I'll have a chardonnay sweetie ... yes, exquisite stuff by Carey and the love story reminded me of when Jemima was chasing that dreadful rogue with the wandering eye.?<br>Jemima: ?I was not chasing him; anyway I had more luck then you did. Is that chardonnay fattening? I might stick to the decaffeinated tea and the non-creamy cream on my fat-free asparagus tips thanks. What about Julia's new hairdo??<br>Julia: ?Yes, only $85 and it matches the tights and belt I bought to go with the little black dress I bought to help me get over that dreadful rogue you all seem to have got on so well with.?<br>I'll chop it off there. You get the picture. It can go for hours or at least until the chardonnay has disappeared. Sometimes the book might even get more than a passing mention.<br>A FEW rules of life passed on by Internet correspondent Garfield last week:<br>?Never take life seriously. No one gets out alive anyway"; ?One good turn gets most of the blankets"; ?There are two kinds of pedestrians - the quick and the dead"; Life is sexually transmitted"; ?Shin - a device for finding furniture in the dark?.<br></font></p>
