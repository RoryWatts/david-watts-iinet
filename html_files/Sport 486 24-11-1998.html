            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IAN CHAPPELL will wake up one day and realise he is no longer captain of Australia.<br>We all know he stood aside for brother Greg back in 1975-76. But someone forgot to tell Chappelli, who still ?leads? the side from the Channel 9 commentary box.<br>Yesterday afternoon Chappell was full of his own opinions about when the real captain, Mark Taylor, should declare Australia's dashing second innings.<br>Co-commentator Tony Greig, another former captain, preferred to put forward an objective argument based on Taylor's record.<br>?He'll prefer to grind them into the ground,? Greig said rather inelegantly.<br>In the end Taylor declared a little later than Chappell would have liked and a shade earlier than Greig had predicted. So much for experts.<br>No one can deny Chappell's knowledge of the game or that he has a head for tactics.<br>But his job is to inform the viewer about what is happening, not what he thinks should happen, or what he would do or, indeed, what he did. His place in the sun as a ferociously good Australian batsman and captain is assured.<br>His place in the commentary box, however, is marred by too much talk about his days at the helm and his contemporaries.<br>And there have been times in this Test that he has simply refused to give credit where it was due.<br>The worst examples were on Sunday when the English batsmen were flowing and making a great fight of it.<br>It may have been galling from an Australian point of view to see Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain and Graham Thorpe scoring so freely. But their efforts did not deserve the several Chappell cries of ?oh, that's bad batting? when they occasionally slowed down.<br>Chappell aside, viewers would have to be thrilled with this Test. Each day has been full of excellent cricket, with yesterday's century by Michael Slater one of the most entertaining pieces of sporting television this year.<br>It drove Richie Benaud to fits of verbal extravagance ... that is, he said more than five words at once.<br>Benaud, yet another former captain, just gets better. He lets the game do the talking, speaking mostly to inform with simple facts or wry witticisms.<br>Chappell would do well to tone down to the Benaud level.<br>Alternatively he could model himself on Bill Lawry, yes another former captain, who just loves to talk, letting his enthusiasm carry him - and often the viewer - away.<br>Or he could be like Ian Botham - an occasional captain - and speak quietly, earnestly and knowledgeably about the feast of cricket laid out before him. Botham was possibly a bigger larrikin than Chappell in his day, yet appears to have learnt that it is today's players - and not him - in whom we are interested.<br></font></p>
