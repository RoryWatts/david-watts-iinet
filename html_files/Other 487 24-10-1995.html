            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NICHOLAS PIOCH is another Frenchman who has put a bomb under us.<br>Unlike the Pacific ructions of his President Jacques Chirac, Mr Pioch's detonation is for the good of the world.<br>The young Parisian is the curator of the WebMuseum, one of the most educational, attractive and fulfilling sites on the World Wide Web.<br>At weekends and late at night when he is not being a communications and Web consultant, Mr Pioch enriches the lives of browsers by scanning great works of art on to his database. He believes that art is everyone's heritage and its beauty should be free.<br>Rather than see commercial enterprises set up Web sites and charge people, Mr Pioch decided to open the WebMuseum.<br>?Some companies may be trying to get a monopolistic grab on arts and culture, developing a pay-per-view logic, shipping out CD-ROMs while trying to patent stuff which belongs to each of us: a part of our human civilisation and history,? he says in a background analysis of the museum.<br>Visitors can learn about the lives of the great artists and the many schools from gothic to impressionism, through to abstract expressionism and pop art.<br>More importantly, viewers can view works by people as diverse as Botticelli, Raphael, Da Vinci, Monet, Degas, Picasso and David Hockney.<br>If they have viewers or other graphics software they can download artworks in JPG format. And if they can batch convert these JPGs, they can render them as BMPs and create wallpaper that makes zigzag patterns or tartan weaves utterly useless.<br>Mr Pioch claims that 100,000 people visit the museum each week. These visitors download about five million documents.<br>The popularity of the museum can be judged by the fact that the Paris site is mirrored at 24 sites around the world ... the US, Chile, Brazil, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Greece, England, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Turkey and Russia.<br>The University of South Australia mirrors the site here, so image viewing and downloads are relatively fast and painless ... you don't have to watch the paint dry, it already has.<br>Mr Pioch asks for and gets many contributions. There are representations of work from the great galleries like the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay and the Hermitage.<br>He is able to display the art because the Berne Convention on copyright allows the reproduction of works by artists who have been dead 50 years or more.<br>So for the cost of a phone call you can be a virtual Alan Bond and own a virtual Van Gogh.<br>URLs: http://cutl.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/paint/ (great painters index)<br>http://cutl.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/ (WebMuseum home).<br>???<br>AN AUSTRALIAN television comedy of the mid-1980s used to have God returning to Earth ... well Melbourne actually ... and asking the assembled multitude what they would like to know most. He was hoping to reveal the meaning of life.<br>The crowd would yell back at him: ?Give us next week's Lotto numbers.?<br>Well, an Australian site called Beyond the Black Stump offers as one of its more than 100 sites, Next Week's Lotto Numbers.<br>Beyond the Black Stump is at http://www.peg.apc.org/ ~pdg/.<br>You can browse there in your Rolls.<br>???<br>IF YOU fancy you have the skill to be a doctor, you can try a virtual patient interview at the Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, West Virginia.<br>The school's Interactive Patient at http://medicus.marshall.edu/medicus.htm presents a virtual patient complaining of several dodgy symptoms.<br>Your job is to interview and diagnose.<br>Beware, this patient can play dumb. When I asked the standard ?How are your bowels??, the patient claimed not to have understood the question.<br>I never did finish my interview after that. Guess I'll stick with the day job.<br></font></p>
