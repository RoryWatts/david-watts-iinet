            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">In the next life I might use a Mac. Fate intervened back in the 80s and directed me down the PC path. Sad to say, I've barely looked at a Mac; certainly haven't used one in anger.<br>But for the past week, the Web has been nagging me about the wonders of Macintosh ? what you might call Naggintosh.<br>It's been one of those pure surfing experiences, you know, just browsing a few regular sites, then diverging down a few links and suddenly I'm at a page called Mac Ammo with absolutely no idea how I got there. One minute I was looking at pictures of Mars from the CSIRO's Pathfinder mirror, the next I'm being deluged by unequivocal fact after fact about how superior Macs are to their Wintel counterparts. Mac Ammo says many of the same things I've been hearing from devoted Apple users - is there any other kind? - for years. I just haven't been listening.<br>Every PC user knows the kind of flak an Apple person is capable of ? never goes down, hardly have to upgrade, compatible with anything, great graphics, etc ? they do go on.<br>Occasionally, some have even made signs of the cross when I mention the W word, especially followed by 95.<br>I haven't really paid much attention for a variety of reasons: (a) been formatting the hard drive because it keeps crashing; (b) been looking for updated drivers; (c) been trying to keep track of config.sys and autoexec.bat and (d) been trying to restore sys.ini after it was wiped out by an ambitious eight-year-old.<br>Now I don't know. Apple is under pressure businesswise, yet the voices on the Web grow louder in praise. This chorus of approval is hard to ignore. The recent Georgia Institute of Technology Web survey found about 25 per cent of surfers used Macs. We are talking about a significant and apparently satisfied minority here.<br>PC owners like me who've preferred to follow humorist Dave Barry's beliefs that Macs are for drug addicts and arty-farty types, not serious nerds who enjoy challenges, should take a break from win.ini and look at what these addicts are up to.<br>First let's look at a few of those arty-farty types Apple lays claim to as dedicated users:<br>Among actors Apple counts Dan Aykroyd, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks, Dustin Hoffman, Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone and Robin Williams.<br>Authors include Douglas Adams, William Gibson, Mario Puzo and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Singers who allegedly choose Macs include Madonna, all the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson and B.B. King.<br>And in April, Apple named the great Muhammad Ali as one of the latest celebrity users to join its Masters elite.<br>Big names aside, the claims and accolades at Mac Ammo draw most attention. Here are just a very few of them.<br>More than 20 per cent of WWW servers are Macs, second only to Unix;<br>Apple is ranked 114th biggest company by Fortune 500 ahead of McDonald's, Federal Express and Time Warner, and more than 100 places ahead of Microsoft at 219;<br>Macintosh is the No. 1 platform for Web authoring with 41 per cent market share;<br>More than 25 million Macintoshes have been sold and more than 56 million use a Mac each day; And average Netizens have a lot to say at Apple's Why Mac page:<br>"Ninety-eight per cent of all Macintosh-oriented problems get fixed in a week, only 45 per cent of the Windows 95 problems get fixed in a week.?<br>"You can put sideburns and sunglasses on a 50-year-old guy ? but that don't make him Elvis.?<br>"My PC-using friends nearly croak when they see it all working perfectly. And no horror stories. I just plugged everything in.?<br>"While my competitors are batch'n, config'n, figur'n what to do, we're sell'n, close'n, and deposit'n.?<br>The creme de la creme on the Web is the analysis of the test in March last year in which a 10-year-old boy installed a Mac and performed a variety of installations mostly faster than two experienced adults with a PC.<br>Where it leaves the average computer user is anyone's guess as Microsoft revs up for the release of Memphis, or Windows98, in a few months.Such testimonials seem obviously made in good faith and in recognition of a very good product.<br>But are they enough to withstand the Wintel juggernaut in thishyper-marketed age?<br></font></p>
