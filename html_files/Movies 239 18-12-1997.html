            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TITANIC<br>Titanic may be a product of 90s technology - a truly awe-inspiring synthesis of computer animation and live-action footage to recreate the most famous disaster in maritime history - but the plot is pure Edwardian melodrama. Starring Kate Winslet as a poor little rich girl torn between a free-spirited artist travelling in steerage (Leonardo DiCaprio) and her cruel, conniving aristocrat fiance (Billy Zane), this corny upstairs-downstairs yarn with a boatload of stereotypical characters is not worthy of James Cameron's otherwise monumental achievement. When we get to the actual disaster, after an hour and a half of watery love play, Titanic is everything $280 million can buy. From the fateful collision with the iceberg to the eye-popping moment in which the broken beast rises up and slips to its watery grave, writer-director Cameron has rendered the mighty ship's tragic demise so realistically it is as if we had bought tickets not to a movie but to the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. Unfortunately, Cameron is carrying too much dead weight to make this the thrilling epic it might have been, taking three hours to dock when it took the actual Titanic only an hour to go under. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>THE WIGGLES MOVIE<br>Kids as young as two were dancing in the aisles at a recent preview screening of The Wiggles Movie. There's lots of colour, singing and dancing, some magic tricks and a few big, stuffed Muppet characters. The movie plot centres around Wally the Great, a magician with no confidence, who takes off with a Wiggles wand in the hope that it will make him truly great. Dorothy the rose-eating dinosaur gives chase and the Wiggles go in search of her - all of which turns into a big adventure. The sets are brilliantly coloured and sometimes take on the appearance of a Disneyland fairytale. There are big production numbers with dozens of dancing kids and a hilarious surreal sequence which sees The Wiggles jump into a small swimming pool that takes them to the bottom of the ocean to meet their friend the singing Octopus. Naturally, while they're there they perform with the Octopus' underwater band. All of which is very cooool. Well, if you're a toddler . . . maybe. Rated G (Carolyn Martin).<br>A MONGOLIAN TALE<br>It takes a while to settle into the gentle rhythms of A Mongolian Tale, a deceptively simple love story about two childhood sweethearts wrenched apart by cruel fate. But once you're hooked it's hard to let go. Where Western heroes fall in and out of love as often as changing their underpants, in this spare, wrenching drama relationships, once in the blood, are not given up lightly. Screening at the Somerville Auditorium until Sunday. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>ULYSSES' GAZE<br>Theo Angelopoulos' three-hour autobiographical, allegorical meditation on the Bosnian tragedy, the history of cinema, the loss of innocence and cultural unity is a genuine rarity in this era of guns and gags - a full-blown European art movie that we thought had died with the premature passing of Krzysztof Kieslowski. Angelopoulos' only concession to popular taste is that Ulysses' Gaze is largely in English. Harvey Keitel plays a Greek-born film director known only as A (a thinly veiled reference to Angelopoulos himself) who returns home after 35 years for the screening of his latest controversial film. Once there, however, he embarks on an odyssey which takes him from Greece through Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Romania, up the Danube and eventually to war-torn Sarajevo in search of a mythical three rolls of undeveloped film shot in 1905 by a pair of pioneer Balkan film-makers. The missing footage, supposedly the first images of the Balkans, represent for A a lost innocence, a moment before Europe plunged into war and disunity. But this is only the first level of meaning in a film so visually and aurally rich, so aesthetically challeng-ing, that its length and stately pace are absolutely essential for us to absorb the full impact of its ideas. Tough, patience-testing but rewarding. Screening from Monday at the Somerville Auditorium. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>BETTY BLUE<br>Cynics might suggest that an extra hour of Betty Blue simply means 60 minutes more of beautiful, big-mouthed Beatrice Dalle draped across the screen in various states of undress. But there is a point to releasing the director's cut of Jean-Jacques Beineix's 1986 cult hit. In the three-hour version we get several extra characters and scenes (especially fun is Jean-Hugues Anglade's Zorg hilariously robbing a security firm dressed in drag) which help us to understand both Zorg's love for Betty and slow the advance of Betty's mental illness. Those with a little patience will be seduced by the moonstruck lovers - Dalle and Anglade are as sexy as any couple ever to grace the screen - and shaken by Betty's overwhelming passion for both a man and for life itself. At the Luna. Rated R (Mark Naglazas).<br>EXCESS BAGGAGE<br>Taking a leaf out of the Clueless scrapbook, cutey-pie Alicia Silverstone makes her much-talked-about multi-million-dollar producing deal debut with a teen comedy-romance about a brattish rich girl who fakes her own kidnapping. A few funny lines but the scruffy story is laboured and hackneyed. You won't want to go if you're over 20. Rated PG (Ara Jansen).<br>MURDER AT 1600<br>There's big trouble when a corpse turns up at the White House so it's lucky action man Wesley Snipes is there to save the United States . . . and Murder at 1600. Snipes, as Washington homicide detective Harlan Regis, is so vivid that he helps this political thriller, played out against a hostage crisis in North Korea, overcome cliches and storyline flaws. Rated M (David Watts).<br>SPAWN<br>This latest in a long line of cult and super heroes to jump from comic book to big screen differs from other Hollywood blockbusters in its clever use of effects from the Industrial Light and Magic team. So well do reality and Dante-esque fantasy meld in this dark tale about a former government assassin who makes a pact with the devil that it's hard to tell where the live action ends and the computer-generated scenes begin. On the side of hell and evil is the hideous bile-ball Clown (an unrecognisable John Leguizamo), a wisecracker with a fascination for flatulence and cheap puns. It's his constant and often tasteless repartee and unpredictability that give this dark film its much-needed humorous edge. Rated M (Sue Yeap).<br>THE FUNERAL<br>Although The Funeral has been compared with The Godfather movies, Abel Ferrara's dark, dense, low-budget revenge drama is at the opposite end of the crime spectrum to Coppola's great epics. While the Corleones kill then suffer the consequences, these philosophic wise-guys spend as much time worrying about free will and destiny, grace and redemption as fitting their enemies for a pair of cement shoes. Starring Christopher Walken, Chris Penn and Vincent Gallo as the racketeering Tempio brothers in Depression-era New York, The Funeral is one of the most unusual and compelling gangster pictures for some time. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>AIR FORCE ONE<br>With Harrison Ford's famous furrowed brow taking care of characterisation, director Wolfgang Petersen is free to crank up the tension, moving swiftly from the US President's historic no-dealing-with-terrorists speech to the situation of having his family and close aides quivering at the end of a gun in what is supposed to be a flying fortress. It's a pity that Ford didn't make himself more Clintonian - human and vulnerable to attack. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE FULL MONTY<br>There's nothing too flash about this cheeky, one-joke comedy about a group of unemployed steelworkers who, out of desperation, are determined to become Sheffield's answer to the Chippendales. Writer Simon Beaufoy and director Peter Cattaneo attempt to give their story a bit of meat, so to speak, by dealing with the shattered personal and professional lives of the lads but it's not especially convincing. Audiences, however, don't seem to give a fig leaf: all they want to see is a bunch of less-than-average blokes get their clobber off. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br></font></p>
