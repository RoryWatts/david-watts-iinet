            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PEOPLE with life-threatening illnesses are often advised to take life one day at a time. And when the going gets too rough, to take it 10 minutes at a time.<br>People who love sport might be well advised to follow a similar philosophy to prevent the possibility of falling victim to a life-threatening illness caused by the stress and anxiety of worrying whether their team will make the AFL final eight.<br>Obviously, this is directed at Fremantle supporters, who have watched their side degenerate into a bit of an easybeat rabble only two weeks after claiming an important victory against North Melbourne.<br>It is also directed at the weakening hearts of West Coast supporters who have now seen four straight losses by narrow margins.<br>It might be excellent advice. Indeed, all AFL coaches routinely say they are taking things ?one game at a time?. Why not the fans?<br>Unfortunately, the answer is short and easy. It is just one word. If. Sometimes it is preceded by what, as in ?what if?; sometimes it is followed by only, as in ?if only?.<br>Getting away from football for a moment, if might be used the following way:<br>If only Shane Warne didn't have an injured shoulder in India, then Sachin Tendulkar would not have looked the greatest batsman since Don Bradman.<br>Get the hang of it? Try these ?if? statements that football followers around the country, particularly in WA, have been torturing themselves with during the past few days.<br>If Andrew Donnelly had kicked 5cm higher, his point-blank shot against Adelaide on Sunday would have been a goal and not a touched behind, and the Eagles would have entered the last quarter with a bigger chance.<br>If Dean Kemp's over-the-shoulder snap late in the match had gone through, then West Coast would have been only three points down and, the way the team was attacking, would have stolen the game at the end, been 3-4 instead of 2-5, could have afforded to drop five more games and still make the finals, and be a rough chance to rob the bookies of what now looks like a dud bet that the team would be premier.<br>If Fremantle had scored even two goals in the opening quarter against Hawthorn, then it might have given itself heart to fight instead of wandering around in ever-decreasing circles like some lost tribe.<br>If the Dockers are advertising their ball on May 23 as a night to meet the stars, will there be any left by the big night, or will we have to rely on imports?<br>If the Eagles are going the full monty on May 30 will we see anything new? After all, they've been stripped naked and left exposed by what we thought were lesser teams - Richmond in particular - for a couple of weeks now.<br>All this pondering gets no one anywhere, of course.<br>We should relax and take it one game at a time ... if only.<br></font></p>
