            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE State Government's latest venture on the Web caused the scratching of more than a few heads when it was unveiled last week.<br>The Transport Department's acting Director-General Mike Harris admitted he was a little perplexed by the concept of surfers checking out real surf at an artificial reef while surfing on a computer, to decide whether they should go surfing.<br>The slightly surreal scenario will be made possible by his department's new Coastal Data Web site.<br>The site is live, but only in phase one of a three-phase development scheduled to finish in November next year.<br>At the moment, users cannot check the surf at Cottesloe by surfing the Web first. They still have to follow the time-honoured tradition of hanging out in the carpark.<br>But a Coast Cam is expected to be giving real-time images of the conditions at Cottesloe when phase two of the site is finished between next April and June. Other cameras are planned for Trigg, Scarborough and City Beach.<br>The Transport Department's director of coastal facilities management, Kim Stone, said the Web site was just the front end of massive databases that would be built over many years containing valuable information.<br>?The two key things we are trying to achieve is make sure we have all the data sets under control. The Coastal Data centre brings all the information sets together and makes it readily available to the user,? Mr Stone said.<br>Robert Kay, who managed the project, had not only ensured the data was safely stored but had made it accessible to the public, he said.<br>The site allows surfers - the Web kind - just one live camera view at the moment, from an Axis 200+ digital CCD camera using 24-bits colour representation.<br>It is in Essex Street, Fremantle, and looks out over Fremantle waters to Garden Island. Images are refreshed every few minutes and an archive of images over the previous 18 hours is available.<br>Local councils and businesses were being tempted at the site's unveiling into thinking about sponsoring some of Coastal Data's yet-to-be finalised fine points, like the Coast Cams.<br>The site is designed as an online mecca for WA's big population of water users - not only surfers, but fishermen, sailors and swimmers.<br>It provides tide and wave information in well designed and easy-to-follow graphical form - developed by the Egg design group. It can show where to buy marine charts for the entire State, in fact any presently publicly available information that affects the water.<br>Developers, environmental groups and historians are now able to access online a database of coastal and marine charts, plans and drawings dating back to the late 1800s.<br>Up-to-date safety notices, known as notices to mariners, that accompany nautical charts are also online at the site.<br>The aim is to provide the information faster and in easily digestible form.<br>The site is at: www.coastaldata.trans port.wa.gov.au.<br></font></p>
