            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH online company AdultShop.com has a simple plan - it would like to dominate the world.<br>Its plan revolves around sex, easily the biggest money-spinner on the Internet.<br>Malcolm Day, the managing director of Western Minerals which will change its name to AdultShop.com in a few weeks, sees rich potential in selling adult goods such as videos, books and sex toys from its Web site.<br>AdultShop.com's site is not expected to be launched officially until December.<br>But in the month since it first appeared on the Web - with one steamy picture and an invitation to register interest - thousands have entered their e-mail addresses so they can keep abreast of AdultShop's growth.<br>Mr Day told The West Australian in an e-mail interview the aim was to dominate the online sex shop market.<br>The Eros Foundation has estimated that Australians spend $180 million a year on adult products, $50 million of that through mail order.<br>The global online adult entertainment industry is estimated at $10 billion a year. Mr Day says AdultShop only faces competition from a few small online shops.<br>?These are small non-professional sites which offer a limited product range,? he said. ?There are no Aussie sites with any market dominance. Similarly, there are no such sites with any world dominance. That's our optimistic plan - to have world dominance.?<br>The strategy is simple: target a huge but highly fragmented global market; establish a global brand through the Internet, and sit back while the money pours in.<br>AdultShop expects a lot of its trade will come from people who might be too embarrassed to walk into a sex shop in the so-called real world, and are more comfortable ordering over the Web.<br>Mr Day said AdultShop would try to form alliances with other adult products companies worldwide so overseas orders could be filled easily.<br>AdultShop will also have the resources of 21 Barbarellas stores behind it. Mr Day is a director of Barbarellas and AdultShop is basically the child of that well-known WA sex shop.<br>Mr Day, a 34-year-old civil engineer, drifted into the sex shop business after a three-month holiday in the US in 1994.<br>He returned to Australia with the idea of introducing such businesses as phone sex and dating services here. He built a computerised messaging service, where lonely people could leave a brief message about themselves along with a phone number.<br>He then approached Barbarellas and the two entered into a joint venture and began developing an e-commerce site - AdultShop.com.<br>AdultShop's stock has been trading on the stock exchange for a month. It found its way to the market through a takeover of gold miner Western Minerals, which suspended trading in late March at 5.8¢ a share. When WestMin - Mr Day's shelf company for AdultShop - resumed trading in June, the shares jumped to about 25¢. They are now in the high 30s.<br>One possible snag facing AdultShop is the Government's Net censorship laws which will come into force on January 1.<br>The laws will allow the Australian Broadcasting Authority to rate sites. An X-rating will mean the site cannot be accessed by Australians, and R-rated sites will be accessible only through age-verification programs.<br>Mr Day said he did not expect AdultShop to be rated X, but there were plans for an R-rated, adults-only section of the site that would sell magazines and videos.<br></font></p>
