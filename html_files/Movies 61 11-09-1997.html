            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">New releases<br>KISS OR KILL<br>The title comes from a poem by Dylan Thomas but there's nothing literary or lyrical about this raw, edgy Australian-made road movie with star-making performances from Love and Other Catastrophes alumni Matt Day and Frances O'Connor. Seeking to rev up his career after the disappointments of the Two If By Sea, Bill Bennett has thrown off the trappings (script, music soundtrack, tripod, continuity editing), giving this story about a pair of sexy con artists on the run from the law and a psychopathic former footy star an energy and pace rare in local movies. There are some very interesting ideas about truth, lies and pretence in Kiss or Kill, dubbed Nullabor Noir by one critic. Unfortunately, the plot overheats well before reaching its destination, stranding its talented leads in the middle of nowhere. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>THE LEOPARD<br>Luchino Visconti's lush, richly detailed adaptation of Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel about the dying days of the Sicilian aristocracy serves to remind us what art movies used to be like. Long (at just over three hours), thick with ideas and paced so slowly you're forced to study every look, gesture and word, The Leopard (with Burt Lancaster in the title role) is the perfect antidote to the mindless, MTV-inspired cinema of today. See Arts Today, page 5, for the full story.At the Astor. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas).<br>MABO<br>Mabo - Life of an Island Man is a documentary about Eddie Koiki Mabo, the Torres Strait Islander whose claim of ownership of his ancestral land became the test case in the Aboriginal land rights struggle. According to The West's Aboriginal affairs reporter, Leeroy Betti, it is the most relevant film screening in Australia. For Betti's interview with director Trevor Graham see Arts Today, page 6. Rated PG<br>MEN IN BLACK<br>At last a movie that justifies all the hype. Making madcap mockery of the tabloid-fuelled obsession with things not of this planet, Men In Black imagines a world crawling with aliens - not the big-headed, post-Roswell kind but normal-looking folk who behave themselves and live in New York where they won't be conspicuous. To keep them in line there's a team of agents, the men in black, who maintain their anonymity with a special memory-erasing weapon. The unsung heroes in what becomes a battle to save the world from destruction are played by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, a pair of laid-back hipsters (think of Ghostbusters by way of Reservoir Dogs) who still manage a wisecrack even when up to their necks in alien goo. The jokes are wonderful, the special effects sensational but the most amusing notion is that tabloid newspapers are our only reliable source of information. ?Best investigative reporting on the planet,? remarks Jones' veteran alien-buster. ?You can read the New York Times. They get lucky sometimes.? Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>Recent releases<br>Albino Alligator<br>Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects) makes a solid directing debut with this twisty hostage drama about three low-rent crims - played by Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise and William Fichtner - who inadvertently find themselves at the centre of a siege. Some will find it all a little too theatrical, with its one-set locale and plenty of speeches. But fully rounded adult drama with genuine ethical questions is so rare these days that Spacey's move behind the camera is to be welcomed. At the Luna. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>ADDICTED TO LOVE<br>If Tom Hanks saw leather-clad, mouthy Meg Ryan in this twisted tale of two forlorn dumpees who take revenge on their respective dumpers - "The only way that girl is coming back to you is if a blast of semen catapults her across the street,? she snarls - he'd not just be sleepless in Seattle but bolting all the doors. It's an unholy marriage of romance and black comedy but first-<br>time director Griffin Dunne manages to strike the right balance. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas).<br>ABSOLUTE POWER<br>Clint Eastwood tries to bring a Hitchcockian lightness of touch to this thriller about a cat-burglar who stumbles on a murder and a trail of blood that leads to high places. The problem is that the film lurches between being a dark, disturbingly relevant drama about sexual deviance and corruption in high places and a Mission Impossible knock-off with Clint as the man of a thousand funny wigs. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>AUSTIN POWERS<br>Mike Myers (of Wayne's World fame) had the good sense to yank Austin Powers, a cross between a Carnaby Street swinger and a Bond-like super-spy, out of the 1960s and into the politically correct 90s. While his mouthful of crooked teeth (legacy of bad British dental care), purple crushed-velvet suit and foppish ruffled cravat are amusing, it's his outmoded self-deluding macho attitudes - "How "bout a shag, baby? is his best come-on line - that get the biggest laughs. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>BRASSED OFF<br>There's much to like in this stirring British comedy-drama about a mine closure that threatens the future of a long-standing colliery brass band, especially the heartfelt performance of Pete Postlethwaite as the band's leader, Danny. But writer-director Mark Herman avoids the really interesting questions, such as the logic of supporting a filthy business that's sending Danny to an early grave, choosing instead to wallow in working-class sentiment. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>CAREER GIRLS<br>Some will find this awkward, ever-so-slight tale about two former uni flat-mates who get together for a nostalgic weekend a bit of a disappointment after the giddy highs of Mike Leigh's previous outing, Secrets and Lies. Still, Katrin Cartlidge and newcomer Lynn Steadman give compelling performances and there's a couple of wonderfully scurrilous anti-yuppie jokes. At the Luna. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>CONSPIRACY THEORY<br>Mel Gibson has played delusional paranoics before (Hamlet, Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs) but he's never had as much fun as he does with Jerry Fletcher, a taxi driver who believes in just about every fruitcake conspiracy theory ever hatched. The problem is that Gibson's goofing around injects unnecessary levity into what is supposed to be a serious-minded thriller, leaving love interest Julia Roberts just as baffled as the rest of the audience. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS<br>Ostensibly about the struggles of a transsexual looking for acceptance, Different For Girls thankfully avoids cliches and titillation in favour of a more intellectual and emotional approach to the gender, personality and identity issues that arise after a sex change. It's helped by very engaging performances from Rupert Graves (of Room With A View fame) and Steven Mackintosh (last seen, ironically, in the Shakespearean gender-bender Twelfth Night) as a pair of old friends who strike up the kind of relationship that has been the butt of jokes in the school shower block. At the Luna. Rated MA (Sue Yeap).<br>FACE/OFF<br>After the relative disappointments of Hard Target and Broken, John Woo has finally pulled off an American picture which captures the hyperbolic high style and bloody poetry of his best Hong Kong work. Woo also pushes his signature theme - that all men have the capacity for good and evil in them - into dizzying new territory by having the antagonists (played with relish by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta) swap faces. The result is, quite simply, the most outrageously entertaining movie of the year. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>FEVER PITCH<br>Based on Nick Hornsby's autobiographical best-seller about a mad-keen Arsenal supporter who is forced to choose between his team and his woman, Fever Pitch is as much about finding a family, responsibility and hanging on to your childhood dreams. Even non-soccer fans should find something to laugh at in this understated and charming romantic comedy. Rated M (Sue Yeap).<br>FOR ROSEANNA<br>Thankfully the Americans only supplied the money (and the sexy Mercedes Ruehl) for this solidly European production about a restaurateur (Jean Reno) who works overtime to keep his fellow citizens of a small Italian town safe so his dying wife can have a plot next to their daughter. What might have been overblown and over-sentimental in the hands of a Hollywood schlock-meister is treated with taste and restraint by Brit Paul Weiland, who gives the movie a lovely bitter-sweet quality. Rated M (David Watts).<br>GABBEH<br>Originally intended as a documentary about nomads who weave colourful, exquisitely crafted rugs known as gabbehs, director Mohsen Makhmalbaf instead has gone deeper, weaving a dreamlike tale which beautifully captures the inner lives of this these tradition-bound people. Using a deceptively simple style yet filling almost every frame with breathtakingly bright colours - each highly symbolic colour, we gradually learn, is woven into the very fabric of their lives - Makhmalbaf brings a humanity and understanding to people who are normally sociological curiosities. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated G (Mark Naglazas).<br>OUT TO SEA<br>In this classic shipboard farce, Jack Lemmon plays a grieving recent widower whose con-artist brother-in-law Charlie (Walter Matthau) manoeuvres him on to a Caribbean cruise by pretending that he's won a free trip. Herb is appalled to discover that he must work as a ?taxi dancer? or be forced to cough up for the expensive trip. Robert Nelson Jacobs' script is a wonder, giving full play to Lemmon and Matthau's formidable comic gifts that are deftly played against genuine sentiment. Rated PG (Jack Matthews - LA Times).<br>SLING BLADE<br>Billy Bob Thornton gives an astonishing performance as Karl Childers, a monosyllabic naif who has spent 25 years in a mental institution after murdering his mother and her lover. While this low-key Oscar winner is to be applauded for its restrained approach to a subject that might have collapsed under the weight of melodrama and sentiment, it's a pity that it doesn't push a little harder in exploring its theme of innocence defiled and purifying retribution. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>SMILLA'S FEELING FOR SNOW<br>Unsmiling Miss Smilla may have a special feeling for snow, but Bille August, who has adapted Pete Hoeg's literary phenomenon, has not a skerrick for the basic conventions of the thriller. He does wonders evoking the chilly atmospherics of Hoeg's story about a part-Inuit woman named Smilla Jasperson (Julia Ormond) whose investigation of the death of a young boy takes her from mid-winter Copenhagen to Greenland's frozen coast. However, when it comes to building tension and orchestrating an action sequence, August (a Dane best known for art movies such as Pelle the Conqueror and The Best Intentions) has all the panache of a flamenco dancer in a pair of snow shoes. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY<br>If Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino agreed to collaborate, this bleakly comic crime thriller with a big ensemble cast and loosely connected narrative threads might have been the result. Not all the pieces of this elaborate jigsaw puzzle of a movie quite fit but it's never boring. At the Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br></font></p>
