            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">January 6 already. The Christmas tree should be down and the New Year's Eve hangover should be gone. Time now to think what this year on-line will bring.<br>I am not brave enough to make forecasts about the Net. The cyber world still grows at a feverish rate, and the world of hardware, in particular, is like an avalanche. That enhanced 386 with 4Mb of RAM bought in 1993 for $3500 now looks silly compared with the $2000 Pentium 200 with 32Mb of RAM available in the shops now.<br>It all changes so fast that I am still amazed by the prediction made in October 1996 by computing commentators at cnet that the Web browser was boring and other software would come to dominate the Net world in 1997.<br>This rash prediction was reinforced early last year by the similarly hip and Net-aware team at Hotwired. They said 1997 would see browsers move aside in favour of Java and other dynamic technology.<br>Retrospective wisdom is a wonderful thing. They were both horribly wrong. If anything, 1997 ended up being the Year of the Browser and Very Little Else.<br>This is almost entirely due to the US Department of Justice seeking to stop Microsoft forcing computer retailers to bundle Internet Explorer with Windows95 or to make them include any future MS browser with future operating systems.<br>The allegation is that this is a massive restraint of trade, giving MS, with 80 per cent of the world operating system market, an unfair advantage over other browser makers. And there is only one of course: Netscape, which last week still enjoyed top spot in the market, but whose share has been wilting under the MS onslaught.<br>Microsoft has so far thrown a lot of its considerable resources into fighting the Justice Department. The Seattle software giant of Bill Gates has to. Its development of Internet Explorer 4.0 last year and the emerging Windows98 both join the PC and the Web in a harmonious partnership.<br>Microsoft is trying to buck court rulings now that have ordered it to separate Win95 from the Explorer browser. By being pedantic, MS has alleged Win95 cannot work without the Explorer browser. People who bought Win95 early on and eschewed the old Explorer 2.0 for Netscape know this to be a nonsense.<br>A report in Wired News on December 18 suggested MS's claim that Win95 could not work without Explorer, was ?stretching the truth and capitalising on public ignorance?. It quoted a Malcolm Duncan of Purdue University as saying Microsoft was like a 19th century snake oil salesmen.<br>If you look back 12 months many Net users were just coming to grips with the version 3.0 of both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, both released in September 1996.<br>Netscape struck first last year with beta releases of Communicator, not only a version 4.0 browser, but a comprehensive suite of Net tools as well.<br>Within months MS left jaws gaping with betas of its Explorer 4.0. It took over PC operating systems, applying a seamless integration of the PC and the Web.<br>The result by last week was this, according to Browserwatch: Netscape had 57.7 per cent of the market and MSIE 31.6. A hotch-potch of other browsers like Mosaic and Opera accounted for the rest. Netscape had about 70 per cent at the beginning of the year.<br>But the following interesting facts about browser use emerged recently in one of the biggest surveys done on the Web by Georgia Tech's Graphic, Visualisation and Usability Centre:<br>a) the dominant method people acquire browsers is via bundling with hardware, software, and Internet service providers;<br>b) the majority of users never switch browsers (even among users who have been on the Internet for over three years).<br>GVU summarised: ?Given these new findings, it is not surprising to see the slow, but steady emergence of Internet Explorer as market share is being gained primarily from new users who receive the browser bundled as part of other computer-related purchases.?<br>On the other hand, however ? MS has a good product that, in betas of Windows98 at least, draws the PC and the Web together successfully and seductively.<br>I'm brave enough to make this prediction: 1998 will be the year of the browser ? again.<br>HELP DESK<br>cnet:<br>www.cnet.com<br>Hotwired:<br>www.hotwired.com<br>Wired report:<br>www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/<br>9267.html<br>Browserwatch:<br>browserwatch.internet.com/stats/stats.html<br>GVU survey:<br>www.gvu.gatech.edu/user-surveys/survey-1997-10/<br></font></p>
