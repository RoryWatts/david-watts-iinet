            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IRISHMEN who are nostalgic and melancholy (aka drunk) have been known to burst forth with a few verses of Danny Boy. Some Scots will give I Belong to Glasgow a skirl; Yorkshiremen will give the wonderfully daft sounding On Ilkley Moor Baht 'at a reet going over.<br>Italians love nothing more than a full-throated and dramatic O Sole Mio, while I swear more than a few French are prone to La Marseillaise when they are nearly prone.<br>But what do we sing in Australia? Older generations seem to prefer a galloping rendition of The Road to Gundagai when still in that euphoric state preceding melancholy. When the sad memories grip, they can mournfully reel off The Dying Stockman or Our Andy's Gone With Cattle Now (Our Hearts are out of order).<br>The 35-50 age group is a different matter altogether, however. This maligned generation called Baby Boomers was raised on TV and can often be counted on to fill a pub with old commercials as the night revs up.<br>I once saw this phenomenon first-hand on a New Year's Eve about 15 years ago at an old pub in The Rocks down by Sydney Harbour.<br>The public bar was packed with people in their late 20s and 30s and there was a piano in the middle of the floor at which sat a madman who could play any request.<br>As the night went on we bellowed Louie Da Fly, I Like Aeroplane Jelly and We're Happy Little Vegemites.<br>But as the evening mellowed, out came the serious stuff: ?Green Acres is the place to be; Farm living is the life for me; Land spreading out so far and wide; Keep Manhattan just give me that countryside.?<br>That was the theme to the 60s TV comedy Greenacres for those too young to remember.<br>It was followed quickly by this gem: ?They're creepy and they're kooky; Mysterious and spooky; They're oft together hooky; The Addams Family.? Thereafter came F Troop (The end of the Civil War was near); Gilligan's Island (Five passengers set sail that day for a three-hour tour ... a three-hour tour) and The Beverly Hillbillies (Let me tell ya bout a man named Jed, poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed.)<br>Oh, it was sad. The night ended with the king of them all. The bar patrons mumbled lowly the magic words ?Rollin, rollin, rollin?, and suddenly it was on: ?Keep movin, movin, movin; Though they're disapprovin'; Keep them dogies movin; Rawhide?.<br>The big one. The night ended with a bang; and Rawhide was not even the best western of its day (1959-66), despite giving Clint Eastwood his big start as Rowdy Yates.<br>The better one was Have Gun Will Travel, which had a different song at the start and end of each episode it was so good. I can't remember the order but one went ?Have Gun Will Travel is the card of a man?. The other was ?Palladin, Palladin, where do you ride; What will your mission be?.<br>What I lament now, being an old fuddy-duddy, is the lack of TV themes to sing.<br>Neighbours and Home and Away have fairly syrupy little songs and most of the big, adult shows now announce themselves only with instrumentals (although there was never anything wrong with the themes to Hawaii Five-O, Mission Impossible and The Avengers, for example. They are just a bit hard to render by mouth percussion when drunk).<br>A show like Melrose Place could take a leaf out of the baby-boom hits and have a really catchy theme (Aaron Spelling please take note and send money).<br>For example: ?They're sexy and they're slinky; All devious and bitchy; They make me go all twitchy; The girls of Melrose Place.?<br></font></p>
