            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">QUINLUNDERS will be pecking their ports to go on holidays, hoping to jump in a pearl with their togs and remembering to remove their senshews.<br>If that's all Greek to you you're in the wrong continent. Try closer to home, Queensland (Quinlund) to be exact. The opening sentence is a rough approximation of how they speak.<br>Translated, it means: Queenslanders will be packing their bags to go on holidays, hoping to jump in a pool with their bathers and remembering to remove their joggers.<br>Funny people aren't they? After all the Sunshine State gave us Flo and Joh Bjelke-Petersen so it's not unreasonable to expect a few language difficulties. No one could understand what those two were on about a lot of the time.<br>Actually I'm a Quinlunder, but stints in Melbourne, Sydney, London and Perth have played havoc with my accent (or ecksant).<br>I was once showing some Queensland mates around Melbourne and we stopped to buy some stamps. It took about two minutes for one relaxed friend to tell the woman behind the counter he'd like some stamps. ?Uuuh I.I aah ummm widd laik some ummm umm stemps perleeeeze.? (that's how it came out).<br>The post office woman blurted out in precise Melburnian: ?Icarnunnerstenaword-yasayinmate.?<br>Had to translate, so we could get out of there in under half an hour.<br>And when I first came to Perth - from Sydney - I went to a Mosman Park estate agent to ask about flats to rent. The conversation went this way.<br>Me: ?Gday?.<br>Real estate woman: ?Aww hellair thar. Kin I hep you.?<br>Me: ?I'mlookinforaouse.?<br>Real estate woman: ?Now slow down love. You're from Sydney aren't you. This is Perth, we do things more slowly here.?<br>We have a wonderfully relaxed style of English which the scholars call Strine. A magistrate acquaintance loves it so much he is thinking of mounting a vigorous campaign for the revival of the words cobber and bonzer.<br>They are hard words to find in speech these days. Often cobber is replaced by mate - fair enough - but more and more it is usurped by buddie.<br>Yuck, just too American. The Coca-colonisation of language has also virtually wiped out bonzer, substituting cool and wicked in its place.<br>The far more Aussie words beaut and bewdy don't seem to be holding up among the young, particularly.<br>But there are places where Strine still peeks through. One is a bulletin for foreign tourists holidaying on the Gold Coast, which as we know is in Quinlund.<br>Some bits of helpful advice from that bulletin:<br>Arvo - afternoon.<br>Bunyip - legendary monster believed to live in billabongs (waterholes). Dag - someone who is out of fashion.<br>Esky - insulated box for keeping drinks and food cold (cooler).<br>Have a Rage - have a great time, party hard.<br>No worries - not a problem, everything will be OK.<br>Pressie - present or gift.<br>Thongs - Rubber sandals (flip flops/jandals) very popular with Aussies, especially in Queensland (where I suspect the State anthem is Just a Thong at Twilight).<br>???<br>AS THIS column is about nothing most of the time, I was relieved to read in the Sydney Morning Herald that the UN had declared 1997 to be the Year of Nothing.<br>Actually that's not quite right. It said it had not declared 1997 to be the year of anything.<br>This year has been International Year for the Eradication of Poverty (but we all knew that didn't we?). Last year was the Year for Tolerance. 1998 will be the International Year of the Ocean and 1999 the Year of the Elderly.<br></font></p>
