            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DISAPPOINTED West Coast supporters can shake off reality for a few days with a nifty Internet calculator available on the World Wide Web.<br>There they will find the AFL Final 8 Calculator site which shows it is possible to conjure up a West Coast v Adelaide grand final on September 26.<br>This nightmare scenario for Victorians is highly unlikely in real life, but theoretically possible. The starting point is for both to win this weekend, of course.<br>The calculator takes the pain out of trying to work out the McIntyre final eight permutations with a fixture card and a pencil.<br>It is a must-have tool for the diehard Internet football fan once the finals get under way, and fun for the dreamers until then. Another must-have is the All-Time AFL Ladder, which covers all teams from 1897 to the latest round, and shows their position.<br>The top four since 1897 are: Collingwood with a win/loss ratio of 62.46, followed by Carlton (62.16), West Coast (61.62) and Essendon (58.12).<br>The wooden spooner is the long-defunct University team with a ratio of 22.22. Brisbane is bottom of present clubs with 33.08.<br>Breakdowns of the ladder into 10-year segments are also available.<br>Web addresses:<br>AFL Final 8 Calculator<br>www.cyntax.com.au/final8/finals.htm<br>All-Time League Ladder<br>www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Stage/ 3359/aflatll/.<br></font></p>
