            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BACK amid the mists of time, my Year 9 English teacher devised a test designed to sort the wheat from the chaff. She asked each member of the class to try to describe a corkscrew without using their hands. (Maybe it was a spiral staircase . . . it was more than 30 years ago.)<br>Those who passed the test went on to become giants in the world - English teachers and journalists.<br>Those who failed can be found in the lower rungs of society - architects, nuclear physicists, research scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, chief executives, that sort of thing.<br>Society likes to put people in compartments. Doctors and lawyers are often regarded as the brightest and best minds in the land, well above plumbers, TV technicians and yes, journalists, for example.<br>After years of school and maybe tertiary education, it is possible to believe that the ultimate is to become a doctor, lawyer or scientist. If you do not, you are not up with the big boys and girls.<br>But after a few more decades on the planet, you begin to see this is not necessarily so. Anyone who has heard football coaches Mick Malthouse and Kevin Sheedy speak at a function knows they would do well at whatever they chose. And neither was a rocket scientist at school.<br>And take the case of Kerry Stokes. The story of the TV repairman who played his hunches so well he became a media magnate gives hope to every Wayne, Shirley, Sky and Josh out there struggling with Pythagoras' theorem.<br>Yet the people who run our country, indeed several countries, belong to the traditionally-accepted bright set.<br>They are mostly lawyers.<br>Our Federal coalition front bench is crawling with them. Prime Minister John Howard was a solicitor, Treasurer Peter Costello a barrister, Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith lists his previous life as a solicitor, and Communications Minister Richard Alston was a barrister.<br>You can throw in Senator Robert Hill (Environment), Senator Amanda Vanstone (Justice), Daryl Williams (Attorney-General), Phillip Ruddock (Immigration), Senator Nick Minchin (Industry), Senator Jocelyn Newman (Social Security), Bronwyn Bishop (Aged Care), Peter McGauran (Arts) and John Anderson (Transport).<br>Over on the Labor side, the MPs are more likely to have been teachers or union officials but Gareth Evans, Senator Nick Bolkus and member for Perth Stephen Smith have all been legal eagles.<br>It is fairly well known that Hillary Clinton, long-suffering First Lady of the US, was a lawyer. Husband Bill finished law school, lectured in law, then entered politics all within the space of a couple of years in the early 70s.<br>British Prime Minister Tony Blair did much the same, and his wife, Cherie Booth, is a Queen's Counsel.<br>So lawyers are not only perceived to be smart, they are powerful as well. Yet we know that more than a few of those named above have been as sharp as a bowling ball at times.<br>To further emphasise that lawyer does not necessarily equal smart, I pass on these samples of their work, sent to me by an e-mail correspondent. They are said to be actual questions asked in court:Now doctor, isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, he doesn't know about it until the next morning?The youngest son, the 20-year-old, how old is he?Q. So the date of conception (of your baby ) was August 8? A. Yes Q. And what were you doing at that time? Was it you or your younger brother who was killed in the war?Q. She had three children, right? A. Yes Q. How many were boys? A. None Q. Were there any girls?Q. You said the stairs went down to the basement? A. Yes Q. And these stairs, did they go up also?Were you present when your picture was taken?How many times have you committed suicide?How far apart were the vehicles at the time of the collision?<br>The prosecution rests.<br></font></p>
