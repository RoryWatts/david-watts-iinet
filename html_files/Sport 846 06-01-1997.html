            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TRIATHLON looks more like torture than sport. The combination of swimming, cycling and running is for the superfit and will make its Olympic debut at Sydney in 2000.<br>This is a stellar rise for a sport that started official competitions only in 1978 when the Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon was held.<br>Minor events had been held in California as early as 1973, but the Hawaiian tournament is recognised as the one that made the sport international.<br>Triathlons began in Australia in 1981-82, and our beaches, open air and the ironman tradition from surf lifesaving ensured its popularity as well as international success for Australia.<br>The first State triathlon associations were formed in late 1984 and early 1985. In May 1986 at Broadbeach, Queensland, the Triathlon Federation of Australia was formed.<br>In 1991, the name of the national governing body was changed to Triathlon Australia. Triathlon Australia boasts a membership of 10,000 with more than 100 clubs affiliated.<br>The international governing body is the International Triathlon Union (ITU), which was formed in Avignon, France in April 1989. Membership has grown to 105 national governing bodies, an indication of the strength of the sport worldwide.<br>The first officially sanctioned World Championship was held in Avignon in August 1989. Subsequent championships have been held on the Gold Coast, in the US, New Zealand, Canada and Britain.<br>World championships are held over what has become the official triathlon distances - 1.5km swim, 40km bike ride and 10km run. The Olympics will be over these distances.<br>However, other triathlon events can be held over a variety of courses. The sprint is 750m swim, 20km bike and 5km run; the long is 2km swim, 80km bike and 20km run, and the ultra (sometimes known as the ironman) is 3.8km swim, 180km bike and 42.2km (marathon) run.<br>A breakaway group, the Triathlon Grand Prix has taken the sport into the big prizemoney arena and attracted global television coverage for its $100,000 events.<br>Australian Greg Welch has become a well known international star with his grand prix appearances.<br>TRIATHLETES can start the sport as young as seven. The junior youth category covers children aged 7-10. They compete in a 100m swim, 5km bike ride and 1km run.<br>The senior youth (11-14) age group swim 200m, ride 12km and run 3km.<br>Short-course triathlons cover a 300m-1km swim, an 8-25km bike ride and 1.5-5km run.<br>Equipment<br>Swim: Swimsuit, goggles, towels (to sit on in transition area, dry off, wipe feet), bucket (with water to wash sand off feet), wetsuit (as well as warding off cold helps keep the body in the best swimming position), swim cap, sunscreen, petroleum jelly (to ease rashes on crotch, nipples and underarms).<br>Bike: helmet, bike shoes, socks, bike shorts, jersey/singlet, gloves (probably not in a short race), cycling glasses, water bottles, spare tyres/tubes, CO2 cartridges, tool kit, floor pump, frame pump, bike lube.<br>Run: running shoes, socks, shorts, hat/visor, sunglasses.<br>Miscellaneous: watch, race number, course information, first aid kit, energy food, drink, some warm clothes.<br>?If God invented marathons to keep people from doing anything more stupid, triathlon must have taken Him completely by surprise.? P.Z. Pearce, M.D.<br>Wetsuits<br>Wetsuits make open water swims safer by providing the wearer with added warmth and flotation. They also provide a speed advantage. It comes from the added flotation that puts a swimmer's body in a higher and more ?correct? position. This is the position that a good swimmer achieves with proper technique. Therefore, wetsuits speed-up a poor swimmer with poor body position much more than they speed-up a swimmer who uses good body position already.<br>Recommended reading<br>Ageless Athlete by Richard Winett; The Complete Triathlon Training Manual by Bob Johnson and Patricia Braggs<br>World rankings<br>MEN: 1 Miles Stewart (Australia)<br>2 Alexander Manzan (Bra)<br>3 Leandro Mavedo (Bra)<br>4 Dimitry Gaag (Rus)<br>5 Philippe Fattori (Fra)<br>6 Greg Bennett (US)<br>7 Simon Lessing (UK)<br>8 Ralf Eggert (Ger)<br>9 Chris McCormack (Australia)<br>10 Paul Amey (NZ)<br>WOMEN: 1 Emma Carey (Australia)<br>2 Carol Montgomery (Can)<br>3 Jackie Gallagher (Australia)<br>4 Nicole Andronicus (Australia)<br>5 Rina Hill (Australia)<br>6 Gail Laurence (US)<br>7 Sarah Harrow (NZ)<br>8 Sabine Graf-Westhoff (Ger)<br>9 Jenny Rose (NZ)<br>10 Sharon Donnelly (Can)<br>NEXT WEEK: Lawn Bowls<br>Ironman Greg Welch<br>GREG WELCH is probably Australia's best known ironman triathlete, thanks to the high exposure television gives the sport.<br>Nicknamed ?Plucky? because of his fighting spirit, he is 32 (December 13 birth date), lives in Cronulla, Sydney and trains in San Diego, California, and Boulder, Colorado.<br>Career Highlights: Ironman Triathlon World Championship 2nd 1991; 6th 1992; 1st 1994; 4th 1995. Welch has won more than 30 triathlon titles, including the ITU World Championship.<br>One of triathlon's most colourful characters, Welch is only 170cm and 61kg. Welch first gained attention during his second ironman attempt in 1989. Still a construction worker in Australia at the time, Welch finished third behind US triathlon superstars Mark Allen and Dave Scott.<br>Immediately respected for his blistering running speed and overall balance, Welch has gained a reputation as one of the few triathletes who can win at any distance.<br>He also is one of only five men to run under 2 hours and 50 minutes during the marathon on the treacherous, Kona, Hawaii, ironman course. He's one of the fastest runners on the Triathlon Grand Prix circuit with a personal best time of 29min.41sec. for 10km.<br>Training: Typical schedule, swim 5 hours per week, bike 14 hours per week and run 5 hours per week.<br>Our number ones<br>AUSTRALIAN triathletes are ranked both number one man and woman by the International Triathlon Union.<br>The number one woman is EMMA CARNEY whose best results include the 1994 ITU World Championship in Wellington, New Zealand.<br>She won that title as a virtual unknown having only just turned pro. At 25 she has a bright future with Olympic gold beckoning.<br>Carney has tremendous running background.<br>The number one man is Miles Stewart, who was basically unknown in 1989 when he proceeded to knock off a top field at USTS Vermont in his second race there.<br>Stewart is colourful on and off the race course. His racing and demeanor displays confidence and self-assuredness beyond his years. His career has not been without controversy, however.<br>He was axed from the Australian national team for the 1990 World Championships for violating team policy.<br>At 18 Stewart signed a six-figure sponsorship deal, which although short-lived, made him the highest paid triathlete of the time.<br>His athletic background is wide-ranging. He competed at national junior level in swimming, cycling, running, and speed roller-skating. His father Col coaches him.<br>HITS: Sources of information and statistics<br>http://www.triathlon.org/rankings/index.html (ITU Rankings)<br>http://www.triathlon.org/results/96/index.html (1996 ITU World Cup Results)<br>http://www.ausport.gov.au/trisp.html (Triathlon - Australian Sports Commission site)<br>http://www.triathlon.org/Media-Guide/index.html (ITU World Cup Media Guide)<br></font></p>
