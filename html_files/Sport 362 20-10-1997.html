            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EVEN on the third or fourth viewing, it was almost impossible to believe that a horse could level a field like Might and Power did in Saturday's Caulfield Cup.<br>The gelding led all the way and accelerated to an eight-length victory in the record time of 2min. 26.2sec. in front of the biggest cup crowd in 16 years.<br>It was breathless stuff, inviting comparisons with the mighty Tulloch's 1957 win. In fact trainer Lee Freedman said it was better and chief steward Des Gleeson said the victory was a highlight of the turf in his time. The Sunday Herald-Sun in Melbourne said the Sydney outsider had bewildered the entire racing community with his staggering run.<br>As a golden moment for armchair viewers it ranks right up there with some of this year's more memorable sporting highlights, good and bad.<br>It will be as required a highlight in end-of-the-year recaps as Glenn McGrath's eight wickets at Lord's, Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield and Pat Rafter leaping into the crowd after winning the US Open.<br>Channel 9 replayed the cup in full without fanfare or comment at the start of the Racing Show during the lunch break in yesterday's South Australia-Tasmania one-day cricket.<br>It was the right way to present it, too. Such a stunning sporting moment required no fireworks. It spoke for itself.<br>And still the disbelieving punter would have wondered when Might and Power would drop back through the field. He had done enough, set the pace, time to let the real fancies like Marble Halls or even Iron Horse take over the running.<br>But it wasn't to be ... and it never will.<br>The demolition was so unbelievable that even yesterday the Racing Show's three wise men - Johnny Tapp, Simon O'Donnell and Shane Dye - still looked shell-shocked.<br>O'Donnell forgot he was on the Racing Show and started talking like he was a true-blue-and-white Victorian panellist on the Footy Show.<br>He bemoaned the fact that the cup had gone to Sydney and that NSW and SA horses had taken all but one race in the Caulfield program.<br>He was half-serious and played the Sydney-Melbourne rivalry card a few more times with Dye. O'Donnell did the same thing during Nine's spring carnival outings last year and it was just as irrelevant and boring. He was a fine sportsman but should try to stop being a character if his only line is playing the archetypal Victorian.<br>Sam Newman does it so much better ... and he's serious.<br>RUPERT MURDOCH'S attempted takeover of rugby league has done nothing but prove that his News Corporation is able to fritter away more money than a banana republic.<br>A game that used to thrive on red-blooded suburban conflict was never ready for the bold plan of the Super League World Club Challenge. The gap between Australian clubs and the rest meant we got to see a Brisbane-Hunter grand final in Auckland, of all places.<br>Only 8000 bothered to turn up, not a great return on a 22-team, four-nation tournament that the Sydney Morning Herald estimated cost $6 million.<br></font></p>
