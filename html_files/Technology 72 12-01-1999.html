            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ON THE last day of 1998 I was hard at work at the interface, doing the usual things ... deleting spam, yawning at flame wars between students who cannot spell, finding yet another new portal site acting as a shopfront ... and so on.<br>Then, as Banjo Paterson would say, an answer (to my tedium) came directed in a writing unexpected.<br>Not quite, but a package containing a CD with the Red Hat Linux operating system and the Pocketbook manual, ordered online three weeks earlier, were certainly a tonic.<br>As I have been technology-free on Rottnest for the past week, I have not installed Linux to sit side-by-side with Windows yet.<br>But I have had time to RTFM, as they say on the Net (that is Read the Flippin' Manual, or something similar, for the uninitiated).<br>I am both fascinated and a little scared. Linux's exacting commands are a challenge. It is said the OS is user-friendly, but it is very choosy about its friends.<br>However, it appears to promise a return to the days when users were put in control of their computers rather than vice-versa.<br>It also appears to promise fewer crashes - one user is on record as reporting more than 320 trouble-free days of non-stop operation - and a bit more speed with optimum use of the hardware.<br>The biggest plus is that it is considerably cheaper than the $159 that a Windows upgrade will cost. In fact it is free. Users pay for documentation and shipping, not for the operating system.<br>Linux is free because it was developed collectively across the Net by skilled programmers working in the open source tradition which holds that software should be freely accessible to the community.<br>Experienced computer users know all this already. Linux has been developed cooperatively since its invention in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.<br>A lot of newer users may not be aware of it, however. And companies like Microsoft, which control so much of what a typical new user does, would not mind if it stayed that way.<br>Linux - enjoying a surge in popularity because of its endorsement by Netscape last January - rose to even more prominence in November when a memo by a Microsoft engineer was leaked on the Net.<br>The so-called Halloween Documents explain to Microsoft bosses the threat posed by a free Linux and the open source software development community that built it.<br>Linux threatens Microsoft's ambitions for the much-postponed new NT system, now renamed Windows 2000.<br>Interest in Linux is increasing steadily. Salon magazine claims more than five million people have it installed.<br>An International Data Corporation analyst also told Salon that between two million and six million copies of Linux were installed in 1997 alone (compared with 3.8 million new installations of the Macintosh OS in 1997).<br>Microsoft is probably not quaking in its boots ... yet.<br>And at the moment, Linux is not for the faint-hearted. You need to know DOS and understand directory structures at least. Its strength still is in running network servers under the guidance of computer-savvy staff.<br>But at the rate the cooperative nature of the Net works, an attractive, reliable - and very cheap - operating system with an easy-to-use shell is sure to emerge soon for home users.<br>HELP DESK<br>Red Hat:<br>www.redhat.com<br>Halloween Document:<br>www.opensource.org/halloween.html<br>Australian PC magazine<br>(to order Pocketbook online):<br>apcmag.com/shop/<br>Perth Linux Users' Group:<br>plug.linux.org.au<br>Linux Australia:<br>www.linux.org.au<br>Linux Home Page:<br>www.linux.org<br></font></p>
