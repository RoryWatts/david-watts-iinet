            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AFTER 16 weeks, it is impossible to say what the AFL final eight will be.<br>Never mind trying to pick the grand finalists. Every week is a grand final, particularly for Fremantle and West Coast.<br>This is a one-eyed assessment of how the teams stack up as enter- tainment value on TV. It is not nec- essarily a true reflection of their form or finals chances. Teams are mentioned in ladder order and rated out of 10.<br>Geelong - Good value even without Gary Ablett. The defence now matches the pacy attack. Highlight each telecast is Garry Hocking's gutsy work rate. 8.<br>Western Bulldogs - Were solid, competent and professional, but recently the flaws, particularly in defence, have been exploited. Highlight is the marking of Chris Grant. 7.<br>Adelaide - Not bad when firing, but players are liable to hang their heads when put to the sword. Darren Jarman on song is a joy. 6.5.<br>St Kilda - Like the Bulldogs, a surprise packet, but far more exciting and capable of playing with flair. Robert Harvey is always phen- omenal. 8.<br>Brisbane - Getting better and better. For sheer enjoyment of pace and teamwork, this bunch of roo dogs is hard to beat. Jarrod Molloy's bul- locky strength up front is sometimes awesome. 8.5.<br>Sydney - At the SCG there are few better sights than flocks of Swans rampaging forward. Perth youngster Troy Cook is often thrilling to watch, but nothing can be taken away from reliable champions Paul Kelly and Paul Roos. 7.5.<br>Port Adelaide - Added a new dimension to the season by refusing to be an easybeat. Good to see Brayden Lyle directing traffic. 7.<br>North Melbourne - Often a shadow of its premiership team, but also can be among the most exciting to watch, particularly when Glenn Archer and David King are firing. 6.<br>West Coast - Injury has been its ruin. Often in love with the boundary line. Tenacious defence often produces scrappy affairs. Nothing beats the sight of a Peter Matera burst. 5.5.<br>Carlton - Sometimes it plays beautifully, just as it did in flogging Essendon on Saturday. Craig Bradley in the open, Stephen Silvagni marking the impossible, and those Greg Williams handpasses are high- lights. 6.<br>Hawthorn - Competent, gutsy, with lots of potential. Veterans Paul Salmon and John Platten continue to amaze. 5.<br>Fremantle - Can beat anyone and is sometimes breathtaking, but it is still heart-attack material. Andrew Wills flying from nowhere, gutsy Craig Callaghan and the continuous improvement of Kingsley Hunter's forward play are highlights. 7.5.<br>Collingwood - On its day there is no team better to watch. Trouble is it doesn't have many days now. Nathan Buckley is close to perfection sometimes. 5.<br>Essendon - The injuries have told and the Bombers make patchy viewing. Without the silky James Hird, has few highlights. 4.<br>Richmond - Something is broken and the Tigers rarely make good viewing. 3.5.<br>Melbourne - Often dull and slow with occasional brilliance from Jeff Farmer. 2.<br>Umpires - Not a good year. Too many soft kicks in front of goal while chaos upfield is often allowed to go on unpenalised. 3.<br></font></p>
