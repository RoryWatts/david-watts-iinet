            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 9 went from hero to villain in less than 24 hours at the weekend.<br>The station can bask in the reflected glory of the fantastic Cox Plate that it covered on Saturday afternoon.<br>But it deserves truckloads of brickbats for inflicting on us the meaningless one-day clash between Victoria and South Australia on Sunday afternoon.<br>Cricket lovers will need no reminding that at the same time as Richie Benaud and crew were pondering on the donkey drops and wild hoiks from the MCG, Australian batsmen were sewing up the historic Test against Pakistan in Karachi.<br>But Nine - the cricket station - does not believe matches in the sub-continent are worth more than highly sponsored, poorly attended, hit and miss domestic games.<br>So, we will leave them alone with that shame and concentrate instead on the network's high point, the racing.<br>It would have been enough for TV viewers to marvel at the awesome Cox Plate victory of Might And Power.<br>To see the mighty horse surge out of the ruck and break free to lead at the first turn.<br>To watch as jockey Jim Cassidy called for more about 400m out ... and got it.<br>To cheer as Might And Power made short work of the improbable home-straight challenge by Northern Drake.<br>To ponder the comparisons with Tulloch, Kingston Town, and even in moments of madness, Phar Lap.<br>But Nine managed to squeeze in more than that.<br>Straight after the race, with more than 35,000 in the ugly suburban course going mad with delight, Darren Beadman grabbed the man that TV sports fans are led to believe is a grumpy, old recluse.<br>Might And Power's trainer Jack Denham was basically asked the standard sporting question: how do you feel?<br>He did not have to say anything - in fact he spoke very few words - his watery eyes and trembling chin said it all.<br>He was bursting with pride and happiness. After the short chat with Beadman - whose famous career as a champion jockey gets him more than a few scoops at the track - Denham chokingly spoke to a crowd still delirious over Might And Power's win. His message was that the plate was all he wanted.<br>As Melbourne journalist Patrick Smith wrote in The Age, the punters did not care that the media had branded Denham uncommunicative and criticised him for not accepting Might And Power's Caulfield and Melbourne Cups last year.<br>?The racing folk care nought about all that humbug. All they care about is Denham and his horse. And both are champions,? said Smith.<br>Might And Power, Cassidy and Denham gave us one of the best televised sporting events of the year.<br>Racing might be mostly about money, but Denham reminded us that it is also about pride, hard work and the sheer love of the big event.<br>Not like one-day cricket at all.<br></font></p>
