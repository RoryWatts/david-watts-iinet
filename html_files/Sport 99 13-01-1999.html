            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE good news is there is a terrific amount of sport on TV this time of the year. The bad news is that so much of it is familiar and hardly memorable.<br>The time warp feeling has been emphasised by:<br>Channel 7's Garry Wilkinson smoothly introducing first-round match after first-round match at White City.<br>Wally Masur and John Alexander winding up John Fitzgerald, or Fitzgerald and Alexander winding up Masur, or ... pick your combination.<br>The silence of Richie Benaud as the camera lingers on a rude banner just after he has praised the one-day cricket crowd for its ingenuity and humour. (This is especially embarrassing now that most banners poke fun at the Shane Warne-Mark Waugh bookie scandal).<br>The sporting deja vu goes on, sometimes with slight variations - Lleyton Hewitt in the Australian hardcourt final last Sunday for the second successive year.<br>Unfortunately, he lost this time and the bouncy teenager of 1998 looked like a kid who had been told he was going for a Sunday drive with his parents and could not take the Discman or the Gameboy.<br>This feeling that nothing much has changed grows even bigger when you throw in from last year Pat Rafter's second US Open, Adelaide's second successive flag and Robert Harvey's Brownlow mark two.<br>But, thanks to the ghost of Harry Hopman, the repetitive spell was broken last week. Along came Jelena Dokic and the ABC's old-fashioned, advertisement-free coverage of sport.<br>We all know the 15-year-old belted the socks off three highly-regarded players and made a speech worthy of a more mature person when she and Mark Philippoussis accepted the Hopman Cup.<br>And we have no doubt read that her looks and composure will assure her of oodles of sponsorship dollars, which unfortunately seems to define a sportsman's qualities in these avaricious 90s.<br>But the ABC - without the benefit of cricketers skylarking on the beach for Ansett, or a poor Benaud impersonator extolling the virtues of Western Power - was able to show exactly why young Dokic is a champion in waiting.<br>After Australia had beaten Sweden to win the cup, the ABC had lots of time to kill before the mixed doubles. It chose to replay highlights of Dokic beating Sandrine Testud, of France.<br>It chose to show a good deal of them in slow motion, which highlighted her killer eyes.<br>Green flashing eyes, they looked. Always on the ball, never sleepy, ever alert, ready to strike. Definitely the eyes of a tiger.<br>She may make squillions. She may be No.1 one day. God forbid, she may also bow out before her time with injuries to shoulders, elbows, knees, hamstrings, young mind ... take your pick.<br>Right now we should feel privileged to have seen such ferocity combined with such grace.<br>And all without a commercial break.<br></font></p>
