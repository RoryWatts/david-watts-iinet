            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Loch Ness (G)<br>Ted Danson, Joely Richardson, Ian Holm<br>Directed by John Henderson<br>THERE are far worse ways to spend 100 minutes than to goof off in front of Loch Ness. It is a light comedy, light romance and exceedingly light on science.<br>If US scientists applied the same methods to researching life on Mars as Ted Danson's John Dempsey does in his non-hunt for the beastie, then it would be another three billion years before the evidence was extracted from the meteorite in Antarctica.<br>Dempsey is a washed up Los Angeles scientist, broke, divorced and bedevilled by car problems in the land of freeways. His best days are behind him. A fruitless three-year search for the yeti in the wilds of British Columbia flushed away his youthful claim to fame - discovery of a rare species of parasitic wasp from South America.<br>He named the wasp after his former wife. ?It stings, then calls the lawyers.?<br>He is a morose sort, but is given a chance to redeem himself by sweeping Loch Ness to prove once and for all there is nae kelpie ... sorry, no monster. The light Scottish brogue adopted by most of the cast is infectious.<br>That of course makes him as popular as an unattended parcel at the airport and the straight-talking locals are openly hostile once Dempsey's mission is plain.<br>It does not stop them overcharging him of course. This being Scotland there just have to be cliches about money.<br>One of the prime overchargers is the feisty landlady of the pub where Dempsey settles, Joely Richardson's Laura. She is not just feisty, she is a handsome woman with a capital H.<br>The punch of a looming love affair is telegraphed early. One woman should not be allowed the flashing eyes and striking body language of Laura. If Danson was playing Sam the bartender in Cheers he would have been on to her in a flash.<br>But the film lacks that Cheers spark and Danson is too low-key, ideally suited to sitting on a fishing boat equipped with state-of-the-art gear, swigging beer, reading the Glasgow Herald and dangling a line in the loch while his assistant does all the work.<br>Laura has a beguiling nine-year-old daughter, Isabel (Kirsty Graham), however, who gets under Dempsey's skin in the way cute little girls do in Hollywood films. She pushes Dempsey's interest in the monster beyond the straight scientific and his interest in Laura beyond the platonic.<br>Dempsey's main opponent in his mission is the keeper of the loch, the Water Bailiff, played with usual nonchalant ease by the crusty Ian Holm (Chariots of Fire).<br>He is murderously proud of the loch and the mystery of the monster, but unfortunately does not get enough screen time to inject the rather sleepy film with more energy.<br>He does get the last laugh, however, contributing to the only magical minutes Loch Ness offers - sadly they are the final 10 only.<br>Comparisons with another light romantic comedy set in the wilds of Scotland, Local Hero, leave Loch Ness floundering.<br>The characters are not richly painted, the hero is too sleepy and there are far too few eccentricities to lift Loch Ness to Hero's level. The only winner in a theoretical battle between the two is Joely Richardson for her strength.<br>The soundtrack is as low key and uninteresting as Danson and the scenery, though beautiful, is presented to mask the superficial plot rather than enhance the drama.<br></font></p>
