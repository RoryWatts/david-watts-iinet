            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TOUGH State-based censorship of the Internet in Australia has been averted for the time being, according to a leading user group.<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia spokesman Irene Graham said yesterday that WA appeared likely to go it alone on censoring the Net.<br>All other States would lay off cyberspace and leave talks about its regulation to the Federal Government, she said.<br>A spokesman for WA Fair Trading Minister Cheryl Edwardes - responsible for Internet issues here - had no comment.<br>It is known that WA legislation is well thought of by Net user groups, such as the WA Internet Association, because it has been based on sound knowledge of the medium and is regarded as fairly non-interventionist.<br>Ms Graham said the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General last week rejected contentious NSW censorship plans, put forward as an attempt to have uniform national legislation.<br>It is understood the SCAG meeting discussed the Net unofficially. The two-day meeting dealt mostly with film and TV.<br>The NSW plans outraged Internet user groups and most other States because they were considered draconian and ignorant.<br>NSW Attorney-General Jeff Shaw originally wanted Net users who transmitted or received material considered unfit for 15-year-olds to be subject to harsh penalties, including $10,000 fines and six-month jail terms.<br>Net users, led by the EFA, a voluntary group, said these plans were unworkable and would turn the Net into a kindergarten, making it illegal to send moderately steamy e-mail love letters or view great works of art.<br>Most States, including WA, disavowed the NSW plans before last week's SCAG meeting. Mrs Edwardes told the WA Internet Association the plans were a dead issue.<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority's release of guidelines two weeks ago calling for self-regulation and a code of conduct, and the defeat of the US Communications Decency Act on the grounds of free speech, were key to the rejection of the NSW plans.<br>Rejection of the plans was hailed as a victory by the EFA.<br>?This is a great day for Internet democracy in Australia. The voice of reason finally appears to be winning against the voice of ignorance,? the EFA said in a statement on the Internet.<br></font></p>
