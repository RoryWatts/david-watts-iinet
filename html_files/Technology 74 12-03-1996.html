            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PARENTS now have a wide variety of ways to block their children's access to what they consider unsavoury Internet sites.<br>The growing push against Net censorship in the US and Australia has, paradoxically, unleashed an increasing number of ?filth blockers?.<br>This software is available for trial downloads all over the Net, and for as little as $30 parents have a choice.<br>With names such as Net Nanny, Surf Watch, Cyber Patrol and CYBERsitter, there can be no doubting the self-regulatory flavour and fervour of the software, much of which has come into vogue during the long debate about US regulation of the Net.<br>A similar argument is brewing in Australia as the Australian Broadcasting Authority considers submissions about regulation of online services.<br>Outcries about the availability of pornography have prompted the ABA inquiry.<br>Assertions that Net users are responsible enough to regulate content without intervention from government are equally responsible for the outbreak of blocking software.<br>Cyber Patrol software, the most effective I have tested so far, promises it can block access to more than 7500 areas with sexually explicit material.<br>It has a daunting user interface at first, but this is because it is so flexible.<br>Parents or teachers can set the hours that the software can control access to the computer, build in their own no-go sites and override Cyber Patrol's own no-go areas if it is thought they are so stringent as to actually block good material.<br>The software's strength can be seen by the fact that US telecom giant AT&T chose it to be a built-in package for its 4.3 million WorldNet users.<br>Online giants CompuServe and Prodigy have also built Cyber Patrol into their Net packages.<br>Cyber Patrol's effectiveness can be seen in this little trial:<br>I typed ?nude celebrities? into a search engine and was given a list of sites that promised either a nude, a celebrity or a nude celebrity. Cyber Patrol would not let me access any of those sites.<br>The mere mention of sex, nudity and the like is enough for Cyber Patrol to deny access.<br>The blockers apply to FTP sites, IRC lines and especially to Usenet newsgroups, perhaps the sites containing most explicit material.<br></font></p>
