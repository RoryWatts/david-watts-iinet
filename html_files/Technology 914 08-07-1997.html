            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">You have to worry about some people. An old English saying goes something like: ?They're all mad "cept me and thee ? and I have my doubts about thee.?<br>This was formulated well before the World Wide Web of the Internet.<br>Indeed, once upon a time the only way to check what went on many people's minds was to sneak a peek at their reading matter.<br>If you saw copies of the Marquis de Sade or Lady Chatterley's Lover, you might suspect a few things, depending on your own taste. A library literally choked with Carter Brown and Barbara Cartland would suggest other types of character.<br>But you could only guess.<br>Now the Web has thrown open the doors to what really lurks in people's minds. Tim Berners-Lee might have had his mind firmly on global access to texts on nuclear physics when he got the idea for the Web in 1990, but few could have guessed the sheer ratbaggery that would emerge.<br>Looking back through copies of The West's former Net pages, WestWeb, I notice pieces about some sites that have elevated trivia to new heights ? or depths.<br>One was the sdrawkcaB page which enables surfers to key in a URL to see their desired site rendered totally in reverse.<br>Thus Yahoo becomes oohaY and still works.<br>Then there was Slap a Spice Girl, which gives the punter the chance to swat members of the popular, under-dressed pop group as they stick their heads out of a series of holes on-screen. Ahh, the wonders of Java.<br>My favourite was Bagpipes go to the Movies, where two Scots have compiled an ever-growing list of movies in which the pipes have been played, the tunes that were played and by whom.<br>Now an alert reader called Paul has e-mailed me a list of his favourite sites. A quick squiz suggests the Web's ability to open channels of communication has taken a few more weird detours.<br>High on his list was the Bert is Evil page. This is in stark black and white with a shadowy picture of the Sesame Street puppet complete with police ID number.<br>Bert - alleged mate of Ernie - does look evil. To confirm this, the site's creator has several links to interviews with key characters who have decided to spill the beans about Bert's drug addiction and violent nature.<br>They include Ernie (who lives in fear of Bert's rages), Kermit and killer cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer.<br>Beloved toys take another dive at the Xena Meets Barbie page which is a series of pictures showing an imagined screen test for the famous Barbie doll and the Xena, Warrior Princess doll.<br>All goes swimmingly for the first two frames with Barbie saying her hobbies include curing world hunger through fashion.<br>But a toy dinosaur intrudes in the third frame. Barbie mistakes it for a dog and Xena runs away. It all ends in tears.<br>Great minds in cyberspace seem to have taken a shine to Barbie. There are dozens of sites extolling the virtues of collecting the plastic princess. One leads to a very funny couple of pages of jokes about Barbie, Ken and GI Joe. Unfortunately, they aren't publishable in a family newspaper.<br>The growth of the Web and such publishing enables us, then, to change the old saying at the beginning of the column slightly.<br>?They're all mad "cept me and thee ? and I have my doubts about thee ? and me for that matter.?<br>Help desk<br>sdrawkcaB: www.smeg.com/backwards<br>Slap a Spice Girl: www.head-space.com/Urban75/spice.html<br>Bagpipes go to the Movies: www.ems.psu.edu/ ~fraser/PipesMovies.html#Top<br>Bert is Evil: fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm<br>Barbie humour: d.armory.com/ ~zenugirl/barbiehumour.html<br>Xena and Barbie: ourworld.compuserve.com/<br>homepages/racoon/xena1.htm<br></font></p>
