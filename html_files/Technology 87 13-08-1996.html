            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOMETIMES the best thing about Windows 95 is that it does not take long to uninstall.<br>The much hyped Microsoft operating system is nearly a year old, but instead of being a familiar package it retains an air of mystery to many users.<br>When things go wrong, the mostly friendly and attractive graphic user interface can be as uncompromising as Tony Lockett going for the ball.<br>For most home users with a new PC, 95 is easy. It does what it is told, usually quickly and effectively. But if a user wants to experiment, try new software and give the much vaunted multi-tasking a reasonable trial, then the capabilities of what could have been a good PC are pushed to the limit.<br>The World Wide Web has many resources to help frustrated Win95 users.<br>Most are the result of question and answer forums that have yielded positive results, allowing users to fine tune systems themselves either cheaply or at no expense at all.<br>One of the best is Windows 95 Annoyances, a constantly expanding repository of troubleshooting guides and fine-tuning manuals.<br>The site was begun by Creative Element, a US Web group, because it found so many holes in the beta version of 95 that Microsoft seemed not to care about. Readers have submitted the majority of material to this site and continue to do so.<br>Though aimed at intermediate and advanced users, the site has plenty to offer ordinary users.<br>Memory management is the main issue in many Win95 problems, according to how-to guides at the site.<br>Instead of allowing the operating system to rule your PC's memory management, the site tells how user input in the My Computer/System/Performance/Virtual Memory interface can cut activity on the hard drive.<br>One maddening feature of Win95 on an 8MB RAM system is the constant rattle and hum of the hard disk drive.<br>Following Annoyance's guidelines, it is possible to cut this in half. Purely cosmetic annoyances like the mostly unused icons for Microsoft Network and Microsoft Exchange appearing on the desktop are addressed.<br>Users can download a Microsoft product called PowerToys which will drop those icons and also allow removal of the pointless arrows from desktop shortcuts.<br>Annoyances gives hints on how to rev up the Explorer directory, adding to the seemingly useless Send To function available on the right mouse click.<br>The most maddening problem of all - the fatal exception error that stops the PC, turns the screen blue and the air blue with foul language - gets good attention, too.<br>There are many possible reasons for this error which appears to stem from the way Win95 uses memory.<br>New RAM, expanded RAM, registry clean-up programs and new motherboards are all offered as possible solutions.<br>And Annoyances tells users how to make the gullible believe they have actually updated to Windows96. It all lies in the bitmaps behind the opening and shutdown screens.<br>An equally helpful site is Windows95.com which prides itself on always having the best and latest shareware.<br>URLs:<br>User Windows95 resources:<br>Newsgroup - alt.windows95<br>URLs:<br>Windows95.com - www.windows95.com<br>Windows95 Annoyances - www.creativelement.com/win95ann<br>Microsoft resources:<br>Microsoft Knowledge Base - www.microsoft.com/kb/<br></font></p>
