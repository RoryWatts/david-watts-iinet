            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NEVER doubt the world becomes crazier with each passing day. Two events in the past week have made me check my reality monitor was still switched on.<br>One was early on Monday when Steve Waugh led Australia to a cricket World Cup victory against the West Indies by being as lively as a wombat at high noon.<br>The other was the great chook debate as our politicians grappled with the reshaped goods and services tax.<br>First the cricket. Commentator Bill Lawry said last summer: ?Cricket is a simple game . . . it just gets a bit complicated at times.? It sounded silly, yet profound at the same time. Maybe Lawry could see the future and divine that the accountants, lawyers and public relations people would draw up a set of rules for the World Cup in keeping with the age we live in . . . that is, baffling, unnecessarily complicated and ruled by the calculator.<br>Being from the ?older I get, the better I was? school, I remember cricket as a very simple game. The aim was to score more runs and take more wickets and do it faster than your opponent.<br>To see how the 90s has intruded on a once-simple game, look no further than these excerpts from the official rules of the World Cup: ?A team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team, the average runs per over scored against that team - see 11.2(c) for the group matches and 11.3(c) for the Super Six matches. Only those matches where results were achieved and where the D/L method for recalculating the target score was not utilised will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations.?<br>That is just one paragraph in a set of rules that takes up about four foolscap pages and runs to 12 sections.<br>Now GST and chooks. Opposition Leader Kim Beazley caused the tizz of all tizzes when he seized the list of GST-free food put out by the Government and the Australian Democrats and focused on the humble chook.<br>He said: ?But the list of foods issued by the Australian Democrats yesterday expressly includes "whole cooked chickens' as GST-free. (Treasurer Peter) Costello's answer raises the scenario in which a whole barbecued chicken sold from a fast food outlet would be taxable but the same chicken sold by a supermarket would be tax free.?<br>In the past few days, the anti-GST forces have put cakes through the mixer. Labor's Simon Crean has even thrown a packaged lettuce down in anger while shouting at Mr Costello.<br>What do we do? Let them eat cake, as Marie Antoinette once suggested? But what will we pay for the decoration and the baking or even the flour?<br>I may have found an antidote to this growing craziness. It came in a message on the front page of the regular newsletter from John XXIII College last week. I have also found it at dozens of pages on the Internet.<br>Sadly, I can reproduce only a fraction of it here because of the 90s malaise of lack of time and space. But it is called The Paradox of Our Age, by an unknown author, and it starts like this: ?We have taller buildings but shorter tempers; wider freeways but narrower viewpoints; we spend more but have less; we buy more but enjoy it less.<br>?We have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences but less time; we have more degrees but less sense; more knowledge but less judgment; more experts but more problems; more medicine but less wellness.?<br>After 500 or so more wise words, it ends: ?It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the stockroom.?<br>Food for thought this long weekend . . . but will it be GST-free?I intend to put the entire work on my Web site at: www.iinet.net.au/watto<br></font></p>
