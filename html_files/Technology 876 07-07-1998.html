            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE has sent out conflicting messages about its browser war with Microsoft.<br>Chief executive Jim Barksdale told the Washington Post late last month that as far as he was concerned the battle to see who dominated the window on the World Wide Web was over.<br>His company received no revenue for its Navigator or Communicator packages now they were given away free in response to the intense campaign from Microsoft which bundles Internet Explorer free with Windows.<br>Compare this with 1996 when Netscape made nearly $160 million from browser sales.<br>On the same day that Mr Barksdale seemingly conceded the future of the Web to Internet Explorer, Netscape's co-founder Marcus Andreesen - now the company's executive vice-president of products - told the BBC that his browser was not threatened by the new Windows 98 and its included IE browser.<br>Both men appeared to be saying opposite things about Communicator/Navigator, but were in fact emphasising their company's continuing drift away from making the browser the centre of operations.<br>Since January, when Netscape announced heavy losses and big job cuts, the company has been working on strategies to make it less browser-dependent.<br>These have dovetailed with Microsoft becoming embroiled in the anti-trust case filed by the US Department of Justice for being too browser-centred.<br>The Justice Department is seeking to make Microsoft ensure that computer manufacturers put the Netscape browser alongside IE on the Windows desktop to give users a choice.<br>Netscape's new strategy is to try to make money in two ways: by building software for enterprises, typically corporations that are trying to use Web technology for communicating with their customers and partners, and by serving as a portal, or an entry gate to the Web.<br>Operators of portals earn money through a combination of advertising, selling services and referring customers to other partners.<br>In practice a Web portal simply looks like an intense home page dominated by a search engine and many indices carefully grouped into saleable categories.<br>?I'm building a business that is not dependent on staying right in Microsoft's headlights,? Mr Barksdale said.<br>Microsoft, however, already builds enterprise software that competes with Netscape's offerings, and it is developing what it hopes will be a compelling portal for the Web to compete with Netscape's fledgling Netcenter.<br>Mr Andreesen said Microsoft's bundling of Web technology with Windows represented more of a threat to traditional businesses rather than to Netscape and its browser.<br>?I think the Department of Justice case and all these discussions about Microsoft is really going to be much more around more traditional industries, like banking and travel services and real estate and news,? he said.<br>?This is because Microsoft is going after the traditional industries themselves as a competitor very aggressively and I think that's going to be a very interesting story over the next few years ... how traditional industries and companies respond.?<br>As a result, the battle of the browsers was being transformed into a struggle between competing online services.<br>?We're seeing Microsoft and America Online and Yahoo! and a whole series of companies including Netscape basically competing to build networks of users in the online world to help service hubs for electronic commerce,? he said.<br>?That's really where the browser battle is going and I think we have an excellent chance there.?<br>He told business leaders at a conference in London that Netscape had repositioned and reinvented itself after the browser battle.<br>Netscape is still the world's number one browser, according to the latest figures from the IDC research firm, which gave it 50.5 per cent compared with IE's 40 per cent.<br>Although this share has dropped nearly 20 per cent since IE made its surge late in 1996, Netscape believes the dominant position and the fact that many users have easy access to the company home page will drive them to the Netcenter page.<br>Businesses who choose to join the Netcenter will then benefit by being associated with Netscape and will pay for the privilege.<br>Netcenter is believed to have produced $50 million for Netscape in the last quarter. The company also made $160 million from the sale of other software.<br></font></p>
