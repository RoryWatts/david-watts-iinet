            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Reader Rick Owen of Northam is to blame. He passed on a poem to @ccess which we published last week. It was in the style of a Dr Seuss children's rhyme but had nothing to do with cats in hats. It was about computing; a modern fable if you like.<br>Just to refresh memories, it started like this:<br>If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,<br>And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort ?It was very clever and very anonymous like an awful lot of material available on the Net. I have seen this poem before but have no recollection where.<br>It could have been on a page during a fairly purposeless but rewarding browse of the Web. It is more likely I read it in a Usenet newsgroup where Netizens thrash out subjects dear to their hearts like football, motherboards and the relative merits of Pamela Anderson as opposed to Sandra Bullock.<br>But I fancy I picked it up as a passive member of a mailing list or e-mail discussion group. These are a little like newsgroups but are more tightly controlled and intimate.<br>People of similar persuasions subscribe to a discussion group and are placed on a list of recipients. Any member of that list can then communicate with the whole group, simply by sending e-mail to a group address.<br>At various times I have been a member of groups discussing Telstra policies, brain tumours, media ownership and one which exists simply because its members regard themselves as wrinklier than Generation Xers and feel they have a right to discuss computing without being made to feel foolish by the youngsters.<br>It is a pastime I recommend heartily, not least for the simple fact that you actually receive e-mail. One of the mortifying experiences I remember when I connected to the Net two years ago was that I did not get any mail for the first month ? except the bill from the ISP.<br>It was like being a wallflower. I had no ambition to become an Internet Relay Chatter after dipping into the waters and seeing them dense with far younger types, often with attitood.<br>So it was the lonely hearts route if you like.<br>Like the Net phenomenon itself, it is hard to compare discussion groups with anything in thenon-Net world.<br>It is a little like having many pen-pals, except they can respond to your bleatings within minutes ? if they are at their screens when you are. It is a little like getting regular newsletters, except that they arrive daily and can be opinionated, funny, sad or just plain weird.<br>One of the interesting side-effects is that by making virtual friends by e-mail you actually broaden your experience of life. It may be vicarious but sharing knowledge, humour and drama can put some important conversational weapons at your disposal in the real world.<br>Like Rick Owen, the Dr Seuss sender, I find the creation of an ever-growing pool of humour hard to resist. And like the Dr Seuss poem, the following tidbits passed on by discussion group members are computer-related.<br>But, even for non-nerds and geeks, there are some horrifying resemblances to real life experiences in some of these one-liners. For example:Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes.C:\WINDOWS C:\WINDOWS\GO C:\PC\CRAWL C:\DOS C:\DOS\RUN RUN\DOS\RUNAccess denied nah nah na nah nah!Bad, bad command! Sit! Stay! Staaay ? ( Why doesn't DOS ever say excellent command or filename?)Ethernet (n): something used to catch the etherbunny.SENILE.COM found ? Out Of Memory.Who is General Failure and why is he reading my disk?All computers wait at the same speed.<br>HELP DESK<br>Local mailing lists: listmaster.iinet.net.au/<br>Yahoo mailing lists list: www.yahoo.com.au/<br>Computers_and_Internet/Internet/Mailing_Lists/<br>More information: www.webreference.com/talk.html<br></font></p>
