            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">New releases<br>TWIN TOWN<br>Dylan Thomas once wrote that ?Swansea is the graveyard of ambition? which perhaps explains why one-time Swansea resident Kevin Allen goes for broke with Twin Town. Clearly determined that his debut feature would not be his last, Allen uses every frame of this Trainspotting-style black comedy about a pair of glue-sniffing car-thief brothers (Llyr and Rhys Ifans) who take on revenge on Swansea's Mr Big to proclaim his talent. For much of the film he succeeds wildly, mainly on the strength of the brothers' head-spinning anarchic behaviour. They do wheelies with a stolen car on a prized soccer pitch, spray a karaoke contestant with urine in the middle of her version of I Will Survive (she doesn't) and play a game of golf while snorting cocaine. Unfortunately, as the film moves relentlessly toward its violent ending, with a Godfather-inspired dog's head left in a bed, it all starts feeling like a series of hip, post-Tarantino, post-Trainspotting effects for their own sake. It doesn't take you very far but there are some pretty good laughs along the way. Screening at the Luna. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY<br>Life in Paris, if movies are to be believed, is an endless round of cafes, croissants, intellectual conversations, fashion parades and l'amour fou. The other side of the story, according to Cedric Klapisch, is that Parisians are as desperately lonely as the citizens of any big city. In his third feature When The Cat's Away, writer-director Klapisch takes one of these big-city sophisticates, a loner make-up artist named Chloe (Garance Clavel), and sends her out into the world in search of her missing moggy. This search brings Chloe into contact with neighbours she barely knows, even though she has been living in the same place for years. Among those who join forces to search for the prodigal pussy are a group of elderly ladies and a dim-witted Arab. The quest for the cat, however, is of no real consequence; Klapisch is really interested in bringing together two worlds which exist side-by-side yet somehow fail to touch. Shot in a documentary style with lovely naturalistic performances, When The Cat's Away is rare among recent French offerings - delicate, touching and heart-felt. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated (Mark Naglazas)<br>Recent releases<br>ANACONDA<br>Despite an obviously big budget and impressive digital effects, Anaconda is very much in the tradition of The Blob and The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes - as funny as it is scary with the laughs coming simultaneously with the screams as the dinosaur-sized anaconda reaches in and snaffles another delicacy from the floating dining table. If you thought Mike Tyson had a nasty bite, wait until you get a load of this slithering killing machine. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BATMAN & ROBIN<br>In this fourth installment of Batman, director Joel Schumacher seems intent on reviving the campy hi-jinks of the 60s TV series. Gone is the existential gloom of the Burton-directed Batmans: this is Batman Lite. The problem is that Schumacher's movie lacks the panache and punch in performances, dialogue and direction required to pull off the campy style. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>BEAN<br>While Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean works extremely well on television, where he exists in his own bizarre parallel universe, putting him into the real world with something resembling reality and fleshing out his character causes problems. Still, Bean is hilarious in sequences, especially when his bumbling ?art expert? attempts to correct his excruciating destruction of a $50 million painting. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST<br>This fanciful play on the classic tale Beauty and the Beast about a big-haired beauty teacher who stumbles into a job tutoring the children of the president of a fictitious East European republic is hardly a challenge for Fran Drescher, who does the same schtick week in and week out on television. She teeters around in high heels and figure-hugging pants, brightening up the president's morbid castle with not just her clothing but her colourful (but somewhat inane) ideas on everything from romance to politics. Timothy Dalton is suitably stand-offish as the ?beastly? president but the pair lack on-screen chemistry. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>CHASING AMY<br>Precocious New Jersey writer-director Kevin Smith follows Mallrats, his erratic follow-up to the cult sensation Clerks - his most mature, most personal work to date - a sassy, street-smart romantic comedy about a comic book artist (played by Ben Affleck) who falls for a gorgeous, worldly lesbian (Joey Lauren Adams). While Smith isn't much of visual stylist, preferring to anchor his camera and let the characters talk, fortunately they're among the most entertaining talkers in movies today, running off at the mouth about everything from Superman to the dangers of cunnilingus. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE CELLULOID CLOSET<br>Homosexuality has been a part of movies since the days of Griffith and DeMille, only we've been too blinkered to notice. After seeing this wonderfully revealing compilation documentary you'll watch every old movie with a sharp eye for the wink, the walk and the gesture that will let you in on the big secret. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE LIARS<br>Elie Chouraquie's The Liars is, by turns, a comedy, thriller and an essay on the nature of truth. Set in the world of the French film industry, with Jean-Hugues Anglade playing a director who turns his real-life tale into his next project, The Liars is funny, clever and stylish in a way the French can only be. It should also appeal to those who enjoyed the surprise hit The Apartment, which is also playing at the Luna. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>Still showing<br>JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE<br>TV Toolman Man Tim hits the nail on the head a couple of times with his follow-up to The Santa Clause. For the most part, however, Jungle 2 Jungle is all thumbs - a slack, slapdash remake of the French hit comedy Un Indien dans la Ville. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>LADY AND THE TRAMP<br>It took nearly 20 years from conception by Walt himself to bring to the big screen this bumpy love story of the upper-class cocker spaniel and the mongrel from the wrong side of the tracks, the Disney deviation from much-loved fairy tales and folk stories, and it has remained a a children's favourite since. The songs by Peggy Lee and the humorous characterisation of animals - especially the dreadful cats - are the highlights. The story and homely morals are pure 50s Americana and the film pales a little compared with more recent Disney efforts - Aladdin, Toy Story and the Little Mermaid particularly - but it is cute. Rated G (David Watts)<br>LIAR, LIAR<br>There are some side-splitting scenes in this Jim Carrey comedy about a compulsive liar and lawyer forced to tell the truth when his son's birthday wish comes true. However, the film relies too heavily on Carrey's rubbery facial distortions for easy laughs. Strictly for Carrey fans. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>THE LOST WORLD<br>There are at least three different films squeezed inside this sequel to Jurassic Park - an Hatari!-inspired man-as-predator movie, a chase movie with T-Rex making like T2 and, finally, King Kong by way of Godzilla. It's an awkward fit but, in one gob-smacking sequence after another, Steven Spielberg shows that his three-year lay-off hasn't dulled his ability to make us jump out of our seats at the appropriate moment. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>SWINGERS<br>Writer-star Jon Favreau uses the cliches of the post-Tarantino guy movie - the coffee shops and silver-tongued talk about nothing, Vegas and the hipster's love of kitsch, the macho swagger and beautiful ?babies? - to tell us something about masculine self-delusion and insecurity in the city of broken dreams. Funny, touching and with a whiff of Woody Allen. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>VOLCANO<br>There are thrills and laughs to be had when molten lava bubbles up out of LA's Le Brea Tar Pits and oozes down fashionable Wilshire Boulevard. Unfortunately, all those fossilised disaster movie cliches - the hero with domestic problems, the screaming teenager, the plucky dog, the slow-thinking city officials - pour out at the same time, threatening to melt our brains if we get too close. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>WALLACE & GROMIT<br>Tom Hanks might have two Oscars on his mantlepiece but he's beaten hands down by a guy named Nick Park. Nick Who? He's the genius behind Wallace and Gromit, the cheese-loving inventor and his brainy dog. All three Wallace and Gromit adventures - A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave - are the same program for the first time. It's worth noting that A Grand Day out was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to Creature Comforts, also directed by Park. Screening at the Luna. Rated G<br></font></p>
