            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A PERTH-BASED search engine is attracting so many hits that Netscape wants to make it one of its three recommended Australian World Wide Web sites.<br>Aussie.com, whose search engine is catchily named aussie.com.au (just think of the cricket anthem Come on Aussie Come On) is now the most visited in Australia, according to cooperator Brian Fletcher.<br>He says Netscape has asked if aussie.com.au can handle a million hits a day, the figure the browser software giant predicts will be attracted by placement in the top three list.<br>Netscape placement is part of a strategy to lift the company's Australian profile when it sets up regional headquarters in Melbourne.<br>Mr Fletcher is confident Aussie.com can deliver. The company is now implementing a bigger, faster engine which he terms a ?super Aussie search?.<br>Aussie.com was set up in 1994 by self-described Net enthusiast Rudy Vogelsang, who called his Web index the AAA index.<br>?Pure altruism was his motive, plus, it was a vehicle for his brilliant Web page making skills,? Mr Fletcher said. ?It demanded more and more of his time just to keep it maintained.<br>?I was invited in as an investor. I provided funding for upgraded hardware and programming.?<br>The company is betting on the Web becoming a thriving commercial enterprise.<br>?We are concentrating on building the best index, with the highest traffic, which we have already achieved,? Mr Fletcher says.<br>The importance of aussie.com.au is that it searches only for Australian Web pages and offers Australian businesses reasonably cheap advertising on the Net.<br>URL: www.aussie.com.au<br></font></p>
