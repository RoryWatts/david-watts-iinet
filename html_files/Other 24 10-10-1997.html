            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I HAVE been reading a bit about memory loss this week, but forget exactly why.<br>Perhaps it had something to do with the news about former US president Ronald Reagan. If you recall, Ronnie Raygun, the B-movie actor, led the free world from 1980 to 1988.<br>Ronnie does not recall it, however. He is 86 and suffers Alzheimer's disease that has degenerated to the point where he cannot now remember his days as the most powerful man on the planet.<br>According to news reports from California, Mr Reagan is still pretty active. He plays golf and gets around but is happily surprised at the number of people who recognise him.<br>He remembers only wife Nancy with any clarity apparently.<br>Maybe it wasn't the Reagan story . . . bear with me while I try to remember . . . maybe it was the piece of inscrutable wisdom I read in a work by Thomas Cleary called The Spirit of Tao.<br>He told of a man named Hua-tzu who suffered from forgetfulness when he reached middle age. When on the road he would forget to walk and at home he would forget to sit down, for example.<br>His family hired a Confucian healer who, in due course, cured him. When Hua-tzu became hungry he now ate, when he became tired he slept, and so on.<br>But he also became furious. He threw his wife out of the house, punished his children, and went after the Confucian with an axe.<br>Asked the famous Pauline Hanson question, ?Please explain?, Hua-tzu said:"In my past forgetfulness I was clear and free, unaware even of the existence or nonexistence of heaven and earth. Now I am suddenly conscious, all these decades of gain and losses, sorrows and joys, likes and dislikes, suddenly occur to me in a welter of confusion. I am afraid that future gains and losses, sorrows and joys, likes and dislikes, will disturb my mind like this. Will I ever have a moment's forgetfulness again??<br>I guess there is a lesson there, but I forget what.<br>ANOTHER experience may have been the catalyst for this interest in memory loss. It happened while flying back from Melbourne recently after the urgent business trip that happily coincided with the AFL grand final, a top NBL game, some dreadful racing at Moonee Valley and the opening of the Rembrandt exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria.All that made me completely forget what urgent business I had to conduct.<br>But the flight home: there we were, 150 or so composed souls high above the Nullarbor, fighting the raging westerlies.<br>It is now a guaranteed part of trans-continental air travel that entertainment has to be provided even for we peasants in economy.<br>Bear in mind that all this was shown on Qantas, the national airline whose kangaroo symbol is just about an Australian icon. Homesick singers and athletes still call Australia home in those richly patriotic TV ads.<br>So what did we see on the in-flight TV? Unfortunately I remember.<br>1. An American movie called Buddy that appeared to be about the social interaction of people and gorillas.<br>2. The US sitcom Seinfeld, which is full of Manhattan smartness.<br>3. Another US sitcom, Mad About You, full of New York wit.<br>4. Yet another US sitcom, called Friends, which I think is set in New York and is all the rage.<br>5. A 1979 episode of the once-hilarious US show Saturday Night Live which featured a reasonably young Rolling Stones (Keith Richards and Charlie Watts had hardly any grey hairs) and the long-dead John Belushi of Blues Brothers fame. The show was not very funny because all the jokes were about issues that were topical in the US 18 years ago. They even had a skit sending up President Jimmy Carter, who lost to Reagan, who can't even remember . . . it was so long ago.<br>Harrumph. Thank you Qantas the truly Australian airline for that dose of Coca-Colonisation.<br>When I stepped off the plane I was surprised to see not the Empire State Building, but sleepy, beautiful Perth resting in the scrub. Qantas certainly forgot its Australian roots.<br></font></p>
