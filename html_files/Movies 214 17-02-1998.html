Milne may be turning in his grave at what Disney has done to his creative masterpiece Winnie the Pooh. But there are few complaints among the target audience - children (and often their parents). Pooh, the bear of very little brain, his minder Christopher Robin, Tigger, Piglet, Owl and the rest, sprang to literary life in 1926 as the product of bedtime stories that Milne told his son Christopher. Disney bought the rights to the Pooh stories and characters and animated their adventures - occasionally remaining faithful to the Milne originalsThis site devotes much of its copious space to the animated versions, but has much on the origins of Pooh too. Tigger the toy tiger gets almost equal billing because the site creator's wife is said to be bananas about him.
