            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF YOU want to be politically correct, a lot of material on the Internet is beyond the threshold of belief.<br>It would be unparliamentary to say there were lies and unprincipled liars peddling them in cyberspace.<br>But that is the sad truth.<br>If you connected only recently, chances are you have received your first virus alert e-mail already. I receive a lot of worried correspondence from new users, asking whether the warning they have received not to touch e-mail on penalty of a hard drive crash, could possibly be true.<br>In 99 per cent of the cases, the unfortunate newbies have been the subject of a hoax. The latest warning going around tells of dire consequences if you download a screensaver called Budsaver.<br>?If you download this file someone from the Internet will get your screen name and password,? says the virus alert.<br>Maybe, maybe not. It seems unlikely. But in any case, no one should open an e-mail attachment containing a program sent by someone they do not know.<br>It is not the e-mail that will contaminate their computer, it is the attached program. When in doubt, delete the message.<br>Even if you know the sender, run a virus-checking program.<br>Hoax virus alerts seem to be some ritual initiation ceremony for Net users. That is not to say that anyone can be complacent once they've gained some experience on the super highway, however.<br>In the past fortnight both Microsoft and Netscape have revealed that some of their e-mail packages are in danger of contamination from malicious users who send extremely long file names (more than 200 characters).<br>The program bug can be exploited on the Communicator Messenger package from Netscape and both Outlook Express and Outlook98 from Microsoft. Microsoft has posted a patch to try to fix the loophole.<br>But e-mail contamination is rare. An excellent resource for checking hoaxes and a humorous history of their life on the Net can be found at the Don't Spread that Hoax site.<br>More malicious than hoax e-mails are the thousands of pages of blatantly unreliable information dressed up at respectable-looking web sites.<br>Veteran United States correspondent Pierre Salinger caused a sensation last year when he announced that he had discovered documents on the Internet proving that TWA's flight 770 to Paris (which exploded minutes after taking off from New York) was the victim of friendly fire from a US missile test.<br>The document was an Internet forgery.<br>Much of the earlier reporting on President Clinton's alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky was driven by a cyclone of gossip on the web. The notorious online ?journalist? Matt Drudge has become a celebrity for presenting the unreliable to a growing gullible audience at his Drudge Report site.<br>The millennium bug is causing barely controlled hysteria, which in a great deal of cases, particularly for home users, is unwarranted.<br>One web creator called Uncle Dave is dispensing outrageous advice at his Survival Centre, including warning Net users to move to the country with full emergency supplies at the turn of the century.<br>Medical hoaxes are everywhere too. Chances are you have heard of the boy with cancer who needs postcards and e-mail from around the world.<br>He doesn't.<br>As many of these medi-hoaxes as possible are exposed at an excellent site called Quackwatch.<br>The big problem is the sheer quantity of information. The thousands of hits produced by search engines offer an illusion of authority which is undeserved.<br>More than the real world, the message to the Internet user has to be Buyer Beware.<br>Helpdesk<br>Email security bug fix:<br>www.microsoft.com/outlook/default.asp<br>Don't Spread that Hoax:<br>www.nonprofit.net/hoax/hoax.html<br>Survival Center:<br>www.survival-center.com<br>Quackwatch:<br>www.quackwatch.com<br></font></p>
