            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE cliche says a week is a long time in politics. How about 3½ months?<br>The day after John Howard's coalition won the Federal election, The West Australian sent an e-mail to the ABC asking why the national broadcaster's foray into publishing up-to-date poll results on the World Wide Web had been so disappointing.<br>The ABC site had promised much, particularly as it was linked to the best results service in the country.<br>But thousands of surfers abandoned their computers for the television on election night, March 2, when the ABC Web site failed to update results after a promising first hour.<br>Now in June, with John Howard Prime Minister for more than 100 days, the ABC has responded.<br>Cinnamon Pollard, manager of the ABC multimedia unit, apologised for the delay in responding to the March 3 query, and admitted there had been some technical difficulties at the site.<br>?It has been concluded that a combination of the dynamic updating of the election results to the server, the capacity of the server to process this information and the bandwidth limitations of the connection to the Internet resulted in a number of requests being turned away on the night,? Mr Pollard said in an e-mail message.<br>The ABC's server and Net connection had never been tested to such an extent before and there was no precedent to guess at the number of hits the site would get.<br>In short, it could not stand the pressure.<br>The ABC results site was still one of the most popular election sites visited and linked to during the campaign.<br></font></p>
