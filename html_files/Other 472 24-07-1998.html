            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE SPEND an inordinate amount of our lifetimes pursuing the trivial. One of those pursuits is trying to put names to things.<br>It starts as early as childhood for most of us. You have to work out the names for the creatures who give you comfort. One is gorgeous and smells of sugar and spice and all things nice. It can be named Mummy.<br>The other moans all the time about something called ?you idiot umpire?. It can be called Hey You.<br>Sometimes billy lids find it hard to get the right names for things. It is not rare for a Hey You to be confronted by a three or four-year-old with a question like this: ?Hey You. How come your front bottom is always bigger in the mornings??<br>Hey You: ?Ask your Mummy.?<br>In the pre-teen years, little boys will fill hours naming great sporting teams. They will be able to rattle off the 1992 and 1994 Eagles premiership sides or the entire 1993 Ashes-winning cricket team. If they're really good, they will blurt out the victorious French World Cup soccer team, including reserves and coach.<br>Not having been a pre-teen little girl, I am not sure what they name. But I suspect some of them come up with lists of potential husbands and children.<br>By the late teens and early twenties, many have trouble with this name game. Such is the pace of life they have trouble even naming the day of the week after the normal round of parties and pubs.<br>This trend tapers off by the late twenties, early thirties when many have made interesting use of their misspent years and taken a partner with whom they have produced offspring.<br>And these kiddies have to be named, of course. Will it be David or Elizabeth; Simon or Julia; Kane or Brittany?<br>It all takes huge slices of time. And just when we thought we had done our bit, produced children to start the never-ending cycle of naming, another bout lies in waiting.<br>It comes in the early forties when the wise old saying suggests that real life starts . . . yeah, sure. That name game is for the type of dog your family invariably want to complement their life.<br>SURPRISING amounts of time can be spent in naming the sort of dog you want. A seemingly well-matched couple with lots in common can suddenly find he is a border collie person, and she is a little bitch . . . in terms of canine preferences.<br>What makes it harder is cross-breeding. For example, you now have to deal with these new names.<br>Collapso: cross between collie and lhasa apso - a dog that folds up for easy transport.<br>Spitz-Chow: a spitz and chow chow cross - throws up a lot.<br>Bloody Bore: what happens when a bloodhound and borzoi mate, producing a dog that's not much fun.<br>Blue Skye: the result of mating a kerry blue terrier with a skye terrier. It is a dog for visionaries.<br>Peekasso: take the product of a union between a pekingese and a lhasa apso, and you get an abstract dog.<br>Lab Coat Retriever: the universal choice of research scientists and is the result of putting a labrador retriever and a curly-coated retriever together.<br>Newfound Asset Hound: cross a newfoundland with a basset hound and you have a dog for financial advisers.<br>Terribull: unfortunately the mating of a terrier and a bulldog produces offspring that make awful mistakes.<br>Blabador: this bloodhound-labrador cross barks incessantly.<br>Commute: very handy breed because it can travel to work. It is the result of crossing a collie with a malamute.<br>And if you cross a bull terrier with a shitzu, we all know the result is a . . . terrierzu.<br>Bet you thought I was going to say something else.<br>I'm too well bred for that.<br></font></p>
