            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">You go away for two weeks and the whole world goes feral. For example:n Microsoft kowtows - for the time-being - to the US Department of Justice and agrees to abide by the 1995 ruling that it not force PC manufacturers to include the Internet Explorer browser as an integral part of Windows 95.Netscape, reeling under $140 million losses for the last quarter of 1997, decides to give its Communicator Web package away for free and to make Navigator source code free to software developers.n Online journalist Matt Drudge scoops the known world with the latest Smoking Trousers affair of President Bill Clinton. His Drudge Report receives more than a million hits in a week. Mr Clinton's popularity increases. Iraq trembles.Transperth uses the so-called superhighway to tell people where and how they can catch public transport around Perth's not-quite-as-superhighways. The online journey planner is fun - when accessible.You can find out five different ways to get 1km from one side of Stirling Highway to the other, for example. It is an Australian first and far better than similar planners in Britain that enable you to find which tube trains will arrive too late to get you from The Strand to Heathrow in time for your flight.n Talk-show host Howard Sattler goes online with a neat site that enables Netizens to vote in his opinion polls. He also has a humble way of introducing himself with the headline ?Talk-Back King Goes Global?.After all he is, according to the Web site spiel that follows, ?? well-known across the State as an aggressive talk-back presenter with very strong opinions, a man who is not afraid to say exactly what he thinks and will do so?.The immediate question begged is what sort of reception awaits him in cyberspace, a medium inhabited by a younger, potentially bigger and more educated audience than Sattler has on radio.n The Melbourne Age's live Australian Open tennis site proves very good at enabling people to follow game-by-game scores ? in singles. But on the day that the Woodies fail to win another doubles crown, their scores are strangely absent.The site also follows the maddening Internet maxim of giving surfers lots of choices when they want to know only one thing. When you click for live coverage, you are presented with a page that asks you to select a tournament. The choices are: 1998 Australian Open ? and nothing but clear white space.At the same tournament, the battalion of Channel 7 commentators, when not grovelling to John McEnroe, gives out the network's Web address to fans wanting more coverage. When they get there they find lots of promotional material about Seven programs and just a teensy bit of tennis.n Russia's teen queen Anna Kournikova appears to set a record for the number of Web sites in her honour. A Sydney journalist claims there are 5000, including the tawdry Upskirts Anna which features nothing but pictures of the precocious super-brat bending over to pick up tennis balls. Professional investigation of the site - purely for work purposes - reveals that one must register and pay to see more than a couple of these images.n The truth about the Net is revealed in an e-mail message. My correspondent does not know who wrote the words because he got it from someone who got it from someone else, etc, in the true spirit of mass interaction.Somewhere along the way, the authorship fell off, although the following words sound as if they could be from American humourist Dave Barry. Here's what they said:<br>Q. What, exactly, is the Internet?<br>A. The Internet is a worldwide network of university, government, business, and private computer systems.<br>Q. Who runs it?<br>A. A 13-year-old named Jason.<br>Q. What are the benefits of online services? A. The major benefit is that they all have simple,"user-friendly? interfaces that enable you - even if you have no previous computer experience - to provide the online services with the information they need to automatically put monthly charges on your credit card bill forever.And there we have it. Life on the Web just keeps rolling along.<br></font></p>
