            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE JACKAL H H<br>For years Carlos the Jackal was the epitome of the international terrorist, a dark, sexy figure who moved through the world like a shadow and offered his services to a variety of revolutionary causes. Last year Carlos was captured and tried in Paris and turned to be, of all things, a crushingly long-winded bore who drove judge and jury completely nuts. Bruce Willis plays the Carlos-like terrorist in this remake of Fred Zinnemann's 1973 classic thriller, The Day of the Jackal (based on Frederick Forsyth's best-seller) and while he doesn't have much to say he's equally tedious and ridiculous. Changing his disguise more often than a supermodel in a Paris fashion show, with each new hairstyle drawing not less but more attention to himself, Willis' Jackal seems to go to absurd lengths to do the simplest things, such as crossing the American-Canadian border, in the most conspicuous, absurdly theatrical manner possible. Jackal, he's not - more a jackass in a bad wig. Richard Gere brings dignity to proceedings as an imprisoned former IRA soldier who agrees to track the Jackal in exchange for leniency. Naturally, he does a wonderful job, but then again Willis' terrorist leaves more clues than Hansel - only his bread crumbs are bloodied corpses. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE END OF VIOLENCE H H H ½<br>After several years drifting in the artistic wilderness, like one of his existential wanderer heroes, Wim Wenders returns with his strongest film since Wings of Desire. Working in wide-screen and colour - The End of Violence is one of the most strikingly beautiful movies I've seen in some time - Wenders operates from the notion that the violent images perpetrated by Hollywood are a plot to induce fear and paranoia, thus justifying increased police surveillance and brutality. This idea emerges, in typically slow and oblique Wenders fashion, from two stories which eventually intersect in the bloody climax - one involving the slick producer of violent action movies (Bill Pullman), who himself becomes the victim of a violent crime, the other about a surveillance expert (Gabriel Byrne) at work on a secret government project to track crime with a network of hidden cameras. All this is put together with the great confidence and artistic precision we expect of this great German director. The big problem is that The End of Violence is a product of the paranoia that the film is supposedly addressing - a series of ideas yanked together to jolt rather than an intellectually convincing and emotionally persuasive drama. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>TROMEO & JULIET H H H<br>?Parting is such sweet sorrow,? coos Juliet. ?Totally sucks,? agrees Tromeo. Hollywood B-movie moguls The Troma Team pitch their reading of Shakespeare's great romance way over the top in a splatter-fest of Gen-X attitude, colourful bodily functions, comical mega-violence and graphic sexual perversions. Fans of Russ Meyer, Peter Jackson and early John Waters will squirm with glee as this cheap and very nasty adaptation pours on the pierced and tattooed street grit with epic schlock values. Troma's James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufmann take liberties with Shakey's story to invoke gut-wrenching sympathy for our heroes - Juliet (rock chick Jane Jensen) is the victim of incest, bondage and lesbian exploitation for starters - and to explain the enmity between ?Cappy? Capulet and Monty Que (it's a porn industry takeover thing). Plenty of Shakespeare's tenderness and didactic intent remain, but never at the expense of a stomach-churning sight gag. With close-up nipple piercing, death by tampon and clueless iambic pentameter by Lemmy from Motorhead, neither the squeamish nor staunchly literary need apply. Starts tomorrow at the Luna. Rated R (Michael Dwyer).<br>SPICEWORLD THE MOVIE H H H ½<br>Love them or loathe them, there's no escaping English singing quintet the Spice Girls this summer. And even if you have doubts about their ability to perform live, as I do, you'll be refreshingly surprised about their capacity to entertain on the big screen. Spiceworld is essentially a movie about a movie with Posh, Baby, Sporty, Scary and Ginger playing themselves as they drive from autograph-signing session to public appearance to rehearsal and so on. The girls have a big gig ahead of them but first they have to survive run-ins with wobbly platform heels, each other and a sneaky photographer working for a newspaper chief (Barry Humphries) who wants to publish exclusive news of their demise. It's all completely over the top, of course, made even more so by the exaggerated performance of Richard E. Grant as their lurex-clad manager, Clifford, and the even more obscure appearances of Roger Moore as the mysterious ?chief? in charge of the Spice career trajectory. Add cameos from the likes of Jennifer Saunders, Meatloaf and Sir Bob Geldof and you have 90 minutes of family fun. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>LIBERTARIAS H H H H<br>The tragic story of the Spanish Civil War is often told through the eyes of idealistic outsiders, such as those who fought in the International Brigade (as in Ken Loach's Land and Freedom). At last Spaniards themselves step into the frontline in this stirring, bloody melodrama about a conflict that came to be seen as a dress rehearsal for World War II. Even better, veteran director Vincente Aranda has focused on the Free Women's Organisation, a group of feisty anarchists intent on serving alongside their men folk in the battle against Franco's fascist forces. Made up of hardcore revolutionaries, recently liberated prostitutes and a quivering nun (a lovely, fragile performance from Ariadna Gil), the women act out their personal liberation through the barrel of a gun, genuine GI Jane whose essential femininity comes to embody the spirit of this ?last romantic war?. Those with knowledge of 1930s Spanish history and politics will get the full meaning of their struggle. The rest will simply relish this moving, beautifully filmed and passionately acted war epic. Libertarias screens at the Somerville Auditorium from Monday. Rated R (Mark Naglazas)<br>MARQUISE H H ½<br>This true-life tale about a brash, ambitious actress named Marquise (Sophie Marceau) who is torn between the great 17th century playwrights Moliere and Racine, the comedian and the tragedian, is rich pickings indeed. Unfortunately, veteran director Vera Belmont seems more intent on playing up the bawdy stuff than exploring the interesting Moliere/Racine dichotomy. It's a series of lively moments and scenes rather than an intellectually and emotionally satisfying whole. Screening at the Somerville Auditorium until Sunday. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>ALIEN RESURRECTION H H H<br>Madcap Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children) has breathed new life into the seemingly doomed Alien franchise with imagination, daring and stunning surrealist visuals. Connoisseurs of the cycle won't be flooding the Net with fan mail over this spoofy laugh-a-minute new version that doesn't take itself seriously. If they don't care about the fate of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, why should we? Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>MADAME BUTTERFLY H H H H<br>While there is not much visual excitment in this version of Puccini's beloved opera, director Frederic Mitterand has a crisp, subtle style which suits this sad tale of a 15-year-old Japanese girl who is tricked into marrying an American naval officer, the notorious Pinkerton, and abandoned with a child. The musical level is perhaps not what you would expect to find in great opera houses but this French production captures the essence of an opera that still has the power to move and enrage. At the Encore Cinemas in the Entertainment Centre. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>MOUSEHUNT H H H ½<br>Closer in anarchic spirit to the violent, politically incorrect Warner Brothers cartoons or Tom and Jerry than anything from the studio symbolised by that other mouse - the one with the impeccable morals - this slapstick story of a resilient rodent who wages an epic Home Alone-style battle with intruders will amuse parents and children alike. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>FLUBBER H H ½<br>The ability to do neat things with computer graphics and other digital tomfoolery appears to be the only explanation for Disney remaking its pleasant but unremarkable 1961 movie The Absent Minded Professor. It's also a waste of the talents of Robin Williams, whose eccentric Professor Brainard invents an oozing green, frictionless, energetic compound called flubber (or flying rubber). It's too cute for all but the youngest or most easily amused. Rated G (David Watts)<br>HER MAJESTY MRS BROWN H H H H<br>The idea of a flesh-and-blood Queen Victoria who could enjoy the company of her straight-talking Scottish servant more than that of the flunkeys who surrounded her might come as a bit of a shock to some. But Judi Dench is superb as the old dame, giving her some unexpected humanity, while Billy Connolly does a fine job as the servant with attitude. Is there more to it? The film remains undecided about their relationship but offers an intriguing and often amusing look at Victoria's life and times. Rated PG (Chris McLeod)<br>I WENT DOWN H H H<br>Paddy Breathnach has avoided the Irish stereotypes in his taut, darkly comic road, buddy, gangster movie about a sweet-natured ex-con (Peter McDonald) and a shambling, inarticulate hood (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered by a crime boss to kidnap an indebted associate. Sure, it's another post-Tarantino gangster farce but I Went Down has a peculiarly Irish energy and invention. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>FAIRYTALE: A TRUE STORY H H H<br>It's hard to know at which audience this ?true-life? tale about two English girls who supposedly photographed fairies in their backyard in 1917 is aimed. A sophisticated analysis of our need for faith in times of crises is countered by flitting, dancing fairies that will delight children but make adults guffaw. It's pretty, sweetly acted and the winged creatures are cute, but the film-makers seem to have snorted a little too much fairy dust. Rated G (Mark Naglazas)<br></font></p>
