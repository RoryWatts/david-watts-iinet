            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Swimming<br>SWIMMING has been around as long as humans have lived near water. In Australia ?girt by sea? as Advance Australia Fair puts it it is one of our most popular sports and one in which we are often world beaters.<br>Swimmers from Andrew ?Boy? Charlton and Fanny Durack in the early part of the century, through to the golden era of Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and the Konrads, and to now with Kieren Perkins, Susie O'Neill and Samantha Riley, are household names.<br>Swimming is often mentioned in Greek mythology and the Old Testament.<br>Mosaics from early Middle Eastern civilizations depict men swimming with the dog stroke, as do mosaics at Pompeii. Although swimming was not included in the ancient Olympic Games, the Greeks practised the sport.<br>The philosopher Plato considered a man who didn't know how to swim uneducated.<br>Both Julius Caesar and Charlemagne were known as great swimmers, and Louis XI frequently took swims in the Seine.<br>Modern competitive swimming did not begin until the early 19th century when the National Swimming Society of Great Britain began holding competitions.<br>Europeans were devoted practioners of the sedate breastroke and sidestroke techniques, and more concerned with endurance than speed.<br>At a competition in 1844, two American Indians, Flying Gull and Tobacco, shocked the British swimming establishment when they produced sizzling times with a frenetic thrashing style that was said to resemble a windmill.<br>But their basic stroke had been observed among indingenous people elsewhere. In the late 19th century in Australia, English immigrant Frederick Cavill and Henry Wickham, refined the windmill ?crawl? with kicking, rather than frog-style movements or up-and-down beating, of the legs. This faster crawl became known as freestyle.<br>Freestyle and breastroke made their Olympic debut at the first modern games in Athens in 1896. The backstroke was added in 1904, and women began competing in 1912. In the 1940s, the butterfly evolved as a way of circumventing breaststroke rules and was added as its own event in 1956.<br>Sources of statistics and information:<br>http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/sports/aquatics/d-SW-2.html (Official 1996 Olympic Web Site, Spectator's Guide to Swimming)<br>http://netspace.net.au/~logan/record.html (Australian, Commonwealth and World Records)<br>http://www.ausport.gov.au/swisp.html (Australian Institute of Sport swim page)<br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/olympics/longterm/sw (Washington Post, history of swimming)<br>Gold, gold, gold<br>AUSTRALIAN swimmers have featured strongly among the nation's Olympic gold medallists.<br>Gold, still considered the sport's ultimate prize, has been won by:<br>Paris 1900<br>Freddy Lane, 200m freestyle and 200m obstacle race.<br>Stockholm 1912<br>Fanny Durack, 100m freestyle.<br>Men's 4x200m freestyle relay.<br>Paris 1924<br>Richard Eve, tower dive.<br>Andrew Charlton, 1500m freestyle.<br>Los Angeles 1932<br>Clare Dennis, 200m breastroke.<br>Helsinki 1952<br>John Davies, 200m breastroke.<br>Melbourne 1956<br>Jon Henricks, 100m freestyle.<br>Murray Rose, 400m and 1500m freestyle.<br>David Theile, 100m backstroke.<br>Men's 4x200m freestyle relay.<br>Dawn Fraser, 100m freestyle.<br>Lorraine Crapp, 400m freestyle.<br>Women's 4x100m freestyle relay.<br>Rome 1960<br>John Devitt, 100m freestyle.<br>Murray Rose, 400m freestyle.<br>John Konrads, 1500m freestyle.<br>David Theile, 100m backstroke.<br>Dawn Fraser, 100m freestyle.<br>Tokyo 1964<br>Robert Windle, 1500m freestyle.<br>Kevin Berry, 200m butterfly.<br>Ian O'Brien, 200m breastroke.<br>Dawn Fraser, 100m freestyle.<br>Mexico 1968<br>Michael Wenden, 100 and 200m freestyle.<br>Lyn McClements, 100m butterfly.<br>Munich 1972<br>Shane Gould, 200, 400m freestyle, 200m ind. medley.<br>Gail Neall, 400m ind. medley.<br>Beverley Whitfield, 200m breastroke.<br>Brad Cooper, 400m freestyle.<br>Moscow 1980<br>Men's 4x100m medley relay.<br>Michelle Ford, 800m freestyle.<br>Los Angeles 1984<br>Jon Sieben, 200m butterfly.<br>Seoul 1988<br>Duncan Armstrong, 200m freestyle.<br>Barcelona 1992<br>Kieren Perkins, 1500m freestyle.<br>Atlanta 1996<br>Kieren Perkins, 1500m freestyle.<br>Susie O'Neill, 200m butterfly(?).<br>Times change<br>THESE chronologies of Olympic records in certain events show how swimmers have become steadily faster.<br>(Times are not always from the final)<br>MEN<br>100m freestyle:<br>1896 - 1:22.2 Alfred Hajos (Hungary)<br>1912 - 1:02.6 Duke Kahanamoku (US)<br>1924 - 59.0 Johnny Weissmuller (US)<br>1956 - 55.4 Jon Henricks (Aus)<br>1968 - 52.2 Michael Wenden (Aus)<br>1976 - 49.99 Jim Montgomery (US)<br>200m:<br>1900 - 2:35.6 Otto Wahle (Austria - swum in the River Seine, Paris)<br>1952 - 2:07.0 Hirsohi Suzuku (Japan)<br>1964 - 2:00.0 Steve Clark (US)<br>1972 - 1:52.78 Mark Spitz (US)<br>1980 - 1:49.81 Sergei Kopliakov (USSR)<br>1992 - 1:46.70 Evgeni Sadovyi (Unified States)<br>400m:<br>1904 - 6:16.2 Charles Daniels (US)<br>1912 - 5:24.4 George Hodgson (Canada)<br>1932 - 4:53.2 Takashi Yokoyama (Japan)<br>1956 - 4:27.3 Murray Rose (Aus)<br>1968 - 4:09.0 Mike Burton (US)<br>1992 - 3:45.00 Evgeni Sadoviy (Unified)<br>1500m:<br>1908 - 23:45.8 Frank Beaurepaire (Aus)<br>1924 - 20:06.6 Andrew Charlton (Aus)<br>1956 - 18:04.1 Murray Rose (Aus)<br>1964 - 17:01.7 Robert Windle (Aus)<br>1968 - 16:38.9 Michael Burton (US)<br>1976 - 15:02.40 Brian Goodell (US)<br>1992 - 14:43.48 Kieren Perkins (Aus)<br>Women<br>100m freestyle:<br>1912 - 1:29.8 Isabella Moore (UK)<br>1920 - 1:13.6 Ethelda Bleibtrey (US)<br>1932 - 1:06.8 Helene Madison (US)<br>1956 - 1:02.0 Dawn Fraser (Aus)<br>1960 - 59.5 Dawn Fraser (Aus)<br>1976 - 55.65 Kornelia Ender (EG)<br>200m:<br>1968 - 2:13.1 Debbie Meyer (US)<br>1972 - 2:03.56 Shane Gould (Aus)<br>1988 - 1:57.65 Heike Friedrich (EG)<br>400m:<br>1924 - 6:12.2 Gertrude Ederle (US)<br>1932 - 5:28.5 Helene Madison (US)<br>1956 - 4:54.6 Lorraine Crapp (Aus)<br>1968 - 4:31.8 Debbie Meyer (US)<br>1976 - 4:09.89 Petra Thumer (EG)<br>1988 - 4:03.85 Janet Evans (US)<br>Kieren Perkins<br>THE most famous swimmer in Australia is Queenslander Kieren Perkins, holder of three world records.

Here are a few terms.<br>Drag suit: A second loose fitting swim suit worn by swimmers in workout and warm-up to add a certain amount of weight and resistance to the flow of the water. The concept is similar to a batter swinging two or three bats while on deck in a baseball game or a runner training by dragging a weight.<br>FINA: Federation Internationale de National de Amateur, the international governing body of competitive swimming, diving, water polo and synchronised swimming.<br>Gravity wave: Wave action caused by the swimmers' bodies moving through the water. Gravity waves move down and forward from the swimmer, bounce off the bottom of the pool and return to the surface in the form of turbulence.<br>Gutter: The area at the edges of the pool in which water overflows during a race and is recirculated into the pool.<br>Negative split: A race strategy in the distance freestyle events in which a swimmer covers the second half of the race faster than the first half.<br>Roll: To move on the starting blocks before the starting signal.<br>Skinsuit: Slang for a swimsuit designed to have minimum drag in the water. While many swimmers use knitted lycra, the newest suit is woven lycra, called a "paper' suit because of its texture.<br>Split: Intermediate time in a race, registered every 50m and used to determine if a swimmer is on record pace.<br>Taper: The resting process in training for swimming competition.<br>Warm down: Used by the swimmer to rid the body of excess lactic acid generated during a race.<br>Warm-up: Used by the swimmer before the race to get their muscles loose and ready.<br>Poolside Quotes<br>One day my brother threw me in to the water at Ives' Baths and I had to get out the best way I could. I dog-paddled out - Freddie Lane, Australia's first swimming gold medalist when he won the 200 metres freestyle, swum in the River Seine.<br>As he raised his hands above his head on the blocks he looked about nine feet tall - Jon Seiben, then 17, on his 200 metres butterfly rival Michael Gross before the 1984 Olympic final. Seiben won in world record time.<br>I came to loath it - Shane Gould on the fame brought to her by three gold medals in one week at the 1972 Olympic Games.<br>I still can't match the severity of the sentence with anything I did - Dawn Fraser on her 10 year suspension for helping steal a flag at the 1994 Tokyo Olympics.<br></font></p>
