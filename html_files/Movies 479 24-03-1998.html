            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>www.screenit.com<br>You can't watch over your children every second of the day but this site packed with ?entertainment reviews for parents"will help take the guess work out of what makes for suitable viewing and listening. Although the US rating system is a little diffrent to ours, Screen It's films are rated by 15 different categories including amounts of sex, drugs and violence. A brief plot is followed by a full review and points that may need further discussion by parents. Once in the film section you can search by rating, genre or older release. The latter is where you will find most films now on Perth screens, such as As Good As It Gets, The Boxer and Titanic. You can also search in new releases and videos. The music archive is nowhere near as comprehensive as the films but it does have recent releases from the likes of Bryan Adams and U2. Esteemed Chiago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert describes this as one of the five most useful movie sites online. Check it out for yourself. (SY)<br>Too-hard rock<br>MUSIC<br>www.rock.com<br>This site is an example of design taken right to the edge, and over it. Rock.com is the brainchild of Thinking Pictures, a spinoff of the respected MIT Medialab. Thinking Pictures has developed the software and network architecture for live Web broadcasts for the likes of The Rolling Stones, Tori Amos and Jewel. Thinking Pictures and Rock.com staff members have also been responsible for the design and production of a wide range of technology/content projects for the film and recording industries. Rock.com is supposedly designed to provide record labels with an ?affordable and effective means of promoting artists and distributing products online?. But what greets the visitor is a barrage of conflicting colours and typefaces that makes finding any of the sections (games, videos, music, concerts, message boards) very hard on the eyes. Some areas need special plug-ins and one section caused my browser to crash. Let's hope this radical style doesn't catch on. (SY)<br>Motor Neurone Disease<br>HEALTH<br>perth.dialix.oz.au/ ~mndawa/mndatop.html<br>March 28 marks the start of Motor Neurone Disease's national awareness week and reader Steve Brown thought it would be a good time to draw attention to the MND Association of Western Australia's Web site, thought to be the first MND-dedicated site in Australia. The text-based site lists the objectives and history of the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Western Australia, which is a registered charity and support organisation that aims to improve the quality of life for people living with MND. The site provides contact details, links to other resources, coming events and facts about MND such as what it is, symptoms, and how is it diagnosed. An FAQ is under construction. (SY)<br>Private Eye magazine<br>MEDIA<br>privateeye.uk.msn.com<br>You have to have a few things before exploring the site of the famous British satirical magazine. One is a fast connection, another is Macromedia plug-ins like Flash and Shockwave. Yet another is lots of patience. Although Private Eye in the real world is printed on cheap paper, the Web version uses the latest high-technology gimmickry. This could be explained by its marriage to an unlikely suitor, the Microsoft Network. Thus the offspring has all the funny and outrageous genes of the magazine, and all the slow-moving but impressive pyrotechnics of MSN. If it plays on your screen, it is a treat. Lord Gnome's ramblings on the Millennium Bug are worth the visit alone. But there is a lot more including political gossip and the very funny faux pas made by sporting commentators. (DW)<br>G7 Summit Information<br>WORLD POLITICS<br>www.g7.com<br>Actually the G7 is really the G8. Someone appears to have forgotten to tell this official site of the world's leading industrialised nations. Russia, for several years a guest at the annual summits of the world leaders, is an official participant at this year's conflab in Denver, Colorado, in June. Its place at the table is recognised on the main page with a Russian flag alongside those of the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain. Click on one of these flags and you are rewarded with an excellent summary of facts and figures about the country. The site is also packed with information about G7 summits and offers a quiz to find out how much we know about the cultures of these leading nations. (DW).<br>The Bill<br>TELEVISION<br>www.thebill.com<br>This is the official site for the TV program, often hailed as the best police show on TV. The Bill has been gracing our screens for 15 years and is constantly a big rater in Australia, New Zealand and its homeland, Britain. The site offers story lines of weekly episodes, a guide to buying video releases of past classics, some featuring Sun Hill favourites DS Roach and DI Burnside; plus lots of the essential trivia that true fans thrive on. (DW).<br>Web Sights and selections of Help Desks and columns are available on the Web at: www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/access/access.html<br>If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.au All sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br></font></p>
