            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FOOTY is no joke. It is a hard game where normal citizens revert to tribal behaviour and where even the most level-headed become rabid.<br>The casual television viewer would not think the game was serious at all, however. The swag of footy talk shows and panels are becoming mini-circuses.<br>This is not to say there is no fun in footy. But on Sunday mornings, especially, men who should know better try to be comedians.<br>Take Channel 7's Footy Panel last Sunday for example. It appeared to be a forum where every panellist was having a go at former Collingwood great Peter McKenna for missing out on the Magpies' team of the century.<br>Discussion of games deteriorated while everyone pursued his own jokey agenda.<br>Limping West Coast frontman Chris Mainwaring and star Magpie Nathan Buckley tried in vain to make some sense about the titanic Eagles win at Victoria Park.<br>The chairman of the blokey board, so to speak, is Rex Hunt, an acquired taste, who likes to run things in his own language. Thus Collingwood is always Carringbush. It becomes tiring.<br>The match reports themselves can be a bit of a joke, too. I don't like to get into us-versus-Melbourne type dis- cussions because it usually cuts both ways. But only a Victorian - in this case Ian Robertson - could have picked Buckley and Paul Williams as two of the three vote-getters in the best players at Victoria Park on Saturday. The other was West Coast's Peter Matera.<br>The Magpies lost for goodness sake. Williams and Buckley gathered dozens of possessions, but blind Freddy could see that John Worsfold had a far greater impact on the game than either of them.<br>But all this paled into insignificance compared with Nine's Sunday Footy Show in the same timeslot.<br>Here, host Max Walker just let his ?characters? get out of control. Dermott Brereton, Mark Jackson, Brian Taylor and Mal Brown were acting like little boys, throwing water or juice over each other, bursting into uncontrollable laughter and failing to make any sense.<br>Both shows should leave the comedy to Nine's Thursday night Footy Show. Sam Newman, Trevor Marmalade and Eddie Maguire appear to have perfected the art of finding humour in footy while, at the same time, giving the audience a bit of real information about the game.<br></font></p>
