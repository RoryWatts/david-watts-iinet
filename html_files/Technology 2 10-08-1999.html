            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO major search engines - stung by a critical report last month - have launched plans to index the whole World Wide Web.<br>US company Excite@Home and Norway's FAST both said last week they aimed to extend their engines' reach to all estimated 800 million Web pages.<br>And they said they would keep up with the phenomenal growth of the medium.<br>Last month, US researchers Steve Lawrence and Lee Giles published a report in the science journal Nature that found no engine of 11 tested logged more than about 124 million Web pages.<br>Excite@Home's Excite engine covered only 5.6 per cent and FAST was not rated important enough for the two Princeton doctors to test.<br>FAST was the first company out of the blocks with its response. Early last week it said its ultimate goal was to allow users to search the whole Web. ?As the Web continues to experience explosive growth, most users mistakenly assume they are searching the entire Internet during a search engine query - FAST Search will be the first search engine to actually make this a reality,? said Espen Brodin, the company's president.<br>FAST claims its engine covers 200 million pages now, significantly more than any engine tested by Dr Lawrence and Dr Giles. Their best performer was Snap with 15.5 per cent, or 124 million pages.<br>Excite, with 50 million pages, announced plans to extend coverage only a day after FAST. The company expects to start its expansion next month with an initial aim of 300 million pages within months.<br>FAST's stated first milestone is to get to 550 million pages. US chief executive David Burns told the Search Engine Watch Web site last week that it was not possible to estimate when that goal would be reached. ?It's not measured in multiple years,? he said. But he promised that FAST had thrown down the gauntlet in one of the Web's most important areas - one described by the Los Angeles Times as the holy grail of the medium, the ability to access all online information.<br>However, critics have attacked both companies' plans as a waste of resources that will mean little to the average user. They have also been labelled as counter-productive by vastly expanding the number of irrelevant results on a search request. ?What does it mean to have another 100,000 or 200,000 links show up in a search?? said Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group, a Web usability consulting firm. ?It is 100 per cent irrelevant,? he told the LA Times.<br>Search engines already tended to overload users with hundreds, if not thousands or tens of thousands of useless sites. ?The only thing that matters is the top 10 links you get back,? Mr Nielsen said. ?Maybe you click on the next page of results, but that's rare.?<br>The problem with automated engines was not their reach, but an inability to distinguish what was relevant, important or worthwhile.<br>Mr Nielsen said search engines already had gone through a ?bigger-is-better? phase, until the sheer size of the Web started to become unwieldy.<br>A spokesman for leading engine, Inktomi, agreed that indexing much more of the Web would produce huge databases with hundreds of millions of obscure pages that would dilute the useful information.<br>Inktomi says that relevance of search results comes first, then size. Its index has been stable at 110 million pages for over a year.<br>But Search Engine Watch editor Danny Sullivan believes the idea that bigger is better is back with a vengeance.<br>He said that FAST's announcement set a new benchmark in search engine size and coverage.<br>The desirability of a huge search index is even taxing one of the companies with big plans.<br>Kris Carpenter, a director of Excite, told the LA Times she believed that most consumers still did not want all 800 million pages.<br>Help Desk<br>FAST: www.alltheweb.<br>com<br>Excite: www.excite.com<br>Search Engine Watch:<br>www.searchengine<br>watch.com<br></font></p>
