            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Netscape had its new Communicator browser suite on the drawing board of the Net for six months before releasing it officially last month. It was well worth the wait.<br>The handsome product, which beat Microsoft to the punch, is the first official fourth-generation Web browser. MS's new Internet Explorer is still at an early stage with too many bugs for the average user.<br>Communicator is much more than a browser. It packs in a much improved e-mail service called Messenger, a slightly unwieldy news and mail centre called Collabra, a smart HTML editor known as Composer and the Conference chat facility.<br>The once-familiar Navigator browser is the centrepiece of the suite that comes in two versions, Standard (about 7.5Mb) and Professional (13Mb).<br>The first impression of the new Navigator is just how good the interface looks. Netscape packaged the first three generations of its browser in, basically, the same old clothes. They were familiar but became slightly daggy once Microsoft got its act together with Explorer.<br>Appearance counts for very little, however. It is the way that appearance functions that dictates the worth of Navigator.<br>A right-click on the back/forward arrows now shows what sites have been visited (not with sometimes-confusing URLs, but with the actual titles of the sites).<br>The location icon next to the URL box can be dragged directly into any bookmark folder and also straight to Composer to create a link on a page in progress.<br>This handy function cuts down the clicking and opening of windows once needed to create bookmarks.<br>In fact, big bookmark files may no longer be needed because Navigator also enables users to drag the location icon straight on to the new personal toolbar, where a link is created.<br>With favourite sites on this toolbar, there is no need to search bookmarks or type in addresses.<br>Netscape has also reorganised its preferences or options menu, although it is not as readily accessible as it used to be. Rather than a menu organised by tabs, preferences are now in a tree-like directory structure. Whether it is any better is moot.<br>Communicator went through five pre-release or beta stages, all available on the Web, before making the big jump. At each stage it has improved both appearance and functionality so that this official release actually does what Netscape hoped it would make nearly every other Net program irrelevant.<br>It is smooth and, after hours of rigorous surfing, appears to be stable. All the beta versions crashed regularly but not this final release.<br>Unless, of course, a user installs the beta release of Netcaster, the push technology Netscape had been hoping would be released with Communicator.<br>Netcaster just won't cut it on my machine. It looks good and promises much, but send it out to fetch a Web site for the hard drive and down it goes, taking the entire Communicator program with it.<br>Apart from that, the new Netscape is a good product, a worthy successor to the earlier revolutionary browsers.<br>The fact that it pulls nearly all Net-related chores into one easily manipulated package makes it a winner.<br>HELP DESK<br>Web browser: A program that enables the surfer to view documents on the Web. These are mostly written in HyperText Mark-up Language or HTML.<br>Bookmark: Pointer to a Web site added to a special folder (called Favourites in Microsoft Explorer) for easy future access.<br>Beta: Test software at an advanced stage, but not ready for official release. Beta programs are let loose on average users to determine what faults need to be fixed, or what improvements need to be made.<br>Push technology: Programs that load special sites on to your hard drive and which can be configured to hunt for and update pages.<br>Netscape: www.netscape.com.au<br>Browser tips: www.browser.com<br></font></p>
