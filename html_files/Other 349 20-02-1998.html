            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAD to come. And it's not surprising. Last week I listed some damn good reasons for being a bloke. Among them: it takes 10 minutes to shower and get ready; phone calls take 30 seconds, and three pairs of shoes are enough.<br>Those were published on Friday the 13th, and the next day was Valentine's Day for all you little Pookies and Honeybottoms out there.It was an irresistible combination of dates and led at least one - well, so far only one - reader of this column to retaliate.<br>Kathleen Donoghue wrote a neat little letter, dated Valentine's Day, and packed it off in a neat little envelope so that my heart skipped a beat or two when I spotted it in the pigeonhole. Could this be a Valentine? Someone loves me. A secret admirer. Swoon, etc.<br>But no, it was better than that. Kathleen had drawn up a list of the 10 best things about being a girl.I had done 15 for blokes, but she insists women are far better and far more economical with lists.<br>Let's wade in. This list, by the way, has been looked at and approved by a quorum of GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums):<br>1: Women are allowed to cry when the need arises.<br>2: They can yell, scream and behave like a child and get away with it at least once a month by blaming it on PMT.<br>3: They look better in the nude (or fully dressed for that matter).<br>4: They can borrow men's clothes and still look good - seen a bloke look good in a dress?<br>5: Most women manage to still smell good even after a day at work.<br>6: They know what men want while men are still trying to figure out what women want. (What could she mean? - DW).<br>7: They don't have to kill their own food - men usually do it for them.<br>8: They could buy three pieces of underwear for $10, like blokes, but would blokes rather they had three pairs of Cottontails or one lacy G-string?<br>9: A bloke's bottom is never a factor in job interviews but the right bottom and bits can get a woman more than a job . . . if so inclined.<br>10: Women never have to be lonely. They can call their girlfriends for any reason any time of the day or night.<br>I tried to contact a few blokes to check the veracity of this last one, but the line was being used by my wife to organise coffee and a chat with one of her GYM friends.She was having a coffee and a long chat at the time, so I wondered why she would bother organising one of each. But see Kathleen's point 6.<br>Her list coincided with another I saw the same day, just to confirm the spooky convergence of Friday the 13th and Valentine's Day and its ability to make GYMs retaliate.<br>This list came in the form of advice to women. Some of the points made:<br>* You know he's lying if his lips are moving;<br>* Remember you are known by the idiot you accompany;<br>* Don't imagine you can change a man - unless he's in nappies;<br>* If they can put a man on the moon, they should be able to put them all there;<br>* Go for younger men. You might as well. They never mature anyway;<br>* The best way to get a man to do something is to suggest they are too old for it;<br>* If you want a committed man, look in a mental hospital.<br>And finally, the unkindest cut of all:<br>* There are a lot of words you can use to describe men - strong, caring, loving. They'd be wrong, but you could still use them.<br>BEFORE we go, did you realise that if Woody Allen married Natalie Wood, divorced her and married Gregory Peck, divorced him and married Ben Hur, he'd be Woody Wood Peck Hur?<br></font></p>
