            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FEMALE friend, whose name I cannot divulge for fear of reprisal, swears the following tale of revenge is true. It concerns her dad and a crow.<br>And to get the now-mandatory football reference in early - it was not an Adelaide Crow. Far too mean and tough for that.<br>It was your normal black, swearing, thieving, lumbering, car-defying crow with the average quotient of two beady yellow eyes.<br>This crow was not liked by my friend's father. He was a farmer at Three Springs and the crow stole things about the place and messed with his crops. More important he just did not like it. It was too, well, crowlike.<br>So one day he left out a couple of sticks of dynamite - normally used for shifting big tree roots - right in the yard where the crow liked to peck and ... er, crow.<br>Crows are curious. This one was no different and he swooped on the explosives happily. The farmer found a bucket of glee and rubbed his hands with it.<br>Then the crow's lazy flying pattern changed. Instead of heading for the bush, he did a 90-degree turn and swept into the shed ... full of seeds, new tractor and freshly-mown hay.<br>Bang. End of crow, tractor, hay, seeds and shed. If he could have, and maybe he did, the crow laughed last.<br>Which all goes to show you cannot underestimate animals, no matter their species.<br>In England the dog has long been king. Dogs are allowed on public transport, in cafes, workplaces, pubs; in fact just about anywhere that a self-respecting Australian dog lover would kick them out of.<br>I once jostled through a crowded commuter train in west London only to step on the tail of a mixed-breed. Being a dog, he yelped as though someone was about to kill him.<br>I gave him a nasty look, muttered ?stupid dog?, and looked around the carriage for assurance. All I got were malevolent dark glares; as if I'd said something unmentionable in front of the Queen (?That Di's got a nice bottom? or suchlike.)<br>But now - is this an urban myth? - the doggy has been usurped by the moggy. Latest animal census figures show that more people keep cats as their main family pet.<br>This rise to prominence has not given the cat any special favours however. Dogs are top dog with the police and councils and petty bureaucrats still.<br>Humourist Alan Coren wrote in The Times last week about this phenomenon. He had cause to test England's official view of the cat as top pet because one had been flattened on the road outside his house at breakfastime.<br>In Coren's words: ?It had been flattened, and it was all too pitiably evident that the later the morning had grown, the flatter had grown the cat, so that matters had now reached a point where some kind of expert would be required to separate it from the tarmac. And, furthermore, to notify the bereaved. So I rang the police.?<br>And the Bill was no help. The police will pull out all the official stops to deal with a dead, or merely missing, dog.<br>The cat, alive or dead, has no status in the eyes of the constabulary.<br>They informed him cat cases were ?non-notifiable?. He was told to ring the local council who would ?send a bloke round to scrape it up?. The scraper took longer than expected and Coren grew worried. The cat was getting flatter as the traffic grew.<br>Coren toyed with the idea of putting a notice in the window of the corner deli to alert the owner. But what to write? ?Asking if anyone has lost a tyre-coloured moggy three feet square??<br>Until the law does change the dog will still have its day in England whether it is in normal robust health or fit only to be posted under the door.<br></font></p>
