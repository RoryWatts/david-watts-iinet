            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ARMIES of Telstra workers are making life hell for Perth people in wheelchairs, mothers with prams and the near-sighted.<br>They're digging up footpaths to lay kilometres of cable, leaving red and white ribbons to rope off the excavations.<br>The cables lie in wait, hibernating like thin snakes ready to strike at householders willing to fork out good money next June for cable TV when Foxtel, then Optus Vision, are ready to stupefy viewers with channels and more channels.<br>Will it be worth it? Foxtel will charge $19.95 for installation of a TV-top decoder hooked up to its cable and $39.95 a month for its basic package of 20 channels including Premier Sports, Showtime, Encore, Discovery Channel, Cartoon Network, CNN International and BBC World.<br>The Internet newsgroup aus.tv has been the scene of spirited discussion in the past month since Foxtel's prices became known. The question was whether $500 a year would be well spent if people signed up with Foxtel or other pay-TV operators.<br>This suggestion and the response suggest pay-TV will not be an instant success:<br>?I think within one year 80 per cent of houses in Australia will have or will have had some form of pay-TV. With the cheap installation and subscription prices how can anyone resist the temptation to have a look.?<br>But the reply is: ?Lots of people. Are you in the industry? Give me one person who wants it and can afford it and I'll give you at least 10 who don't. That won't change for a while yet. Not within a year.?<br>The following gives more room for thought:<br>?Sure $500 a year sounds reasonable. Sorry, make that $1000 if you want both pay-TV systems. Wait, you want that extra odd channel here and there? That will cost extra. You want to watch pay-TV in the lounge room and the bedroom? You will need an extra decoder.<br>?Considering that free-to-air TV is still going to be around, and the video rental market will try to cash in on the programs that are lost to pay-TV, there will be enough alternatives to encourage people not to switch over.?<br>Recently, aus.tv carried a FAQ (list of frequently asked questions) about pay-TV by Liron Lightwood, a Melbourne computer programmer and pay-TV ?nut?. Like aus.tv, the FAQ asked: ?Why pay for TV when I can watch regular TV free??<br>Mr Lightwood's view: ?Newspapers and magazines that you pay for provide many things better than the ones that are free.?<br>The FAQ will be posted monthly in aus.tv, or possibly fortnightly as Foxtel and Optus begin their invasions.<br></font></p>
