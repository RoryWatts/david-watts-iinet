            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet was expected to close today but now appears likely to be open for business as usual, despite prophecies of doom.<br>Warnings of the February 29 ?leap day? closure have been circulating worldwide for two weeks.<br>The global E-mail warning of closure came from a Kim Dereksen, who purports to be from the interconnected network maintenance staff (main branch) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.<br>His warning said the Net had to be closed for cleaning each Leap Year, on February 29.<br>The cleaning, he said, eliminated dead E-mail and inactive sites on the Net.<br>?Five powerful Internet-crawling robots situated around the world will search the Internet and delete any data that they find,? Mr Dereksen wrote.<br>He advised Net users - 30 million in the US and probably one million in Australia - to disconnect all terminals and networks, shut all Internet servers and refrain from connecting to the Net.<br>The warning was greeted with scepticism and down-right disbelief on the Net in Australia.<br>In the newsgroup - electronic bulletin board - aus.general, correspondents exchanged dozens of views about the Leap Day warning.<br>A posting by one user alerting others to the cleaning day and saying he hoped they did not think it a hoax was answered promptly by one saying:<br>?I'll enjoy the 29th on the Net while you are huddled in the corner with your computer in its anti-static, anti-internet-crawling robot shielding.?<br>The original correspondent hit back questioning users about whether they had been on-line in 1992 or whether they had read special directives on the Leap Day warning posted some years ago.<br>Immediately, about a dozen users responded that they had worked all day on February 29, 1992, without a worry.<br>Examination of the on-line directives over the years revealed they had all been written on April 1.<br>The giveaway was that one spoke of a new software protocol called Sonnet to Sonnet Translation - it was signed by ?William Shakespeare, Globe Communications, London?.<br>?The Internet is not controlled by any central body.<br></font></p>
