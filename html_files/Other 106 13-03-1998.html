            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">COLLEAGUE Susan Maushart - the GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) who fills this space on Tuesdays - had the gall this week to say that husbands and fathers were not grown-ups. Harumph.<br>Let me tell you exactly how grown up we are. This is an example from real life. In fact, the events described happened less than a week ago. They are so fresh in my mind I can taste them.<br>Last Friday, several mates and I found ourselves deserted for the weekend. Our GYMs absconded on what they call the girls' weekend. It is an annual event now in its eighth year and eagerly anticipated not only by the participants, but also by the blokes and kids they leave behind.<br>The words peace and quiet spring to mind.<br>The girls lock themselves up with girlie videos, girlie food like salads and fruit, and girlie passions like drinking oodles of wine and complaining about their husbands.<br>We blokes, meanwhile, are left to protect the young "uns and cook, clean and organise for an entire weekend. Or not, as the case may be.<br>Contrary to what Ms Maushart thinks, we perform these duties in a very grown-up way.<br>Sure, one dad misplaced the kids on the first night. But that can happen to anyone who has to break away from after-work drinks on a steaming Friday night. And they all came back in one piece.<br>On the first night of non-GYM bliss, my son and I took a stroll together for a bit of male bonding. The stroll led us, as fate would have it, to Red Rooster. A chicken, some wedges and a couple of bottles of Coke later, we chanced on a video shop. Liar, Liar with Jim Carrey proved an excellent choice, and a new Nintendo64 game was also a treat. A huge block of chocolate . . . why not?<br>ABOUT halfway through Liar, Liar, while both lying on the floor, the burps and smelly noises started. Takeaway chook, Coke and Snack chocolate is not a combination to sneeze at, quite literally.<br>It was an early night, 11-ish or so by the time we had finished a stage or two of Goldeneye on the Nintendo.<br>Next morning: the beds could wait to be made - who was going to see them? - it was teeball, which meant more soft drink to cool down after the hot defeat. Another video game, some golf on the box, a bit of Grand Prix . . . why not? Had to be in form for the Ansett Cup that night.<br>Lunch? A few bits of chicken, plenty of Coke left. And, look, some ice-cream.<br>Dinner in front of the footy was home-delivered pizza, more ice-cream, more Coke. Then more TV, more video games. The kids were clearly enjoying this very grown-up version of child-rearing.<br>Next day one of the other dads came to visit. We had some beers and made sure the kids were looked after . . . more Coke and video games. I went to watch TV, and the kids, obviously maturing by the minute, made their own lunch. Ah well, ice-cream and Coke on a hot day won't kill them.<br>All too soon it was over and the GYMs were back in town. After inspecting the house, my wife and I sat down to catch up on our respective weekends. I might have omitted some of the ice-cream and Coke from my retelling. But then again she might have omitted some of the gems of girlie conversation about drongo husbands.<br>As night fell, she said she would get the dinner. Strangely enough I was sort of looking forward to a bit of home cooking. And the kids did look just a tad pale and bloated.<br>For some reason she hopped in the car, returning 20 minutes later with . . . Hungry Jack's.<br>Very grown-up indeed.<br></font></p>
