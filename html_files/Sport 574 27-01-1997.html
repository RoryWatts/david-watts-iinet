            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE first hot-cross buns appeared in the bakeries last week when the temperature topped 38C again. There is still ham left from Christmas Day for goodness sake.<br>But it means Easter is foreseeable (end of March). And footy is not far behind.<br>To whet supporters' appetites, Channel 7 is running a show called Thirsty For Footy. It had its second outing under the expert command of velvet-voiced Dennis Cometti yesterday.<br>But why? We will have more than half a year of footy soon enough; pre-season competition, AFL home and away, then finals, and of course the WAFL (which is forced to hide its light under a bushel).<br>Surely that is enough of the great game for anyone.<br>Obviously, Seven knows some of the same people I do. For example, I have been asked in November, about Melbourne Cup time: ?Are you missing the footy, Dave??<br>It is really a rhetorical question. The person is trying in a round-about way to say he (never a she) wants footy on Friday nights, Saturday afternoons and Sunday prime-time all year round.<br>Some of them get their jollies by warming up the video and cooling the tinnies for a replay of the 1992 grand final in which West Coast changed the course of history by defeating Geelong.<br>Thirsty For Footy will be a fix for them. Yesterday, it showed the 1964 WAFL grand final, won by Claremont in the dying minute over East Fremantle.<br>It also put Hawthorn under the spotlight, with Cometti interrogating coach Ken Judge. Cometti was less than charitable in his introduction, saying there would be as much re-soling of slippers as re-studding of boots considering the number of Hawk stars over 30.<br>But we were able to learn from Judge that champion full forward Jason Dunstall was due back early in the season and was ?travelling well?.<br>You can trust coaches can't you?<br>THE Australian Open in Melbourne had a warm second week, bringing much good and exciting sport into living rooms.<br>Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis turned out easy winners, but neither Carlos Moya nor Mary Pierce did their career any harm by reaching the finals when unseeded.<br>The Spanish Press was gaga about the sleepy-eyed Barcelona sex symbol Moya. On Saturday, the venerable Madrid journal El Pais said this in a preview of the men's final: ?El espaol Carles Moy deber enfrentarse al norteamericano Pete Sampras, el numero uno del mundo, en busca del que sera su primer ttulo del Grand Slam. Sampras venci ayer sin grandes dificultades al austriaco Thomas Muster . . .?<br>Haven't a clue what it means, but suspect it translates roughly as : "It's a big ask for our own Carlos Moya to beat Pete Sampras?.<br>???<br>GOOD to see Matthew Hayden riding his luck and scoring the Test century many suspected he was capable of.<br>It was also good to see SBS televise the Australia-Norway soccer on Saturday night, showing in the process the skilful chess-like nature of the game which is too often shortened to spectacular highlights in other shows.<br></font></p>
