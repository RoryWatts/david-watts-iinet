            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I HAVE been in Melbourne on urgent business. To prove that I am not rorting the travel expenses, I hereby tender a diary of the events that took place while there.<br>Tuesday, September 23: Vitally important strategy session cancelled so I put on a tourist hat and tour the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Leave after small disagreement with jolly nice tour guide over whose image in bronze is above the members' gates. She said Victor Trumper. I said Hugh Trumble. Whatever, it looked like Henry Lawson in a funny hat.<br>Wednesday, September 24: Evening policy session failed to materialise. Instead, I go to the Glasshouse where, as fate would have it, the Perth Wildcats are playing North Melbourne Giants - the fans call them the Joyants when they chant - in a vital National Basketball League game.<br>Suspicions that Victoria is a sports-mad police State are confirmed when the girl comes out to sing the national anthem. She is carried by two policeman because, not only is she a policewoman, but she has also had a knee reconstruction, just like Glen Jakovich, Chris Mainwaring and Sean MacManus.<br>Critics say every basketball game should start with the teams on 100-all and that there need only be two minutes play. I disagree, although curiously this game is 100-all with two minutes to play. Perth wins 106-102, Ricky Grace is the Darren Jarman of the NBL, and as one of only five Wildcats fans in the crowd of 5000, I am delirious with joy.<br>Thursday, September 25: Long business lunch does not eventuate. Have a long non-business lunch instead. The venue is the Blue Train, a cafe on the south bank of the Yarra so trendy that most of the waiters have pierced tongues. Thus, when they tell you the day's specialities it sounds like this: ?Um, wi go focasha, bruheha, spahetti maraarra. Wo you li??<br>Friday, September 26: Trying to cross Collins Street to get to a pulse-quickening seminar, am interrupted by the grand final parade. Footballers sit atop Saab convertibles looking seriously nervous and very young while 100,000 people shower them with ticker-tape. Feel out of place as I am not wearing red, black and white face paint.<br>SATURDAY, September 27: At serious breakfast attended by 1600 others, a man rides his horse into the gathering while lights blaze on and off . . . on the man and horse. I think he is singing Like a Nine Stone Cowboy, but I'm a bit deaf.<br>Seek solace by going to the MCG again. Lo and behold, 99,000 others are doing the same thing. And what a surprise, there is a grand final on.<br>Pre-match entertainment is so big that next year they will have to launch the space shuttle to top it. Match goes pretty much as expected except that Adelaide wins.<br>The unfortunate immediate side-effect is that the dreadful Crows theme song, We're the Pride of South Australia, is played at migraine-inducing levels 25 times . . . that's in the ground. Outside it and for hours after groups of Crows fans are bellowing the song all over the wet and windy streets. This is unfortunate because it has only one verse so they change the words of St Kilda's song to ?Oh when the Crows come marchin' in, oh when the? etc. Make a mental note not to make a business trip to Adelaide for at least the next 50 years.<br>Sunday, September 28: Business associates fail to materialise at a windswept and dirty Moonee Valley. Put travel expenses on a sure thing in race five. Travel expenses finish fifth. Attempts to recoup them finish eighth in the seventh and seventh in the eighth.<br>Monday, September 29: Realise that I am stuck in Melbourne until I can beg the fare home and rort the expenses.<br>Have learnt one thing: Betting IS the curse of the working man, particularly on these high-profile business trips.<br></font></p>
