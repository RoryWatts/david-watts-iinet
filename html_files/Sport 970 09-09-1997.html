            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IMAGINE Mick Malthouse commentating on the Adelaide-West Coast final on Sunday.<br>It sounds bizarre, even though the intense Eagles coach is capable of some of the better, if more enigmatic, lines on the game.<br>Remember ?The ox is slow but the earth is patient?? On Sunday, he had: ?The most obvious (thing that went wrong) was losing the game.?<br>Well, TV viewers had a rough parallel with a Malthouse commentary during the US Open tennis final served as a sporting feast by Channel 9 around breakfast.<br>Queensland-born Bermuda resident Pat Rafter beat Montreal-born Englishman Greg Rusedski in a brilliant match. Observing from the commentary box for Nine was Rafter's Davis Cup captain and Australian tennis legend John Newcombe.<br>Newc could not resist coaching his powerful charge, particularly as he fought to overcome Rusedski's impressive counter-attack in what turned out to be the final set.<br>There was no evidence that the tide was turning either way, the contest was so even. But in the box, Newc, and to a lesser extent his Australian colleague with the growing American accent Fred Stolle (?all you folks back home?), started some very one-sided barracking.<br>Newcombe: We need a low backhand volley (Rafter obliges).<br>Newcombe: Yes!<br>Stolle: All right. Just relax now, just relax.<br>Newcombe: I will if he gets the ball low down at his feet.<br>Stolle: Remember it's only a game, Newc (chuckles to himself).<br>Newcombe proceeded in similar vein to get his boy to match point. He threw in several emphatic yeses, a well done and a fatherly, ?Okay, don't overplay it now.?<br>On the big point, he advised: ?Wide serve, then backhand cross-court volley.?<br>Rafter did not follow the script, preferring to go straight at Rusedski. He won anyway.<br>Then followed some wonderful moments of exhilaration as he performed effortlessly the Pat Cash climb into the crowd to hug his support team.<br>And that attracted some wry comments from Newc, too. ?Not too much hugging of Rochie (his coach Tony Roche). He doesn't like that.?<br>To cap it off, Newc interviewed the overjoyed champion and signed off with the ominous threat that he would give him a kiss when the cameras went off.<br>All in all it was parochial, one-sided and biased.<br>But it was also great fun and right in the slot if you were a passionate supporter of Australian tennis wanting a slice of triumph after a 10-year drought.<br>The question of having one-sided commentators is a vexed one. Newcombe can carry it off because, for a start, he is a much-admired Australian champion.<br>He also has a nice sense of humour and offers good insights into the game and players.<br>Tennis on this scale can also afford this sort of bias because it is a contest between individuals, and despite Rafter's win, one in which Australians often need all the support they can get.<br>If Rafter had lost it might have been a different proposition.<br>For the moment the old saying applies: ?Winners are grinners.?<br></font></p>
