            <h3>Author: DAVID WATTS</h3>
            <h3>Date: 23-07-1999</h3>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN 1876, an internal memo at the Western Union telegraph company in the US said: ?The telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.?<br>Then in 1962, after listening to a group called the Beatles, Decca Recording Company executives said: ?We don't like their sound and guitar music is on the way out.?<br>And on Sunday, July 18, 1999, David Watts, after watching the Eagles go three goals-to-nothing ahead of the Dockers said: ?West Coast by six goals . . . at least.?<br>All famous last words, indeed.<br>The tragic events at Subiaco Oval - seen in the flesh by 36,500 people, and live on Channel 7 by an estimated 465,000 - have changed this city indelibly.<br>For a start you can hardly move for the bandwagons roaming the streets. People of all shapes and sizes are shouting, ?Drummy you beaut? and ?heave ho? as they wave stupid little inflatable anchors and hop on.<br>And the F--- word is suddenly fashionable.<br>You might gather - correctly as it happens - that I am an Eagles supporter and was not particularly thrilled by F---'s 47-point win.<br>It has been a hard week. Gloating F--- supporters keep ringing and e-mailing, trying to rub it in.<br>I tell them:<br>So you won one match out of 10, big deal.One win in five years, not very good is it?<br>Have a look at your Dockers calendar, I bet it doesn't have September in it.<br>So you played it like a grand final. That's the only finals action you'll see for a while.<br>You know what they call a Dockers' quarter-time huddle don't you - it's a dope ring.<br>All to no avail. The stock response has been: ?Nyaah, nyaah, na-na-na. We beat ya, we beat ya.? It is not all that surprising really when you consider that 78 per cent of respondents to a newspaper's Internet survey this week answered ?yes? to the question: ?Was watching the Dockers beat West Coast better than sex??<br>Interestingly, 21 per cent said ?no?, leaving one per cent who said neither. Presumably these F--- supporters are still saying: ?Mummy, what is sex?? The Net is a young medium, after all.<br>But why believe my ravings about F--- supporters? Here are some wise words posted in a Net football discussion group earlier this week by a Perth man. Coincidentally, they echo my opinion of this sad and sorry week. And coincidentally again, their author, Peter Nevin, just happens to be an Eagles supporter. What a stroke of luck.<br>?As West Coast supporters, all we ever hear about is the diehard, salt-of-the-earth, stick-it-out-to-the-siren Dockers as defenders of the spirit of real football in WA versus the panty-waisted, chardonnay-quaffing, Jeep-driving, fair-weather theatregoers who apparently support my team . . . bollocks,? Mr Nevin wrote.<br>?For a start, greater Fremantle is as working class as Rose Porteous. The Dockers don't have any mortgage on genuine diehard football support. And, of course, the Eagles have experienced the inevitable side-effect of their own success.<br>?As all of us in Perth are seeing this week, it's only taken one win for all of the fair-weather closet Dockers to come tumbling out of the woodwork. So West Coast hardly has a mortgage on that either.<br>?Still, Freo has given Perth some good times. As Eagles supporters, we smiled when the Dockers revealed their test-pattern guernsey and played the dirge for the first time . . . And don't get me started on the inflatable anchors.?<br>Mr Nevin did admit that F--- was much the better team on the day.<br>But enough of that. What this column needs right now is some more famous last words, as it is rapidly approaching its end. I'm stuck for some of my own, so try these: ?I am about to - or I am going to - die. Either expression is correct*.?<br>These were the last gasps of Dominique Bouhours, a French grammarian, who died in 1702.<br>(* I'm not really. But I have been invited to watch F--- play tomorrow night.)<br></font></p>
