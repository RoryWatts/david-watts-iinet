            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Make your searching quicker, accurate and more efficient with the Access guide to ..<br>Two tools are invaluable when browsing the Web - patience and a good search engine. You have to learn patience yourself. But this Access guide may help you understand search engines a little better. With that understanding, the daunting task of finding information among the more than 100 million Web pages might become friendlier.<br>How they work<br>True engines, such as HotBot or AltaVista, create lists automatically by crawling the Web with intelligent programs known as spiders or robots.<br>Page titles, body copy, meta tags, popularity and other elements all play a role in where a page will be listed. Submitting your URL to an engine gives it a better chance of being listed, despite the automation.<br>Directories such as Yahoo are often mistaken for search engines. In technical terms, Yahoo is not an engine, but in practical terms it is as good or better than many of its automated cousins. Directories depend on humans for listings. Users submit short descriptions of their sites or directory editors review them. Then the sites are added to a searchable database.<br>The moving parts<br>Search engines have three major elements. The spider, crawler or robot visits Web pages, reads them and follows links to other pages within the site. It returns on a regular basis to check changes.<br>Everything the spider finds goes into the second part, the index. The index contains a copy of every page found. Until a page is indexed - and that can take time - it is not available to searchers.<br>Search software is the third part of an engine. This sifts through the index to find matches to a search and rank them.<br>How pages are ranked<br>The key criteria are location and frequency. Pages with keywords in the title are assumed to be more relevant than others to the topic.<br>For example, if you search for "Hamlet', an engine will rank the Hamlet Page higher than the Complete Works of Shakespeare.<br>Engines also check whether keywords appear in the headline or in the first few paragraphs of text.<br>An engine will also analyse how often keywords appear in relation to other words in a page. Those with a higher frequency are often deemed more relevant.<br>However, most engines are programmed to detect the gentle art of spamming - where a page author loads the title, meta tags (HTML tags describing the contents) and text on purpose to promote their site. An example is when a word is repeated hundreds of times to increase the frequency and propel the page higher in the listings.<br>Features to look for<br>Each engine does things slightly differently. The way they check the Web, and what they look at, can dictate whether they are appropriate for the searches you want to undertake.<br>A comprehensive chart at the excellent Search Engine Watch site lists in detail how the main engines do their work. These are some of the fields covered:Content: There are two distinct ways engines index pages. One is by full-text where every word on a page is included for search software to sift through.<br>The other is the abstract method where engines create a condensed copy of a page, meaning frequency and location of keywords are more important.<br>Full-text search engines can be better because every word from a site will be available to match keywords entered by searchers.<br>But abstract engines may cause some pages to perform better in rankings because those with high-content keywords stay that way when condensed.<br>Pages with less content lose relevancy when condensed.<br>All the popular engines - AltaVista, HotBot, Infoseek,WebCrawler and Lycos - are full-text.<br>Size: Big is better. Engines with big indexes have many more pages listed. Excite and HotBot are categorised as big, with about 55 million pages in their indexes. AltaVista and Lycos are medium with 30 million and WebCrawler is small with two million.<br>Pages crawled: Engines that crawl through more pages a day are more likely to have fresher indexes with more relevant entries for a search.<br>However, some engines which do not crawl as far have ways of detecting the frequency of page changes. This helps keep indexes fresh too.<br>HotBot looks at up to 10 million pages a day compared with the three million checked by AltaVista and Excite.<br>Submitted pages: In a perfect world, the spiders will find a page automatically. But a page stands a better chance of making an index if it is submitted.Infoseek is said to have pages on its index within minutes of submission. AltaVista takes a day. Excite, Lycos and WebCrawler take about three weeks, according to Search Engine Watch.<br>Link popularity: Engines can determine the popularity of pages by how many links there are to it from other pages. Some use popularity as a factor in ranking pages for a search. If two pages have an equal number of keywords, the one that is linked to by more pages will win a higher ranking.<br>Overall<br>Trial and error is often the only way to decide on a search engine. It is a good idea to have two or three bookmarked so that if one fails to find what you are looking for, you can switch to another.<br>The new Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 browsers have major search engines available under a menu command and this delivers both speed and choice when surfing.<br>Sites such as Search.com and Starting Point also have wide ranges of engines and are easy to use.<br>HELP DESK<br>HotBot: www.hotbot.com<br>AltaVista: www.altavista.yellowpages.com.au<br>Yahoo: www.yahoo.com<br>Search Engine Watch: searchenginewatch.com<br>Infoseek: www.infoseek.com<br>WebCrawler: www.webcrawler.com<br>Lycos: www.lycos.com<br>Excite: www.excite.com<br>Search.com: www.search.com<br>Starting Point: www.stpt.com<br>Wombat (Australia only): www.intercom.com.au/wombat/<br></font></p>
