            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS tempting to feel sorry for English sports lovers today.<br>Their teams have given them hope, but no glory in two vastly different arenas at opposite ends of the world - in two traditionally English games.<br>On Saturday night, the Australian rugby union team contrived to give England as much chance as possible to restore savaged pride at Twickenham after the record 76-0 defeat in Brisbane earlier this year.<br>And yesterday, Australia somehow drew out the second Test at the WACA Ground to 2½ days before completing a seven-wicket win.<br>The rugby was available live to Foxtel viewers. It was hardly lively. Most of the action came from the New Zealand referee who hammered the Wallabies 19-9 in penalties but still managed to award the dubious free kick that John Eales put through to snatch a 12-11 win.<br>The Wallabies were tired after a long season.<br>And the English had forgotten how to win, although they did manage the only try, a beauty to Jeremy Guscott.<br>The grey masses under the uninviting west London skies witnessed a team lacking confidence rather than one lacking talent.<br>The sunny and colourful mobs at the WACA Ground saw much the same thing at the cricket.<br>Despite impressions from Channel 9 and ABC radio coverage, the English supporters were not all members of the ?Barmy Army?.<br>Many were recognisable by their creaseless complexions and creaseless Australian summer clothes.<br>Minutes after England's first innings, I overheard some of them in the Prindiville Stand.<br>?Not very good is it, 112? Will you be here tomorrow?? ?Yes, the beer will be cold.<br>?And that Alex Tudor looks good.?<br>More of these hopeful sentiments were expressed yesterday on ABC radio when the much vilified Graeme Hick was leading the English fightback.<br>Jonathan Agnew reminded all - half seriously - of Headingley in 1981 when England was 7-135 in its second innings and in little danger of forcing Australia to bat again.<br>Ian Botham then hit 149 not out and Bob Willis took 8-43 to snatch a famous 500/1 victory.<br>At least the English at the WACA and Aggers and crew got to see this amazing Perth Test in some comfort. In England, the faithful have had to watch or listen between about 3am and breakfast. Fans on the Internet have been telling how they manage to stay awake.<br>The best was one who described how he came home from work at 6pm, went straight to the pub until 11pm, then brought an Indian takeaway and a bottle of vodka home in front of the TV.<br>Unfortunately, he passed out repeatedly, coming in and out of a coma with every wicket.<br>His joint would have been jumping during the past few days.<br>But should we feel sorry for them?<br>Not while they have the ghost of Headingley 1981. No one-eyed Australian can forgive them that.<br></font></p>
