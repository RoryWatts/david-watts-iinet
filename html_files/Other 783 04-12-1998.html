            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ENGLISH cricket writer Martin Johnson remarked recently that Australia was such an anti-tobacco country he would not be surprised to see the hit movie Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels renamed Lock, Stock and Non-Smoking Barrels.<br>As one who has the odd, quiet fag I would have to agree. It is very rare these days to find a place where you can actually enjoy a cigarette. And it is certainly no surprise to see WA may have anti-smoking ?police? to stop people lighting up in declared areas.<br>This is the land of the nicotine nazi. It is probably for the better. Even a recalcitrant like me enjoys smoke-free workplaces and entertainment areas; places that have no dreadful, eye-stinging fug.<br>I know if I want that I can skulk off somewhere the sea breeze is howling and try to light my fag and ensure the main polluting is done to my person and mine alone.<br>There are many places one can go to at least cut down the habit.<br>One is the WACA Ground. The other day I was watching gallant English batsmen striving to make double figures when I spotted an obvious England fan (he had a wig with the St George Cross), trying to make his way to his seat at the front of the Inverarity Stand. Unfortunately, he also had a fag in one hand (and a beer in the other, but that's permissible).<br>The security guard gave him a right ticking off and the poor Pom disappeared behind the stands. Back there - yes I had to go, too - the air was laden with smoke. And English accents. Many were complaining about not being able to smoke while watching the Test. As if smoke would somehow deaden their pain.<br>Test cricket is not available all the time as a way to cut down. Let's face it, even when it is available it is not on for the advertised time and is enough to make you take up smoking with a vengeance as a result. But other places of entertainment are.<br>The day after the cricket I had the happy task of paying for my daughter's dance lessons. Not in money, mind you. That had been done already. But at this time of the year you pay by witnessing the traditional concert.<br>I haven't anything against watching the fruit of my loins display her talents (she's brilliant of course). It's just that she was in Act 25 of a 27-act concert. And we poor punters and parents had to be seated from Act 1 . . . three hours before No. 25.<br>Acts 1 to umpteen featured the four and five-year-olds, who are cute and delightful, but dance in a way only their parents could appreciate. It is possible to fume while you watch this. But not with a Benson and Hedges stuck between your yellowing teeth.<br>Other spots where it is difficult to light up include:Self-serve petrol stations;Supermarket checkout queues (even if they have 100 brands of cigarettes on offer);The front pews of a church (during the service);In the Confessional (unless the priest is a consenting adult);Public galleries at the courts and Parliament House;While preparing salads in an open-plan restaurant;The deep end of swimming pools (while duck-diving);The shallow end of the ocean (while avoiding boogie boards);In bed while sleeping.<br>And if you can't get to any of these, fellow smokers might take comfort in the claim nicotine is believed to prevent Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, few have survived the ravages of smoking long enough to prove it beyond doubt.<br></font></p>
