            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE biggest film in Perth at the moment is the Robert Redford weepie, The Horse Whisperer. Guaranteed to drive up sales of tissues - either for crying or barfing into, depending on taste - it is adapted from the 10-million-selling book of the same name by one Nicholas Evans.<br>Evans treated his subject of a girl, her deranged horse, her sexy mum and a so-down-to-earth-aw-shucks cowboy with magical power over horses so well that Michele Phillips, the editor of the You section, was moved to write ever so delicately that the work was ?vomit-making?.<br>I find it hard to disagree with that opinion of the book. It seems to have been written with an eye to the bottom line that some Wild West-loving Hollywood hero - say Robert Redford - would gobble up the film rights and make a movie so sweeping, so picturesque and so devoid of anything resembling reality that it would make a squillion dollars and perpetuate the myth that even the most stressed city woman could move to the country, fall in love with a cowboy and be happy.<br>However, I have not seen the film, so will suspend judgment. Except to say that I think it is yet another diabolical example of the over-glorification of horses in works of drama.Horses have always had it good. From The Black Stallion to Equus to My Friend Flicka to every cowboy film ever made, they are the romantics and often the heroes.<br>Caligula made his a senator, Richard III would have given his kingdom for one, and any number of screen cowboys from John Wayne to Clint Eastwood have preferred their company to that of a woman.<br>And we city folk have just gone along with it all, dumbly accepting that a horse, because it can look so poetic in slow motion, deserves this hoo-ha.<br>But have you ever backed one at the races? Have you offered one a carrot and nearly had your hand removed? And have you ever tried to whisper in one's ear?<br>Horse reality is dark. It is time to eschew it in favour of something far more friendly and closer to everyday experience. Enter the dog. And the consequent book and squillion-dollar-making film, The Dog Whisperer.<br>Here is a draft synopsis: In the still of a snow-covered morning in upstate New York, a girl out walking her dog is hit by a 40-tonne truck. Though horribly injured, both 13-year-old Grace and her dog, You Idiot, survive. But the impact on their lives and the lives of those who love them is devastating. Grace is the only child of prominent magazine editor, Annie Graves, who hears about a man in Montana, a ?whisperer? who is said to have the gift of healing dogs. (She looks up W in the Yellow Pages).<br>The man's name is Tom and he models for R. M. Williams. He lives on the Rocky Mountain Front, a place of daunting beauty, where all their lives are changed forever . . .Not bad huh? Actually I have just taken the synopsis of The Horse Whisperer and substituted the word dog. Although this sounds lazy, I did do a lot of research on dog whispering in an effort to come up with an original plot. But dog whispering is actually a very complicated art.<br>First, one has to shout at the dog to get it to sit still enough so that it can be approached for a quick whisper. Then - if the dog is a spaniel or other droopy-eared breed - you have to lift the ear like a tent flap to whisper. When you whisper, the results vary. The dog can lick your face, cower in fright, bite your nose off or just stand there looking puzzled.<br>So, I'll stick to the plagiarised version of The Horse Whisperer and await Robert Redford's call.<br>Then it will be my shout.<br></font></p>
