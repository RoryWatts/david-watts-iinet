            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET use leads to depression, says a heavyweight report by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh released to the world last week.<br>Paedophiles with pictures to turn the stomach are using the Net as a pornographic playground, it also emerged last week when a worldwide police effort struck in 21 countries.<br>Young ALP staff members were sacked for hacking into the Liberal Party's official election site. They replaced valid links with ones to porn sites.<br>All very worrying, very negative reading. I am taking a few weeks off. It sounds like the perfect time to disconnect from the Net and smell the roses of real life.<br>But despite the bad vibrations the past week has dished out, I doubt that I will.<br>The cliche about every dark cloud having a silver lining is true ... even when that cloud is in cyberspace.<br>The paedophiles are the type of slime the vast majority of the Net population - 100 million worldwide - can do something about.<br>Several Web sites exist with the sole purpose of tracking down and exposing paedophiles. They call for - and should get - full cooperation from concerned users.<br>One called Pedowatch is particularly informative and includes recommendations to parents and guardians about making Web surfing the enriching and informative experience it should be.<br>The hacker attack on the Liberals was pure vandalism of an adolescent nature. Strangely, the hacking raised little comment from political discussion groups such as the Usenet newsgroup aus.politics.<br>The group receives more than 300 e-mails a day about political issues, but late last week only a dozen dealt with the Liberal hacking. Most of those branded it vandalism that could not be condoned.<br>As for depression, who can say? Use of the Net and the part it plays in ?real life? is a personal issue.<br>If I were to log off for a few weeks I know I would be more depressed than if I stayed connected.<br>Here is what I would miss:<br>?The election - already well covered by this paper and occasionally by TV. But the Net broadens the coverage considerably. Each party has its own Web site where it releases policies which can be read online or copied to disk, allowing users to draw their own conclusions.<br>David Moss' Australian Politics site is a must starting point in seeking out all parties, and has many useful links to topical events.<br>Sites like the WA Young Liberals Think Out Loud page and Matilda's Political Message Board allow robust debate. You can join in or sit back and see what the emerging issues are.<br>If you feel inclined to talk directly to a Federal politician, the Australian Parliament House site gives e-mail addresses.<br>(You may not get a response. It depends a lot on the techno-literacy of politicians and their staff).<br>?The Clinton-Lewinsky affair - unfortunately the US President cannot go about his business of calming Russia or Ireland without stumbling over the fly buttons left undone in this case.<br>The Web is brimming over with the latest, from the jokes to serious analysis. Sleazy cyber-journalist Matt Drudge and his Drudge Report is a great place to start investigating. And you can always rely on CNN.<br>?The Commonwealth Games, the US Open etc, etc - actually the Net has so much to recommend it, I don't know why I would seriously consider some time without it.<br>HELP DESK<br>Depression report:<br>homenet.andrew.cmu.edu/progress/<br>ovrview8697.html<br>Pedowa Moss's Australian Politics:<br>plato.itsc.adfa.edu.au/apr/<br>Young Liberals:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~gdyoung/Think-temp.htm<br>Matilda Political Messages:<br>www.aaa.com.au/matilda/<br>republic/letters.shtml<br>Parliam index:<br>www.aph.gov.au/parlindx.htm<br>Drudge Report:<br>www.drudgereport.com<br>CNN:<br>www.cnn.com<br></font></p>
