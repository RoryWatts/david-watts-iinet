            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Striptease (MA)<br>Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds<br>Directed by Andrew Bergman<br>? ?<br>NO, VOYEURS, Demi Moore does not expose everything in Striptease. She almost does but some plot twist - daughter poking her seven-year-old nose through the curtains or drunken man grabbing her long legs - always intervenes.<br>What the viewer does see is more of Moore than ever before, despite these intrusions. And she is a sight for sore eyes with the toned body of a 90s athlete to strut her stuff.<br>It is all totally unnecessary, too. The strip club setting does nothing for a film that cannot decide whether it is straight comedy, farce or drama.<br>Striptease could just as easily have been called Night Nurse and set in a hospital, or Traffic Cop, or Rubbishwoman ... anything really.<br>Director Andrew Bergman is noted for his comedies like The Freshman and Honeymoon in Vegas. Presumably he lost control of this film to the powerful Moore, who wanted motherly love to dominate sex romps.<br>The idea that Moore as Erin Grant, secretary at the Miami office of the FBI but sacked because her husband is a pill-popping scumbag, has to resort to stripping to earn enough money to appeal against a custody order, is far fetched.<br>It does allow lots of flesh and bumping and grinding, none of which is terribly sexy because it probably seems too real. Some artistic licence is needed as is decent choreography.<br>Moore does not know which genre she is in. The novel Striptease by Carl Hiaasen made all the characters funny. Moore's Erin is a devoutly serious mother determined to win back her child, bringing some gritty determination to the part.<br>Everyone else plays it for laughs, however. The most outlandish is Burt Reynolds as Congressman David Dillbeck, up for re-election, but a real eye-rolling boofhead who lets his head be ruled by other parts of his anatomy.<br>Thus he falls madly for Erin and will do anything to have her. This includes colluding with crooked sugar tycoons, who pay their workers slave wages, to bump off anyone who finds evidence of Dillbeck's philandering.<br>This murderous bent draws the attention of Al Garcia (Armand Assante) a straight-as-a-die Miami policeman who becomes obsessed with both Dillbeck's connections to murders and Grant's custody battle with the no-good Darrell (Robert Patrick).<br>Deals are done and there is much double-crossing but Erin is far too smart and serious for everyone else, who are either blissed out on drugs or, in Dillbeck's case, incapable of rational human thought.<br>The film bumps and grinds slowly for a sludgy first half, but the second half, in which Erin and Dillbeck are thrown together, sorts itself out as farce and works better with some genuine action and laughs.<br>Taken as a whole, Striptease borders on the type of F-grade farce that television shows for adolescents late on Sunday nights.<br>It escapes this fate by having good talent. Moore, though acting out of synch, is convincing; and Reynolds, though too campy, has a certain screen magic that brings laughter.<br>There are some good laughs . . . a few titters among the titillation so to speak. Dillbeck, due to address a Young Christian meeting, is found covered in Vaseline and wearing a big hat and shorts.<br>He is fished out and makes a truly American speech about family values.<br></font></p>
