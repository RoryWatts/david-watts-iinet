            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FOR some unfathomable reason, Shane Warne bowls chainsaws in his latest television advertisement. The chainsaw turns sharply - as you would expect - and cuts the stumps to splinters.<br>This sort of hocus pocus would have come in handy at the Kotla ground in New Delhi over the past few days. If ever a wicket was made for Warne, this dusty little number was it.<br>But the Victorian's sore finger meant that it was the wizards of India who dominated, turning Australia's reputed world beaters into a team of batting rabbits; prodding and poking with fear at the ball as if spinners Joshi, Kumble (especially) and Kapoor were hurling cobras instead of leather.<br>India is a delight to watch on its home turf - cocky, talented and spirited. But strangely the people of New Delhi don't seem to agree. The crowds at this one-off Test for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have been surprisingly sparse, although thoroughly partisan.<br>Channel 9 has been testing cricket lovers' patience by showing highlights early in the morning. On Saturday it was 12.50am before the cricket emerged from the blur of a movie called Dingo. On Friday the lacklustre sequel to Kung Fu held up play.<br>But what has been shown has been good. Few sights in cricket rival a wristy Indian batsman in attacking mood. Even though the little keeper Nayan Mongia took the honours with a century, it was the uninhibited left hander Saurav Ganguly with 66 who provided the fireworks.<br>Although Australia has a 24-8 (with one tie) record against India, only eight wins have been in India. The last was at Madras in 1969. In New Delhi, Australia has won only once.<br>The lateness of the cricket did allow a solid feast of NBL semi-final action on Channel 10.<br>The Adelaide 36ers lost by a point to the more favoured South East Melbourne Magic. But Adelaide gave it everything. Unlike New Delhi, the crowd at the Clipsal Powerhouse was big and noisy.<br>It must be something in the air in Adelaide - perhaps the remnants of petrol fumes from the departed grand prix - that makes its crowds so spirited.<br>It has gone to the heads of their sportsmen, too. Four of five 36ers on court at one stage had chrome domes, just like the former Adelaide Crow Andrew Jarman and SA shield captain Jamie Siddons.<br>Thankfully, this defoliant does not affect Adelaide women. The victorious SA side in their national netball final, shown on the ABC on Saturday, all had what looked like identical hairstyles; long and tied back.<br>Maybe it's a pre-requisite for netball. The losing Victorians had the same hairstyles, too.<br>The most Australian sport on TV in the past week was shown by SBS, surprisingly. Yesterday it had the Aboriginal rugby league knockout championships from Bourke, in far north-western NSW.<br>The ground was paddock-like and the stands dilapidated in an Australian country town way, but the football was fast and exciting.<br></font></p>
