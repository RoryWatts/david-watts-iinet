            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SEX is on the way out, or maybe it just isn't as big as it's cracked up to be.<br>A recent US Internet survey by the NPD PC-Meter shows that adult sites on the World Wide Web are being visited far less frequently.<br>The NPD PC-Meter is a piece of equipment attached to the computers in 4000 US homes, similar to a TV ratings meter. The latest published survey was for the second quarter of the year.<br>It shows that of the top-50 content-provided sites on the Web - as opposed to search engines and directories - only one, playboy.com, is an adult site.<br>Adult content was visited by 19.4 per cent of the surveyed audience, compared with 25.5 per cent in the previous survey. Woman surfers - up from 31.7 per cent to 38.7 - is believed responsible for the drop.<br>Education sites remain the most visited on the Web (45 per cent). Information, news and entertainment sites, led by Pathfinder and c/net, come second with 41.5 per cent of hits, then adult sites followed by government.<br>URL: www.npd.com<br></font></p>
