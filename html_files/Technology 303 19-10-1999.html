Attempts to access the Government's official Web site at www.pak.gov.pk were greeted with a screen that said: ?The site is temporarily down?.<br>It was still in that state of suspended animation four days after the overthrow of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.<br>But anyone interested in the state of affairs in this troubled, nuclear-powered corner of the world can still find out a lot on the Web.<br>The Pakistan Information Page - dedicated to the ?Land of the Pure? - has a wealth of links to sites about the country. Despite a military takeover and martial law, many of Pakistan's online news sites, accessible from the information page, are reporting openly enough on the situation.<br>The information page also has links to sites about travel, food, language, art and sport.<br>Pakistan People's Party<br>www.ppp.org.pk<br>THIS site is a showcase for Pakistan's most high-profile international personality - outside of cricket circles - Benazir Bhutto. The opposition leader and chairwoman of the PPP was sacked twice as prime minister. Her news releases at this site give guarded praise to the army for overthrowing Mr Sharif.<br>The PPP site provides a detailed look at the ideals that drove her late father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, to found the party.?The age of Bhutto was an Age of Revolution,? says the site which also provides Ms Bhutto's e-mail address.<br>TOURISM<br>Indian Ocean Tourism Organisation<br>www.ioto.org<br>THIS WA-based regional tourism marketing body's site has been awarded the Gold Seal for Superb Reference by the Net publication, ExpoWorld.<br>IOTO is the only WA listing in ExpoWorld's international directory of leading travel, tourism and related industry bodies.<br>Qantas, the WA Tourism Commission, Burswood Resort and Casino and Edith Cowan University are members of IOTO, whose secretariat is now based at the ECU school of tourism at Joondalup.<br>The Web site was designed and is managed by University of WA student Wayne Thompson and is housed on a US server.<br></font></p>
