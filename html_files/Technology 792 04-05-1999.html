            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FEDERAL Communications Minister Richard Alston has failed to acknowledge the growing criticism of his plans to censor the Internet.<br>Last Tuesday Senator Alston said the Government warmly welcomed ?extensive community, industry and political support? for the censorship regime due to come into force on January 1, 2000.<br>The same day The West Australian ran a report in this section pointing out that opposition to the legislation had grown rapidly since the Bill to amend the Broadcasting Services Act had been introduced on April 21. The West Australian also ran a column about the political motives of appeasing Independent Senator Brian Harradine.<br>The Melbourne Age and the Sydney Morning Herald had a report the same day about growing opposition to Senator Alston's plans. It was headlined ?Furore over attack on rights?.<br>And The Australian carried two reports about the legislation. One was under the headline ?Fury at Alston Net Bill?, and said opposition had intensified.<br>The other was a feature called ?See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil, load no evil?. It began: ?Lock up your children! Internet evil abounds! Paedophiles, drug pushers and porn barons are a mouse-click away! And it will take more than a cranky Net Nanny to keep these online pollutants at bay ...?<br>It went on to say that opponents of the legislation were ready to fight.<br>Yet Senator Alston's press release said: ?As newspaper reports have also demonstrated, the proposals enjoy wide support among Australian citizens including younger Australians. It is interesting to note that even the "wired generation' recognises the importance of protecting their younger siblings from this material (X and R-rated) online.?<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia, which is organising protests and a petition against censorship, countered Senator Alston's claim the day after it was made by issuing a press release that ?welcomed extensive community, industry, and political support for its campaign against Internet censorship legislation?.<br>?We particularly welcome statements in the Senate by the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens which show that they have not been hoodwinked by the emotive rhetoric accompanying the Bill,? said EFA executive director Darce Cassidy.<br>The EFA claimed the legislation would place unnecessary burdens on access and content providers and cripple the development of the online economy.<br>The newsgroup aus.censorship has several discussion threads about the legislation. Headings include: Censorship - Alston's hidden agenda; Stop Censorship, and Censorship will increase your ISP bill. None welcome the proposals.<br>Close examination of the more than 100 arguments revealed only two or three people who agreed with the legislation. Most criticise it as unworkable, possibly leading to a more expensive Net and politically motivated to win the vote of Senator Harradine.<br>The Australian Computer Society, which had initially released a statement welcoming Senator Alston's plans, changed tack late last week when a representative appeared before the Senate committee given nine days to examine the legislation.<br>The society's community affairs board director, Andrew Freeman, said that while the Government's objective to protect children from illegal or offensive material was commendable, the extent to which technology could achieve this was limited.<br>?We are concerned that the Government has unrealistic expectations of what the technology could achieve and believe more time should be spent in discussing this issue before a final resolution on the draft legislation is made,? Mr Freeman said.<br>ACS immediate past president Tom Worthington argued against a restrictive regime which he said would do more harm than good.<br>He feared that heavy-handed regulation could harm the educational and employment opportunities of a generation of Australian children.<br></font></p>
