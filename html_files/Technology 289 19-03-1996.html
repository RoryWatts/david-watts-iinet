            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FEAR of Internet regulation has driven Net service providers to cut the amount of obscene material and proved there is a case for government intervention.<br>These claims are made by the Religious Alliance Against Pornography in a public submission to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's online services probe.<br>The alliance's submission, written by its Australian representative Alan Wakeley, is one of few of the more than 150 received that opposes total Net freedom.<br>Mr Wakeley said that since the ABA's probe was announced last August there had been a softening of the ABA stance, changing from concern about perversity to a benign and at times tolerant attitude.<br>?It suggests that those official bodies which have been involved in the inquiries have at last begun to search the Internet itself rather than relying on the views of third parties,? Mr Wakeley's submission said.<br>?However, it also suggests a degree of naivety on the part of the authorities about the way the system works and, indeed, about developments within the Australian Internet community.?<br>There was a mistaken impression that the amount of hard-core material on the Net had dropped.<br>Mr Wakeley had noticed that even some previously accessible hard-core newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.paedophilia had disappeared. Service providers had cut them.<br>But late last year he had visited the US and had been able to view hundreds of hard-core newsgroups.<br>He claimed that Australian providers had done what many submissions to the ABA claimed was not technically feasible. They had monitored and censored their own services.<br>Mr Wakeley also attacked claims that a well publicised 27-hour search of the Net had failed to find hard-core material.<br>?Twenty-seven hours is simply not enough. Nor in fact would 1000 be enough if the Internet service provider through which they are doing their research is restricting access to certain parts of the Net,? his submission said.<br>?Because self-regulation has already begun to happen without any public fanfare, and without the knowledge of regulatory authorities, this has had the effect of leading those authorities to believe that the much touted pornographic plague on the Net simply doesn't exist.<br>?With a little more sophisticated effort, they might realise that it's all still out there and an inquisitive child can still find it with relative ease.?<br>Despite industry claims, it seemed technically feasible to control Net content, and it seemed that was actually taking place.<br></font></p>
