            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Eudora e-mail has always been popular with Internet users. Figures vary but Eudora is thought to be used by up to 10 million people.<br>But the efficient program, whether in Light or Pro versions, is under threat.<br>The blockbuster version four browser packages of Netscape Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer both contain excellent e-mail packages which have borrowed many good points from Eudora and bettered them.<br>Microsoft's Outlook Express and Netscape Messenger have the added ability to be a newsreader and to link almost seamlessly back to their parent Web browsers.<br>They are hard acts to beat but Eudora appears undaunted and has just released a beta version of its next generation called Eudora 4.<br>Eudora 4 looks very much like Eudora 3, the popular heavy-duty e-mail program liked by many network managers. However, it has added many new features under the almost identical user interface.<br>The biggest is, at last, support for HTML-formatted messages, something both MSIE and Netscape have done for more than a year. Eudora 3 has a pretend support for HTML, which tries hard but is irritating.<br>To provide full HTML rendering in Windows 95 and Windows NT, Eudora uses MSIE's engine (either the 3.0 or 4.0 version). The integration is nearly seamless: all messages show up in the standard Eudora windows, with non or lightly formatted messages using Eudora's technology, and with all-HTML messages using the IE engine.The Macintosh version, due soon, will also use the same IE engine.<br>The HTML messaging still needs some work. This is a beta version so there is a way to go yet. When Access sent HTML from Eudora, with its easyWYSIWYG editor, results varied on receipt.<br>Outlook Mail showed the correct text but indicated an attachment for the inserted image even though it had been configured successfully to display attached images in the browser window.<br>Netscape showed the image but the text, which was meant to be Arial, came out as the default Courier.<br>A richly formatted HTML message with an ornate background sent from Outlook was displayed on a plain white background in Eudora 4 although the text was as formatted. The background image ended up in a sub-folder of the Eudora directory.<br>A good advance by Eudora is the adoption of the three-pane view, favoured by Outlook and once by Messenger. It displays message folders along the left, message headers on the top of the screen, and highlighted message contents on the bottom.<br>Eudora 3 requires each message to be double-clicked to be opened.<br>The downside still is that there is no background loading so users cannot open messages until all have been received.<br>The filtering ability of Eudora, which was a groundbreaking highlight in earlier versions, is even better.<br>Filters can be used to route mail from certain people to special folders, to automatically delete mail from known junk mailers, to highlight certain subjects in colour, and so on.<br>Eudora 4 makes it fairly easy to apply filters. Just right-click a message header, and a Make Filter window pops up, with the message's subject, sender, and recipient already filled in.<br>The interface is familiar but greatly improved. There are dozens of window types, some with useful tabs for changing their content. You can easily modify your icon bar and you can create new ones that dock on any side of the screen or float unattached as little windows.<br>One of the big disappointments of the beta is the Address Book. After becoming used to the easy clickability and automation of both Outlook and Messenger, it is a little too labour-intensive to have to enter contact details manually.<br>Overall, Eudora 4 is promising and remains a worthy e-mailer. The big boys have taken away a lot of its gloss though.<br>Eudora Pro 4 is a time-limited beta for Windows 95 and Windows NT. The full Windows version is scheduled for December 8, and the Mac version about a month after.There are no plans for a Windows 3.x version and the slimmed-down Eudora Light will be available as freeware after Eudora Pro ships.<br>Eudora recommends users have MSIE 3 or 4 installed to provide HTML support.<br></font></p>
