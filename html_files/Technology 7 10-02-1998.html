            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Perth now has a true superhighway for all its public transport. Transperth launched an interactive journey planner on the Web last week, claiming it to be a in Australia.<br>Investigations by Access show this to be true, with Transperth offering commuters and tourists the most up-to-date Internet travel facility in the country. The way the journey planner draws together all forms of public transport in the city - buses, trains and ferries - may also be unique in the world.<br>A search on AltaVista using the words ?online journey planner? found similar facilities on the Web in Britain for British Rail and London Underground. But neither offered the range of choice made possible by Transperth combining all modes of transport.<br>Internet users who want to find out how to get somewhere in Perth have to fill in a simple form to activate the planner. Details needed are the address you are leaving from and the address you want to reach. Optional fields to fill in include the time you would like to leave.<br>The addresses entered can be precise, as in from 10 Smith St, Myaree, to 99 South Terrace, Fremantle; or they can be vague, as in Myaree to Fremantle. If users get something wrong, or it does not match records of addresses in the Transperth database, then a help screen will offer either an alternative or a prompt to try a different address or try just a suburb or landmark rather than a street address.<br>The journey planner will usually display five options for getting where you want. These could be directly by rail or bus, or by a combination. If a ferry trip helps, that will be shown too.<br>The highlight of the displayed options is the walking distance from your stop to the address you want to reach.<br>As a silly example, say you wanted to go from Palmerston Street, Mosman Park, to Salvado Street in Cottesloe - about 1km. The journey planner would be able to tell you to walk 930m to Mosman Park train station, catch the train to Victoria Street station (one minute) then walk 970m back to Salvado Street.This accuracy is made possible by highly detailed maps which record all the metro area's street numbers. Linking these maps to Transperth routes and timetables is at the heart of the journey planner.<br>The software that drives the planner is known as IPTIS (for Integrated Public Transport Information System) and was developed in Brisbane by Opcom. The Serco information service, based at the busport in Mount's Bay Road, has used IPTIS to help travellers by phone.<br>Transperth marketing manager Roger Farley said the agency spent $60,000 to modify Serco's database for user-friendliness and placed it on the Web. The aim was to lure more people to public transport by making information easier to find.<br></font></p>
