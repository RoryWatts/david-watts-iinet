            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AN AUSTRALIAN survey of browser use on the World Wide Web confirms that Netscape Navigator is number one by a virtual street.<br>Internet Communications operates a sophisticated Australian-sites-only search engine called Web Wombat which records the type of browser used in every search hit. Between March 19 and May 21 a total of 344,914 hits were made at Wombat.<br>More than 84 per cent, or 291,000, were with Netscape Navigator. The second most preferred browser was Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 which made 25,268 search requests.<br>The text-based browser Lynx followed with 2.1 per cent of hits, then came IBM's Web Explorer with 1.6 per cent, Quarterdeck's Mosaic (0.7 per cent) and NCSA Mosaic (0.6 per cent).<br>The most popular version of Netscape Navigator used was 2.0 (48 per cent) followed by various versions of 1.0 (40 per cent) and then the newly released version 3.0 (1.6 per cent).<br>Web Wombat has been working since May last year. Internet Communications calls it a ?true search engine? like Lycos, Alta Vista or Web Crawler. It runs under the IBM OS/2 operating system and has a database of hundreds of thousands of Australian sites.<br>URL: http://www.intercom.com.au/wombat<br></font></p>
