            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE worst song ever recorded is . . . (fill in your choice in block letters). I am far too thin-skinned to get involved in this debate. Far better just to light the blue touch-paper on the argument and run in the direction of away.<br>We all seem to have a view on what is actually a very contentious subject. Some old fogies may think anything written after Mick Jagger went sort of straight and started exercising is garbage.<br>Others might be outraged at the way rap (surely a C is missing) artists take old songs and do their mindless thump-thump all over them, pretending it is some form of creativity. Such treatment even has one reminiscing for the original version of You Sexy Thing - and that was hardly a masterpiece.<br>What brought the subject of bad songs to mind was not a sudden recollection that there exists somewhere (almost certainly in the southern states of the US) a country ballad with the title: Take Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, Cos I'm Kissing You Goodbye.<br>That could be some sort of anthem for Wee Willy Clinton, no doubt, but what got me thinking about bad songs was a big barbie the other night.<br>It was one of those occasions where it was very hard to hear exactly what the person bailing you up was saying. However, by letting your ears drift, so to speak, it was possible to home in on a variety of conversations . . . creative eavesdropping if you like.<br>I'd taken my ears off a conversation about some trivial topic like the quality of education and picked up out of left field the word Eagle. Ah, footy, I'd like to talk about that, I thought.<br>But when I tuned in more closely, a delicious GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) was trashing the song Eagle Rock by Daddy Cool as the worst she had heard.<br>She dropped a few points on the gorgeous-meter. I like Eagle Rock. It's boppy and nostalgic. But as I said, these are treacherous waters. Immediately, others voiced their opinions and suddenly there were a dozen different worst songs ever.<br>They included anything by Leonard Cohen, Honey by Bobby Goldsboro (a shocker if I say so myself) and Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.<br>AS A relatively mature . . . oh let's face it . . . as a bunch of greying oldies, we had, collectively, heard a lot of music. Whether we knew anything about it was another matter. So I decided to do some research.<br>That is probably a lie. Actually I forgot about it entirely until late the next day when I was browsing through The Guardian newspaper of London.<br>It has a section called Notes & Queries where the meaning of life might be found, or at least argued about.<br>Readers propose questions of great moment, like: What is the origin of the saying ?as thick as two short planks"? Other readers then put in their 20-cents worth, almost always disagreeing with each other in a brouhaha of self-opinion.<br>This section just happened to pose the question: Apart from Summer Holiday, which is the worst song ever recorded?<br>There was a vote for Ebony and Ivory by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder on the grounds it was ?a magnificent advancement of racial harmony wrapped up in the most sickeningly platitudinous tones?.<br>Tiny Tim's Tiptoe Through The Tulips copped it, as did Long-Haired Lover From Liverpool by Jimmy Osmond.<br>Another McCartney song was mentioned, though the author didn't know the title. He said it included the unforgettable lyrics: I know I was a crazy fool/for treating you the way I did/but something took a hold of me/and I acted like a dustbin lid.<br>Even John Lennon, a saint to many, was harangued for Give Peace a Chance, as was Don McLean for American Pie.<br>After reading all that I came to the conclusion that it's far safer to talk about the republic, or euthanasia or federal grants. Musical memories are just too important.<br></font></p>
