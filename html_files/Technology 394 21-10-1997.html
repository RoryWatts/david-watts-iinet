            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It always pays to read the manual, the readme.txt and/or click the help button. I know it sounds such a bore. Real computer users don't cry for help, do they?<br>A lovely man called Harold Jackson helped computerise the Guardian newspaper in London. One day when he and I had tried and failed a dozen times to get a piece of packet-switching gear to work, he moaned: ?Oh I guess I'll have to look at the bloody manual. Where is it??<br>Like any manual he had anything to with, it was still neatly packaged in its plastic wrap ? at the top of a pile of unread documents on how to assemble PCs, modems, networks and how to write vital software.<br>The same man prided himself on always having one screw left over when he re-assembled a PC.<br>That was seven or eight years ago when it was thought almost sinful to have a 25Mhz processor, 640K of RAM, a 1200Kbps modem and a 10Mb hard disk. In fact, I used to warn reporters off buying laptops with 20Mb disks on the grounds they would never go anywhere near using that space.<br>That was long before Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 was even a gleam behind Bill Gates' nerdy glasses.<br>Since the beginning of the month, millions have beavered away downloading the monster piece of software. Depending on the version, they are grabbing between 16 and 24Mb, most often at 28.8Kbps, and taking a good couple of hours before gobbling up 30 to 50Mb of disk space.<br>How times change. But the sophisticated way MSIE 4.0 tampers with the operating system means it should be mandatory to read the documentation.<br>It is there in a file called ie4.txt which should be among those that travelled into the directory where you set up MSIE 4.0.<br>This is a big text file but its contents may explain why the radical new browser suite may cause you grief.<br>Those who like to carry out online transactions with Microsoft Money 97 will suddenly find they are stranded. MSIE 4.0 has a new component that means an update is necessary from an MS Web site.<br>Users of the popular IBM Aptiva PC will find that the Access Aptiva component will not work properly with MSIE 4.0. MS's suggested solution is to contact the Aptiva home page at IBM to obtain an updated version of the program.<br>All those who like to rely on Norton Utilities and Norton Navigator have some worries too. Norton Utilities version 2.0 is not compatible with the IE4 recycle bin. If you run Norton Navigator, the Control Panel shortcuts on the Start menu do not work.<br>Users need to disable the Norton Taskbar feature to use the IE taskbar.<br>The documentation warns that one of the most useful plug-ins available on the Web, the Adobe Acrobat version 3 PDF viewer, may not work. It suggests users download the latest version from Adobe.<br>CleanSweep can be a helpful utility for cleaning out unwanted junk but MS warns not to install it if you have IE 4.0 running. CleanSweep replaces vital system files which will disrupt both Explorer and the Active Desktop.<br>There are several other warnings, including ones on NetMeeting, Telcom Fax and the Procomm Plus 95 browser.<br>A good browse of the ie4.txt documentation should alert users to the most common potential problems. It also has handy information on proxies and firewalls as well as installing on a network.<br>It all may sound as if MSIE 4.0 is a bit of a disaster but, of course, it isn't. There are workarounds, advice or updates for most problems and conflicts with other programs. MSIE 4.0 has such a profound effect on the entire operating system that more annoyances are bound to surface.<br>Just don't forget to read the documentation.<br>Next week in Access: More on IE4.0<br></font></p>
