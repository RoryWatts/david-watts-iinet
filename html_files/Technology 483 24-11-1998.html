            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FORMER journalist Kim Murray is a wired man ... and thanks to his passion for the World Wide Web, so is Margaret River.<br>Mr Murray, 52, has been creating simple, professional sites for more than two years. His latest venture, Margaret River Online, puts the tourist and wine-growing region firmly on the cyber map.<br>MRO is a portal site that takes three of Mr Murray's former sites and combines them as a virtual doorway to the Margaret River area.<br>It presents news, both local and West Australian, information on attractions in the area, local contacts and opportunities for businesses to send their messages out on the Web.<br>MRO was launched at the recent Margaret River and District Agricultural Show. Mr Murray took his computer to the show and says the site attracted much interest.<br>He booked about a dozen businesses at the show and says he is getting about one call a day from people who have decided to have a go.<br>?Word of mouth in a country town is wonderful. I sometimes wonder why I owned a newspaper (the Augusta-Margaret River Mail),? he said last week.<br>MRO aims to give businesses a first experience of the Web, cheaply and easily.<br>This would help counter some misconceptions about the medium that Mr Murray has found.<br>?Some people thought you had to own a computer and leave it on 24 hours a day to have a Web page,? he said.<br>?MRO allows businesses to have an Internet presence without any hassles. We create the pages and keep them current.<br>?Because download times are not like city times the pages are kept simple. Much of the site is text-based because of this.? Overseas interest in MRO is guaranteed already. Mr Murray's West Australian News Review site - begun partly to satisfy the news appetite of expatriate West Australians - is prominently positioned at the MRO portal.<br>Mr Murray says he has about 1000 regular readers of the Review, many from overseas.<br>?I also find myself dishing out a lot of travel advice to people from overseas who are coming here on holidays They are attracted by the Cruising the Cape site (another of the sites incorporated into MRO),? he said.<br>He wants MRO to entertain and inform the locals and also inform people outside the town of what it has to offer.<br>The decision to create a portal site, rather than continue with several different ones, was partly influenced by the nature of the Web itself.<br>Mr Murray echoed the opinion of many Web users when he spoke of the difficulty of finding appropriate information using search engines.<br>?I thought that if the town joined a hub site then people would be better served,? he said.<br>?I was encouraged to continue by the Federal Government's Internet Summit in Bunbury several months ago at which speakers urged the establishment of town portals.<br>?The thrust of the travelling cyber circus was to encourage businesses to get a simple online presence, feel the experience and grow with it.?<br>Mr Murray is a Mac user. He works on his sites with the Adobe Pagemill HTML editor, the Netscape Navigator 3.0 Gold editor and ?good, old Simpletext?.<br>Margaret River Online is at www.margaret-river-online.<br>com.au<br></font></p>
