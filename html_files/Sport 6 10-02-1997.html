            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE might say something is as easy as falling off a bicycle, but few sports are harder on the body and mind than cycling, whether it be on the track or road.<br>Training rides of more than 50km are so regular as to be boringly routine. Strict diets and discipline are natural parts of a racing cyclist's life.<br>Encyclopedia Britannica records that cycling as a sport began with a 1200m race in Saint-Cloud Park near Paris on May 31, 1868. The first English race was held the next day at Hendon, Middlesex.<br>Racing on tracks started to become common about 1871. The National Cyclists Union was founded in 1878 and led a movement to form the International Cyclist Association (ICA; 1892). Founding members were Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the US and Canada.<br>The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) was founded in 1900 because of a feeling that there was undue British influence in the ICA. Great Britain joined the UCI a few years later and it is now the main body controlling professional road racing.<br>The development of racing as a popular summer spectator sport in much of Europe began in the 1890s with the now-classic Bordeaux-Paris, Paris-Roubaix, and Liege-<br>Bastogne-Liege races held annually except in wartime.<br>In 1903 the first Tour de France, the premier classic road race, was held.<br>In England a ban on road racing created a special kind of racing, the time trial, intended to circumvent the law, in which racers started one at a time, raced over a fixed distance, and tried to make the fastest time.<br>Road and track races for men were held at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. Women entered Olympic competition in road races from 1984 and track races from 1988. Mountain biking, a cross-country race over rough terrain, became an Olympic event for men and women at the 1996 Games.<br>Professional cyclists were not allowed to compete in the Olympic Games until 1996.<br>Racing types<br>¦ The Sprint: A battle of wits, nerve power and speed. Each race is three laps, but quite often the cyclists are flat out for a little over 200 metres. Only the last 200m is timed.<br>Riders jockey for position in a cat and mouse game, each waiting for just the right moment to make their move and watching constantly to ensure their opponent does not take them by suprise.<br>¦ Time Trial: The 1000m time trial usually referred to as the ?KILO?. It requires a supreme effort by the cyclist racing against the clock. From a standing start each cyclist must reach top speed as soon as possible and then maintain that for the remainder of the 1000m.<br>¦ Individual Pursuit: Two riders start at opposite sides of the track. If a rider catches his opponent, he wins. This happens rarely in top competition, so the winner is the first one to cover the race distance.<br>¦ Team Pursuit: Arguably one of the most exciting spectator events, it is a contest between four-man teams. Riders must keep as close together as possible to reduce wind resistance to an absolute minimum for the riders behind the leader.<br>Riders change position with precision and the clock is stopped when the third team member crosses the finishing line.<br>¦ Points race: A race in which there are many sprints at designated stages. Riders are awarded points for their positions in each sprint. Anyone who laps the field is automatically ahead even if he has fewer points.<br>Our medals<br>AUSTRALIANS have an excellent record at the Olympic Games and can always be counted on to be among the top cycling nations.<br>Of a total of 25 Olympic cycling medals, six have been gold, 11 silver and eight bronze. Men have won 21 and women four, but women's cycling arrived only in 1984.<br>Gold medal winners:<br>¦ Dunc Gray, 1000m time trial, Los Angeles 1932.<br>¦ Lionel Cox and Russell Mockridge, 2000m tandem, Helsinki 1952<br>¦ Russell Mockridge, 1000m individual pursuit, Helsinki 1952<br>¦ Anthony Marchant and Ian Browne, 2000m tandem, Melbourne 1956<br>¦ Kevin Nicholls, Michael Turtur, Dean Woods, Michael Grenda, 4000m team pursuit, Los Angeles 1984<br>¦ Kathy Watt, Individual road race, Barcelona 1992.<br>Recent highlights<br>¦ 1988: At the Seoul Olympics, Dean Woods won silver and bronze medals, and Gary Neiwand won a bronze in the sprint. The pursuit team won a bronze. Australia was rated the second track cycling country in the world.<br>¦ 1990: At the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, track cyclists won four gold, four silver, two bronze medals and had three fourth placings. The men's track cycling team was the top men's track cycling team in the Commonwealth for the third time running. Steve McGlede won the 50km points race at the World Championships and the pursuit team won a bronze. At the Goodwill Games the men's track team won a silver, a bronze and a fourth placing. AIS head coach Charlie Walsh was awarded the status of ?World Coach? by the World governing body of cycling.<br>¦ 1991: At the World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, Steve McGlede won silver in the 50km points, Gary Neiwand won bronze in the sprint, and the pursuit team won bronze.<br>¦ 1992: At the Barcelona Olympics Kathy Watt won both a gold and a silver medal. Shane Kelly won a silver, Gary Neiwand a silver, and Brett Aitken, Steve McGlede, Shaun O'Brien and Stuart O'Grady broke the world record on their way to winning their team silver medal. Mark Kingsland broke the world record on his way to a fourth placing in the individual pursuit.<br>¦ 1993: The men's team at the World Championships achieved the best results in track cycling in the 100 year history of the World Track Championships. Gary Neiwand won gold in the sprint and the Keirin; Brett Aitken, Stuart O'Grady, Tim O'Shannessey and Billy-Joe Shearsby shattered the world record when winning the gold medal in the team pursuit; Shane Kelly won a silver medal in the ?Kilo?.<br>¦ 1994: At the 1994 World Cycling Championships, WA sprinter Darryn Hill won a silver medal, while Shane Kelly won bronze in the 1000m individual time trial. Australian cyclists won gold medals in six events including the 4000m teams pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, setting Commonwealth records in four of these events. They also won three silver and four bronze.<br>¦ 1995: At the World Championships in Colombia, Australia won three gold and two bronze medals. Shane Kelly set a world record in the 1km time trial.<br>¦ 1996: Australia won a silver and four bronze medals at the Atlanta Olympics. Only France, Italy and Canada won as many or more.<br>1997 route for the Tour de France<br>¦ The 1997 Tour de France - the 84th - starts in Rouen on Saturday, July 5, and finishes after 3,870 kilometres in Paris on Sunday July 27.<br>¦ It will include two Individual Time-Trials and two stages in Switzerland.<br>Back to basics<br>THE 1997 Tour de France, starting in Rouen in honour of the late five-time winner Jacques Anquetil, returns to its roots with an almost entirely French itinerary this year.<br>Rouen, birthplace of Anquetil, will mark the 10th anniversary of the great Frenchman's death and 40th anniversary of his first Tour triumph in 1957 with the prologue on July 5.<br>The 1997 Tour will then head down the western side of France, including Brittany which missed out this year, embarking on an anti-clockwise reverse swing to the 1996 race won by Dane Bjarne Rijs.<br>There are just two individual time trials apart from the prologue, the first over 55 km at St Etienne - the 12th stage on July 18 after the only rest day and before the tough climb to Alpe d'Huez.<br>There is a second on the penultimate stage, like this year, over 62 km at Disneyland before the traditional run-in to the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 27.<br>Five of the opening seven stages are longer than 200 km as the Tour makes for Bordeaux and the traditional crossing of the Landes before hitting the Pyrenees ahead of the Alps.<br>The ninth stage on July 14 includes the rugged mountain passes of Soulor, Tourmalet, Aspin et Val-Louron.<br>The next day the riders hit the highest point in the Tour at Envalira - 2407 metres - and then head for Andorra-Arcalis, first of three uphill finishes.<br>The others are at Alpe d'Huez - left out of the 1996 race - in the 13th stage and the new climb to Courchevel in stage 14.<br>The 16th stage takes the riders into the Swiss town of Fribourg with the return into France through the Alsace and the 19th stage which ends at Dijon, another traditional tour stop.<br>Sources of statistics and information:<br>http://www.velonews.com/races/races.html (VeloNews Interactive)<br>http://sports.eb.com/olympic/micro/<br>5/55.html (Encyclopedia Britannica guide to cycling)<br>http://www.ausport.gov.au/cycling/cyclink.html (Australian Institute of Sport)<br>Golf<br>World rankings<br>1 Greg Norman (Australia)<br>12.26 points average<br>2 Tom Lehman 10.04<br>3 Colin Montgomerie (Scot) 8.95<br>4 Ernie Els (S Afr) 8.90<br>5 Mark O'Meara 8.04<br>6 Nick Faldo (Eng) 7.89<br>7 Fred Couples 7.67<br>8 Masashi Ozaki (Jap) 7.58<br>9 Davis Love III 7.38<br>10 Corey Pavin 6.94<br>11 Phil Mickelson 6.80<br>12 Nick Price (Zim) 6.28<br>13 Steve Stricker 6.19<br>14 Tiger Woods 5.72<br>15 Scott Hoch 5.69<br>16 Steve Elkington (Australia) 5.61<br>17 Mark McNulty (Zim) 5.53<br>18 Bernhard Langer (Ger) 5.49<br>19 David Duval 5.42<br>20 Tom Watson 5.35<br>Tennis<br>Men's rankings<br>1 Pete Sampras (US) 5,774 points<br>2 Goran Ivanisevic (Cro) 3,562<br>3 Thomas Muster (Aus) 3,492<br>4 Michael Chang (US) 3,417<br>5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov (Rus) 3,367<br>6 Richard Krajicek (Neth) 2,371<br>7 Marcelo Rios (Ch) 2,329<br>8 Wayne Ferreira (S Afr) 2,221<br>9 Carlos Moya (Spa) 2,171<br>10 Thomas Enqvist (Swe) 2,104<br>11 Alberto Costa (Spa) 2,036<br>12 Andre Agassi (US) 1,948<br>13 Boris Becker (Ger) 1,931<br>14 Todd Martin (US) 1,840<br>15 Felix Mantilla (Spa) 1,688<br>16 Stefan Edberg (Swe) 1,561<br>17 Tim Henman (Bri) 1,540<br>18 Magnus Gustafsson (Swe) 1,537<br>19 Michael Stich (Ger) 1,516<br>20 Alberto Berasategui (Spa) 1,477<br>Australians: 29 Jason Stoltenberg 1,204, 32 Todd Woodbridge 1,127, 37 Mark Philippoussis 1,061, 45 Mark Woodforde 879, 52 Sandon Stolle 799, 64 Patrick Rafter 741, 78 Scott Draper 624, 87 Richard Fromberg 575, 185 Ben Ellwood 225, 191 Michael Tebbutt 217, 192 James Sekulov 214.<br>World's best cyclists<br>The top 10 cyclists, according to UCI are arrived at from results of major road races, like the Tour de France (principally in Europe)<br>The rankings<br>1 Laurent Jalabert (Fra)<br>2 Alex Zulle (Swi)<br>3 Bjarne Riis (Den)<br>4 Johan Museeuw (Bel)<br>5 Michele Bartoli (Ita)<br>6 Abraham Olano (Spa)<br>7 Richard Virenque (Fra)<br>8 Toni Rominger (Swi)<br>9 Lance Armstrong (US)<br>10 Francesco Casagrande (Ita)<br>Highest ranked Australian:<br>73 Patrick Jonker.<br>World Cup winners<br>1989 Sean Kelly (Ire)<br>1990 Gianni Bugno (Ita)<br>1991 Maurizio Fondriest (Ita)<br>1992 Olaf Ludwig (Ger)<br>1993 Maurizio Fondriest (Ita)<br>1994 Gianluca Bortolami (Ita)<br>1995 Johan Museeuw (Bel)<br>1996 Johan Museeuw (Bel)<br></font></p>
