            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LOVE is one four-letter word rarely uttered when talking about sport on TV.<br>Yet examples of love - or at least love affairs - are easy to find in nearly every contest on the box.<br>Last Friday night, Channel 7's mega-mouth Bruce McAvaney returned to the football fray. He was able to throw off the red-and-white Nagano Winter Olympics jumper to commentate on a sport that seems closer to his heart than ice skating.<br>And it was little surprise that one of the combatants was North Melbourne, who looked awesome - to use a McAvaney phrase - in dumping Brisbane out of the Ansett Cup.<br>Many football lovers find McAvaney a shade too enthusiastic toward the Roos, in particular their champion centre half forward Wayne Carey.<br>On Friday the game was only halfway into the first quarter when Carey performed some of his trademark bullocking work around the packs 50 metres from goal.<br>?Oh Carey ... clever,? said McAvaney. And then, seconds later: ?Carey ... beautiful.? Make no mistake, Carey is good, although we in WA, particularly Eagles supporters, have rarely seen the best of him live because he is nearly always taken to the cleaners by Glen Jakovich.<br>But he wears the champion tag well. And when McAvaney is calling the game he wears it a lot.<br>He is not the only commentator who appears to have a verbal love affair with a particular sportsman, or club; not by a long shot.<br>Kevin Bartlett cannot seem to wait for Jeff Farmer of Melbourne, or Winston Abraham, now of North, to get near the ball. Both are ?wizards? to KB.<br>Dennis Cometti just loves a Peter Matera run out of defence.<br>Drew Morphett seems to become all emotional when Mick Martyn, of North, is in picture.<br>Sandy Roberts reserves his loudest yelps of excitement for Tony Liberatore of the Bulldogs.<br>On the Footy Show, Eddie McGuire could talk the hind leg off a duck about Collingwood, and does at times to the detriment of the show.<br>Sam Newman seems to have a love affair with controversy, lashing out regularly at South Australians, Tasmanians and illiterate letter writers from ?the shallow end of the gene pool?.<br>Yet last Thursday he was obviously sincere about a true love - the Geelong jumper he wore so well in more than 300 games.<br>Cats captain Barry Stoneham modelled the club's new Adidas-backed away-strip on the show. Newman could not contain his disappointment that one of the league's most recognisable uniforms had been transformed into something far too close to the navy blue colours of Carlton.<br>Newman, quite rightly, was critical of the trend toward radically altered jumpers for sponsorship's sake - a trend that can just about ruin an old love affair between supporters and their clubs.<br></font></p>
