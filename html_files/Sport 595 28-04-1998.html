            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF OWNERS resemble their dogs, do AFL teams resemble their coaches?<br>Fremantle provided the most tangible evidence of what might seem a cock-eyed theory on Saturday night.<br>There were smiles all round when Docker Andrew Wills soccered through the amazing goal that sealed a 17-point win over heavyweight North Melbourne.<br>Wills then imitated an English soccer player by pretending to be a jet as he saluted gleeful fans.<br>Coach Gerard Neesham beamed the goofiest of wide smiles.<br>One gets the feeling that Neesham is a happy, light-hearted sort of bloke, who can show stern resolve when the chips are down.<br>His team plays a happy, light brand of football that is about the most entertaining in the league ... when it goes right. And it has gone right for two weeks in a row.<br>The stern resolve that Neesham has possessed through some hard times - noticeably after the Adelaide debacle - has obviously seeped through to the players, judging by the way they parried the North assault in the final quarter on Saturday.<br>A physical toughness - which first came to light when Jess Sinclair leapt at John Worsfold in the western derby - also is evident.<br>And the Dockers' brand of speed, mixed with what is starting to look like the right dose of eccentricity, makes Saturday night TV something worth staying home for.<br>Do yourself a favour and throw out the social calendar for this Saturday night's clash with Port Adelaide.<br>Port coach John Cahill is different from Neesham. Where Neesham is mostly a smiler, Cahill is a frowner. One senses that where Neesham allows players a bit of freedom to experiment, Cahill is an old-fashioned headmaster, demanding his boys do it for the club, the city, the State and then themselves.<br>What of the other teams and their coaches?<br>West Coast is, of course, as dour and determined as Mick Malthouse. After the first two rounds you would have added that the Eagles had inspired attacking moments of rare genius as well. Knowing Malthouse's record, that flair is bound to return soon, along with those famous silky skills.<br>Ken Judge knows his footy, but is a worrier. Any wonder that Hawthorn, an attacking young team, worried itself out of so many games until the landmark win over Brisbane on Saturday?<br>Terry Wallace is a ferocious competitor, seemingly able to frighten the average bloke like Danny Southern to stellar performances. Should we have been surprised that his Western Bulldogs kicked eight goals in the last quarter, almost toppling Rodney Eade's cocky Swans - who themselves are just clones of the fast, no-nonsense Rocket?<br>David Parkin and Carlton? Well-heeled, well-dressed, but the best days are behind them.<br>Tony Shaw and Collingwood? Total surprises, probably even to themselves.<br>Kevin Sheedy and Essendon? Over-confident, over-exposed and lacking the killer touch.<br>John Northey and Brisbane? Real worries.<br>Similar parallels also can be found for Malcolm Blight, Gary Ayres, Denis Pagan, Geoff Gieschen, Neale Daniher and Stan Alves.<br>But - in the words of John Russo - I've had no prior opportunity to dispose of them.<br></font></p>
