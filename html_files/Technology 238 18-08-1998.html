            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web can be a frustrating place. Slow downloads, links that no longer exist and unexpected disconnections can conspire to ruin a planned afternoon of browsing.<br>Such upsets are beyond a joke when you have business to do.<br>Last Saturday I had a perfect connection, fast uploads and some uninterrupted sessions. But I had a web site that refused to cooperate. And it was one where I - and millions of others - expect no fuss.<br>The Windows Update site is central to Microsoft's policy of integrating the web with its operating systems.<br>If you have Internet Explorer 4.0 or Windows 98, you can simply click on the product update button and the web site will interrogate your PC down the phone line, suggest the programs you need, then deliver and install them.<br>But on Saturday the site would not play ball. I wanted to update to the much hyped new version of Microsoft's Media Player, which, controversially, intrudes on some other media players provided by non-Microsoft companies, notably the Winamp MPEG3 player and the RealPlayer.<br>But instead of a smooth and automatic installation, I received a vague message saying ?Control Required?.<br>Sometimes my self-control is a bit iffy, particularly in matters concerning Pauline Hanson or AFL umpires.<br>But not on Saturday. I was in control. Microsoft didn't believe me, however.<br>The warning suggested I ensure the preferences for the IE4 browser were set to medium security. They were, in fact they have never changed and I have used the update site successfully in the past.<br>Repeated retries all failed miserably, generating the same ?Control Required? warning, and refusing to allow me to click on any other meaningful link.<br>Later today, even more will be offered at this site. News.com has reported that Microsoft is releasing its first update to Windows 98, but is calling it a ?multimedia update? rather than an upgrade or bug fix.<br>Questions have been raised about whether Microsoft released Windows 98 on June 25 despite knowledge of technical problems in a rush to meet shipping deadlines.<br>The OS has copped a reasonable amount of flak - though nowhere as much as its predecessor - mainly because of problematic upgrades on older machines and spotty recognition of peripheral devices such as printers.<br>About 75 per cent of the correspondence I have seen from users, and my own experience, suggests Windows 98 is a good upgrade on the right system, offering much more stability and even better performance.<br>But the gainsayers - who represent a fairly big minority - often have horror stories about PCs that refuse to boot, scanners and printers that will not work and plagues of shutdowns.<br>It hardly seems like the same OS. But given the incredible variety of PC platforms and uses that people demand, it actually is not surprising that one Windows OS cannot satisfy everybody. (and I am talking only of home users).<br>The broad base of expectations becomes broader as new and more applications enter the fray. I have read a lot of e-mails attacking Windows by using the analogy of the car industry.<br>Critics say Microsoft is like a dealer who sells you a new car with no wheels.<br>When you protest, the dealer says the wheels will be on version 2.0 or an upgrade patch.<br>But cars are much more like each other than PCs. And PC users can do hundreds of different things with one given PC.<br>Car users tend to just drive, maybe on different surfaces, but the basics are better defined.<br>Again, Microsoft's very size and dominance is proving to be a weak link.<br>It cannot possibly satisfy such a big customer base with such diverse needs with one product. The more it tries, the more it will resort to updates and patches. And if its update site plays up, is it any wonder that users will continue to set up excellent resources like the Windows 98 Annoyances site.<br>At least you can have a good grumble rather than watching a Microsoft warning cloud your day.<br>Users who land at this resourceful site can learn dozens of ways to improve their Windows 98 set-up from suggestions sent in by fellow Netizens.<br>They can also send in their own complaints, helpful tips and even funny stories about Windows.<br>It seems that cooperation is the best way to tackle a monster.<br>Help Desk<br>Windows Update:<br>windowsupdate.<br>microsoft.com<br>News.com report:<br>www.news.com/News/Item/<br>0,4,25055,00.html<br>Windows 98 Annoyances:<br>www.annoyances.org/win98/<br></font></p>
