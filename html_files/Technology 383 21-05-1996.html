            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAD to happen. With the global Internet population snaking towards 40 million and a new World Wide Web page appearing every four seconds, addiction is starting to become a serious problem.<br>A recent small survey of Net users by a University of Buffalo (New York) student suggests 20 per cent are exhibiting addictive behaviour.<br>Survey author Viktor Brenner, a doctoral student, likens Net addiction to pathological gambling. He rates people who spend more than 40 hours a week hooked to the Net as probably addicts.<br>Mr Brenner's survey group was asked how much the Net interfered with other daily activities such as socialising, gardening, parenting and work.<br>Mr Brenner said 89 per cent of the group showed addictive behaviour at some stage and 17 per cent all the time. But there is hope for those who do not want to be addicted.<br>The Netanon site in the US offers users up to 10 screens of the warning signs of addiction before offering a possible cure. There are more than 1000 ways to tell if you are addicted. They seem all valid because they have been submitted by Net users from around the world.<br>They include:<br>?You communicate with people on other continents more than you communicate with your neighbours.<br>?Your computer costs more than your car.<br>?You introduce your wife as ?my service provider?.<br>?You tell the children they can't go on the computer because daddy's busy ... and you haven't got a job.<br>After scrolling through masses of addiction signs the Netanon browser is given the cure: ?turn off your computer now and go outside for fresh air!?<br></font></p>
