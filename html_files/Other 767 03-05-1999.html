            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ADVERSITY does bring people together, after all. The thought crossed my mind as the firefighters reeled in their hoses and drove their bright red juggernaut away through the festive gathering of small children, dogs and ice-cream vans attracted by the bonding event.<br>It left a warm glow. And another thought: ?Bugger, why do old adages always have to be true?? Especially when it comes to neighbours. Imbue them with togetherness and who knows what misery ensues.<br>There's neighbourliness and there's soapie-style, talk-it-through mushiness with everybody enmeshed in each other's money troubles, bunions and love life. But inmates whose only connection is being forced by a cruel and uncaring society to hang their hats in the same street should keep their relationships within decorum. A nod of recognition; a murmured pleasantry about the grandness of the day; the odd hand pushing a flat-batteried car to get it started. That's quite enough. As it happens, we've drawn as bonny a bunch of neighbours you could wish for. (Well, you have to say that, don't you?)<br>Seriously, though, no complaints worth mentioning. Apart from the kid who thinks scorching the tyres on his window-rattling mobile boom-box is the only way to drive. And the workshop fanatic's insatiable search for louder power tools. The penetrating boing of basketball on concrete could be less prevalent. As could the ritual farewell honk by visitors; what's their game? A car-horn fetish or excitement at being invited?<br>Then there's the insomniac who practises darts on his veranda at 3am; plonk, plonk, plonk, go the arrows; crunch, crunch, crunch go his footsteps to the dartboard; ditto as he paces back to the throwing mark; then, plonk, plonk, plonk . . .<br>As I said, no major trauma. Arms-length harmony is the way. Only when neighbours get too close do they inspire stand-up comedy routines, horror movies, nervous breakdowns and civil court hearings.<br>TROUBLE starts with real estate agents flogging houses. Gushing about views, location and access to golf - and not a word about the neighbours. What's needed is a compatibility guide. Without it, you discover too late the adjacent house is inhabited by a roof restorer constantly wanting to treat your tiles, or an estate agent who pops round daily to do a valuation.<br>If the people at the back are black-magic cultists prone to running around naked and chanting, it's best to know in advance. So you can react with composure to sacrificial chicken blood on your stucco.<br>Another root of the feuding neighbours syndrome is gardening. It engenders class distinction. At the top are horticultural honchos who can name every plant and hire retrenched public servants who have bought garden-service franchises with their payouts. At the bottom are philistines who regard any greenery they manage to grow merely as a privacy screen. The lawn mafia pointedly leave aerating rollers on our brown wasteland. So to this adversarial blaze that had a whole bunch of neighbours linking arms and singing You'll Never Walk Alone through tears of emotion and smoke aggravation.<br>To be frank, it wasn't exactly one of your ?hundreds flee homes with pillars of smoke visible 30 kilometres away? bushfires. More like one bush on fire. A sprawling thing of indeterminate breed next door, which has opened a branch on our side of the fence. It became a burning bush during the pruning frenzy which strikes whenever a council collection is due. Apparently Mr Next Door's tidying up measures ignited some debris. Within moments, adjoining neighbours were spraying the conflagration with garden hoses.<br>By the time flashing lights and wailing sirens brought the professionals to the seat of the fire, these neighbours had been transformed from distantly polite acquaintances to a close-knit, mutually obligated team.<br>They've already got together again to ?talk it through?. Friendly banter on whose hose has the most effective water-pressure. Advice on removing scorch marks. Donating cuttings to replenish the bush. My wife has even learnt its Latin name.<br>The real adversity has only just begun.<br></font></p>
