            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I TURNED 45 recently. Can't remember exactly when. That is one of the benefits of middle-aged foggiedom . . . you don't have to worry about precise ages, or whatever it is I was talking about.<br>There are many benefits to being 45. For a start, when young men yell ?you're a bald, fat, old git? at you as you walk down the street, you can just look them in the eyes and smile.<br>This is because not only are you a bald, fat, old git; it is because you are also a deaf, bald, fat, old git.<br>When a teenager comes up and asks what you think of her latest Green Day CD, you can hold her gaze and exclaim: ?Sorry I missed that because of the noise of that junk coming from the stereo. Put on this Bee Gees album, would you love? And turn the volume down a bit.?<br>If you go to a gymnasium or a swimming pool, you don't have to pretend you are there to improve your physique. Everyone there will agree with you that it is many kilos and wrinkles beyond hope.<br>And they will know the truth - you have just come to look at the gorgeous young women in their lycra.<br>If the song running around in your head goes ?Monday night, we're Talking Footy?, you won't have to be the tiniest bit embarrassed. For a start, you know that no one will ever ask because they couldn't care less.<br>Even if they do, they probably wouldn't be at all surprised.<br>On weekends, when everyone else under 45 is out having a real life, you can be comfortable in the knowledge that they won't be upset that you have decided to curl up on the sofa with a bottle of red while yelling at the football.<br>They won't be upset because they've forgotten who you are anyway.<br>You won't disappoint your children when they ask you for money, because even they realise that by 45 no one has a brass razoo . . . unless they're on TV.<br>I did a lot of research about turning 45 so I could alert readers about the benefits. I logged on to the Internet and typed the words ?45th birthday? into a search engine, guessing that with 800 million Web pages of information supplied by more than 100 million people, someone, somewhere would have something wise to say about being 45; something wise I could share with you.<br>What I found was the same joke repeated on more than 50 different pages. It is entitled ?Why I sacked my secretary on my 45th birthday?, and goes like this: ?On my 45th birthday I wasn't feeling too hot. At breakfast my wife didn't say anything about my birthday, let alone give me a present.<br>?I thought the children would certainly remember and smother me with birthday kisses and gifts. But not a word.<br>?However, when I walked into my office, my secretary said, "Good morning, boss, happy birthday', and I felt a bit better. About noon my secretary said: "It's such a beautiful day and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch'.<br>?So we went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said: "It's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office. Let's go by my place and I will fix you another martini'.<br>?So we went to her place, we enjoyed another martini and she said: "Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable'. I didn't mind at all.<br>?About six minutes later she came out of the bedroom . . . carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife and children. All were singing Happy Birthday. ?And there I sat . . . with nothing on except my socks.?<br>Forty-five. It's a tough age.<br></font></p>
