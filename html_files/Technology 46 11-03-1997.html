            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT is juggling its way through one of the busiest times seen on the World Wide Web browser front.<br>The Seattle software giant announced late last week that it was on the verge of releasing a preview version of Internet Explorer 4.0, which publicity suggests follows Netscape Communicator's policy of integrating Internet activities into one suite of programs.<br>In the same breath as its MSIE 4.0 announcement, Microsoft released patches to plug what could be serious breaches of the MSIE 3.x line of browsers for Windows95 and Windows NT.<br>At this stage it is possible only to take Microsoft's word for it, and MSIE 4.0 looks more of an integrated suite than Communicator.<br>Microsoft has released screengrabs of what MSIE 4.0 should look like and they show an uncanny similarity to a Win95 desktop, right down to a start button for Net functions.<br>At its Explorer site on the Web, Microsoft says: ?The Internet now becomes a seamless part of your desktop operating system, with the browser and browser-like navigation available in every Windows view. Second, Internet Explorer 4.0 delivers tight integration across its suite of products. That means consistency - including a common toolbar - across all the applications and an easy way to switch between tools.?<br>What Microsoft says it has is basically; the familiar Explorer browser, Outlook Express e-mail and newsgroup centre, NetMeeting conferencing tool, NetShow multimedia application and FrontPad, a WYSIWYG HTML editor.<br>All in all it is very much the same as Netscape has delivered already with Communicator. The main difference will be in the desktop packaging.<br>The second preview release (or second beta to remove the gift-wrapping) of Communicator was made available a fortnight ago. It is bigger, better and certainly less buggy than the first beta released around Christmas.<br>It is now also available for Windows3.1, Macintosh and some Unix platforms.<br>The battle between the browsers appears to be building up again. But in the meantime, Microsoft is encouraging Win95 and NT users of MSIE 3.0 and 3.1 to download the patch that it says will plug a potentially serious hole in the browser.<br>The security hole allows a hacker to delete files from a user's computer. Microsoft said a trio of students discovered the Explorer security hole while working on a school project. The students were able to remotely create and delete folders on other people's PCs by using .url and .lnk files, also known as the Shortcuts feature of Win95 and NT.<br>Microsoft officials stressed that the company knew of no one who had been victimised by hackers exploiting the security hole.<br>URLs<br>MSIE latest (patch and version 4.0 news) - www.microsoft.com/ie/<br>Australian download sites for Netscape Communicator - werple.net.au/lions/software.htm<br></font></p>
