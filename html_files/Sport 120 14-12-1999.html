            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOMETHING is missing at Adelaide Oval. Or maybe that should read someone is missing.<br>It would appear to be Pakistani fast man Shoaib Akhtar.<br>Why else would the Channel 9 team make such obsessive use of the speed gun?<br>Clearly it is missing Shoaib badly. The speed gun was a relevant tool when the boastful young speedster declared he could get to 160kmh.<br>It was an entertaining sideshow during the three Tests against Pakistan to see Shoaib toss his glossy locks and strain to beat the 150kmh barrier.<br>And it was equally absorbing to compare and contrast his speed with that of better bowlers such as Damien Fleming and Glenn McGrath.<br>But Shoaib's gone home now with a cloud over his action as well as a failure to live up to all the hype.<br>We have the gentler, less tumultuous Indians on our screens. But for some reason we still have the speed gun out at every opportunity.<br>It is measuring some mediocre stuff such as Michael Kasprowicz's fastest ball of the day compared with the speed of his average delivery.<br>Or it is telling us that Anil Kumble - who never tires as Ian Chappell never tires of telling viewers - bowls about five to 10kmh faster than rival leg-spinner Shane Warne.<br>The commentary team, especially Mark Taylor, is spending an inordinate amount of time discussing these figures.<br>One suspects they haven't got a great deal else to talk about.<br>Sure there have been wonderful centuries by Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting, plus the swashbuckling 86 of Warne coupled with his good bowling.<br>But the characters and combativeness that marked the exciting series against Pakistan are not there.<br>What we are seeing from Adelaide appears to be a grim, slightly dispirited bunch of Indians who are being outclassed by this tough Australian team.<br>Look for a shining light to bring some passion and verve and you nearly always end with Sachin Tendulkar.<br>On Sunday, he occasionally lived up to the hype, particularly when he hit Kasprowicz for three successive fours.<br>But the little master, whose batting helmet appears two sizes too big, cannot by himself lift India above the ruck at the moment.<br>His captaincy appears to be the trouble. Indian supporters on the Internet and Indian newspapers have been especially critical in this Test.<br>Take this comment from a Net discussion group: ?Sachin is a fine bat but he is no leader of men and he is often found wanting in his handling of the bowlers and field placements.?<br>It has led to an Indian performance best summed up by the Indian Express: ?It is as though the Indian team has been mesmerised by being in Sir Donald Bradman's hometown.?<br>In fact, the most fascinating part of the weekend's action on Nine turned out to be the trivia question asking how many left-handed batsmen had captained Australia.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
