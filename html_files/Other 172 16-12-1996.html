            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT REALLY is a joke; our weather I mean. Not the fact that it almost turned to winter last Wednesday and Thursday after that chap Tod on Channel 9 promised a week of sunshine.<br>It was a bit of a shock waking to scudding showers, gloomy skies and cold stiff south-westerlies two days in a row.<br>And trying to warm to the hot, sexy sounds of Grace Knight at an outdoor concert was hard work, given that my friends and I had to shelter under an aluminium blanket half the time when we should have been welcoming a gentle zephyr under starry skies.<br>No, despite two doonas and the need for jumpers, I don't think it really was all that horrible. If we want weather to talk about we should try somewhere else, such as Melbourne, Manchester or New York.<br>We've got it pretty easy in Perth. If you want to open a boring conversation with someone try this: ?Today's fine, cloudless and sunny. I hear tomorrow's going to be the same ... and the next day ... and the day after. Right through to April 30 in fact.?<br>It's a little like goldfish in a bowl. There are those who claim to know that your average goldfish has an attention span of two seconds.<br>So, when they wag around a bowl, they are delighted to see a plant wriggling in the water. Apparently they say to themselves: ?That's a nice plant.? Two seconds later, having circumnavigated their universe, they again react with delight: ?That's a nice plant.?<br>How anyone knows this is better left unsaid, in case chaps with a stretcher and white coats knock on the door in the middle of the night.<br>Living in Perth actually prepares you for nothing else, but living in Perth.<br>The weather is one of the best cases in point. Several years ago the most gorgeous GYM (gorgeous young mum) of my acquaintance - my wife - and I were holidaying in Boston at Christmas.<br>It was picture-postcard stuff: snow quietly piling up, carol singers on street corners, lively shops and the general American passion for Christmas which extends to them decorating the grilles of their cars with wreaths and streamers.<br>But it was mighty cold, though perfectly sunny. One morning my GYM had a shower and, Perth-style, immediately went outside to take in the beautiful day. She had wet hair still.<br>The temperature, despite the sun, was about minus 8. Her hair froze instantly, so much so that if you rapped your knuckles on it, it sounded like someone at the door.<br>Weather is one thing, traffic another where living in Perth leaves one unprepared for the rest of the world.<br>This becomes apparent when Perth people holiday in South-East Asia. In Bangkok, for example, it can take more than an hour to go 10km.<br>In Jakarta, there is a six-lane expressway from the airport to the city centre.<br>But the first two lanes, at least, on each side, are given over to cyclists, families out walking and herds of goats. The remaining lane is where every other vehicle competes two abreast at high speed for the narrow space left.<br>Travellers to Europe have also come to realise that whatever they learnt at driving school in Perth - following the speed limit, giving way, keeping left - bore no resemblance to reality.<br>A couple of years ago the city of Naples in Italy made the wearing of seatbelts compulsory. Within two days the most popular item in town was a T-shirt with a seatbelt painted on it.<br>In Rome, surely the most futile job is that of the man who paints the white line down the middle of the road.<br>?It's a rough guide only signor,? a taxi driver told me as he zoomed to the Vatican one day.<br></font></p>
