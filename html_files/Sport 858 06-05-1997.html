            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">RUGBY league used to be called the greatest game of all. It is becoming the greatest shame of all.<br>Another nail in the code's coffin was driven in on Sunday when 40,623 people went to the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch the Swans slaughter Carlton in an AFL match.<br>Four rugby league games - all ARL - played in Sydney between Friday night and Sunday afternoon attracted a combined attendance of only 36,369.<br>The Swans-Blues match was just a normal home-and-away match, yet the Sydney Morning Herald reported on its front page that ticket scalpers had turned up outside the gates.<br>This is the exact reverse of what has happened at big rugby league games in Sydney - headquarters of the code - during the year. Or should I say at big Super League games.<br>The split in the code for the sake of pay-TV ratings - Super League with Foxtel and the ARL with Optus - has kept crowds at very poor levels.<br>Super League gave away tickets to NSW v Queensland at the Sydney Football Stadium a few weeks ago, and claimed a crowd only a few hundred bigger than the one that attended the Swans' opening match against Melbourne the same night at the neighbouring SCG. Both topped 23,000.<br>The give-aways were out again for the controversial Anzac Day Super League Test between Australia and New Zealand. The SFS crowd was 26,000, although TV viewers could see row on row of space.<br>Empty seats contribute nothing to a TV spectacle. It does not matter how good the actual game is, on television the atmosphere falls flat unless there is a good, noisy crowd as well.<br>Whether there is a TV spectacle or not in rugby league is becoming increasingly harder to judge in Perth. Without Optus, we have only Super League. Unless you have Foxtel - and not that many West Australians do - you are reduced to watching two games a week ... that is if you want to stay up until midnight.<br>Channel 9 slots Super League in the early hours. The ABC makes a better attempt to show the games on Sundays at 5pm.<br>Last Sunday we had Perth trampling Penrith. It was a good display from the Reds without drawcards Julian O'Neill and Mark Geyer, but was watched by a meagre crowd of just 7000.<br>That WACA Ground crowd must be a big worry for Super League. When the then Western Reds won their first match against St George in 1995, nearly 25,000 fans turned up.<br>If West Coast was drawing only 15,000 a week to Subiaco Oval, the AFL would worry.<br>The Eagles have worries of their own after the Western Bulldogs belted them at the WACA Ground on Friday night. Armchair critics would have loved the sight of Glen Jakovich powering back as if he'd never been away.<br>But in a few houses I know, the policy after hearing the score on ABC radio, was to ban watching of the replay.<br>It was a case of see no Eagle, hear no Eagle, speak no Eagle.<br></font></p>
