            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIANS can now buy and sell online at an auction site that will offer local, rather than just international, goods.<br>Yahoo Australia unveiled the site last Thursday.<br>?Yahoo is creating a global auctions platform which allows our users all over the world to buy from and sell things to each other,? said Tony Faure, general manager of Yahoo Australia & NZ.<br>?It's part of our ongoing commitment to foster online shopping and bring people, products and services together.?<br>Use of the site is free but buyers and sellers have to register so bids can be made with authorised user names and passwords.<br>The auction site offers more than 2000 different categories. Users can browse, bid or buy in categories such as toys and games, arts and entertainment, antiques and collectibles, computers and software, and electronics and cameras.<br>?One of the benefits of having a local auction site is that it's much less expensive for the user to pay shipping on something bought from a person in Melbourne than it is on the same product from Montana or Manchester,? Mr Faure said.<br>?Also, you can get by with a bank cheque instead of an international money order. The beauty of it, however, is that if you still want to buy the rare coin from the guy in New York, it's your choice.?<br>Australian users can specify if they want their items auctioned only to local users or are prepared also to auction them overseas.<br>Users can click on any category to browse through the inventories.<br>Once an item is submitted, Yahoo Auctions immediately opens the bidding. Sellers set auction parameters such as the price at which the auction will begin, reserve price and the length of time the auction will run.<br>Once an auction closes, bidders will be notified automatically by e-mail if they have the winning bid, and will receive contact information for the seller.<br>Sellers also will be automatically notified via e-mail with instructions on contacting the winning bidder to complete the auction transaction.<br>Yahoo Auctions is at:<br>au.auctions.yahoo.com/au/<br></font></p>
