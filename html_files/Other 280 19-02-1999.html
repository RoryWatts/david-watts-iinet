            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ON Tuesday evening I phoned my twin brother Duncan, who also wears an eye-patch. He just happened to be in Greenough, near Geraldton.<br>Me: Duncan, mate, did you see the eclipse? What was it like?<br>Twin: It was dark mate, really dark, black as pitch actually.<br>Me: Well eclipses are supposed to be dark, I don't know about black as pitch though. Did you look directly at it you boofhead?<br>Twin: Well yes I did as a matter of fact. But I took precautions.<br>Me: What sort of precautions? Special lenses, pinhole camera, what?<br>Twin: I wore two eye-patches.<br>Me: What, one on top of the other?<br>Twin: No. One on each eye you moron. What do you think I am, stupid?<br>Me: So it was black as pitch. What did you hear and feel then? Lots of funny things happen around eclipses; birds go home to roost, dogs go barking mad, the cows go home to be milked, the temperature cools etc.<br>Twin: No, didn't hear or feel anything. I stumbled into a hole in the bush and was stuck there for the duration. On account of the two eye-patches I guess.<br>Me: Yes, it would have been black as pitch.<br>Twin: As black as a caveman's . . .<br>Me: Ask me what I saw. Go on.<br>Twin: Okay, what did you see?<br>Me: Nothing actually. I tried to follow the eclipse on the Internet. There were live telecasts direct to computer screens.<br>Twin: So how come you saw nothing?<br>Me: Forgot to turn the computer on. So the screen was . . .<br>Twin: . . . black as pitch, I know, bit of a fizzer really.<br>Me: Talking of computers, did you get that Y2K memo I sent, the one that tells you how to bug-proof your computer against the dates being misread? If you don't, planes will fall from the sky, ATMs won't give money and they'll pay your insurance policy off to someone else.<br>Twin: Yeah. I've followed it through. It seemed stupid if you ask me, but if that's the way to solve it, then who am I to question.<br>Me: So what have you done?<br>Twin: I've changed all the Ys to Ks as recommended by the Y-to-K memo. Now my computer calendar has Januark, Februark, Mak and Julk. Hope it works.<br>Me: Me too. Let me know if January 1, 2000 passes without incident and I'll apply it to my PC.<br>Twin: Hey that means I'm the guinea pig, no fair. Life was simpler in the 60s before we had to worry about stuff like the Y-to-K bug.<br>Me: You mean when we were excited about getting into a hip, new joint?<br>Twin: Yes, now it's getting a new hip joint.<br>Me: Or moving to Broome because it was cool.<br>Twin: Now it's moving to Broome because it's warm.<br>Me: Getting your head stoned.<br>Twin: Getting your headstone.<br>Me: Long hair.<br>Twin: Longing for hair.<br>Me: Watching the Yanks fight to get rid of a lying president.<br>Twin: Watching them fight to keep a lying president.<br>Me: Taking acid.<br>Twin: Taking antacid.<br>Me: Trying to look like Marlon Brando or Elizabeth Taylor.<br>Twin: Trying not to look like Marlon Brando or Elizabeth Taylor.<br>Me: Popping pills, smoking joints.<br>Twin: Popping joints.<br>Me: ?Getting blind?.<br>Twin: Really going blind.<br>Me: We could go on like this for ages you know?<br>Actually we did, but in the interests of keeping tiresome family chatter out of this column, let's cut to a small joke instead.<br>A Coffin Cheater bikie, a bit the worse for wear, staggers into a bar. He has a pair of jumper leads around his neck and orders a beer.<br>The barman says: ?I'll serve you, but don't go starting anything.?<br>Twin: You were right about one thing . . . that was small.<br>Me: Oh shut up.<br></font></p>
