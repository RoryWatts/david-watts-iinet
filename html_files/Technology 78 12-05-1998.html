            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.au All sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>LEGAL<br>www.lawsocietywa.asn.au<br>This week is National Law Week and to celebrate, the Law Society of WA yesterday launched its new Web site. Features include a description of services offered by the Law Society to the local community (such as $50 wills this week), links to local legal firms and other legal resources, plus an interactive virtual museum tour of the Francis Burt Law Education Centre, which is housed in Perth's oldest building (built in 1836). If you've been considering seeking legal advice, visit the site this week because visitor questions (within reason, of course) will be answered by e-mail each weekday between 11am and 1pm. (SY)<br>MODERN LIFE<br>Bad Fads<br>www.adscape.com/badfads<br>Remember afro haircuts, hot pants, nehru jackets, bellbottoms, pet rocks and streaking? They are all here in a reasonably serious look at the fads that have come and gone in the past 40 years. Although this is an American site, many of the fads made it to our shores, mostly to disappear . . . thankfully. Some, like sideburns and mini-skirts, did not really disappear. They just faded and were reborn. Hula hoops, mood rings, rubik's cube and troll dolls seem to have had their day . . . but there is never any great certainty with human taste, particularly that conjured up by marketing and advertising. The fads are organised under the headings of: fashion, collectibles, events and activities. Fashion and collectibles have dozens of entries, but there are few in the others, and few, with the possible exception of streaking, that are memorable. (DW)<br>HUMOUR<br>Good Willie Hunting<br>www.nvisiondesign.com/<br>experiments-body-arcade.html<br>Regardless of which side of the White House imbroglio you're on, this game will make you happy. Called Good Willie Hunting by its creators and quickly renamed Whack a Bimbo by some players, this product of a Texas multimedia company opens with the White House in the background, a lawn full of holes and a worried looking Bill Clinton. Up through the holes pop the various players in the Clinton saga - Linda, Paula, Monica, Hillary, Socks the cat, Sam, Ken and a bucket of chicken. Click on the heads and Willie whacks them. Don't whack Socks though. His eyes bulge, he yowls and you lose a point. (WP)<br>SPORT<br>Australian Commonwealth Games Association<br>gatekeeper.ausport.gov.au/acga/<br>The Commonwealth Games will be held in Kuala Lumpur in September, but the Australian association has struck well ahead of time with this information-packed site that will be a sports lover's delight. It provides links to the official KL site - which we will look at closer to the time - as well as the site for the next games in Manchester in 2002. There is even a link to Melbourne's bid for 2006. The highlights, though, are the fact sheets that show Australia's proud record in every games, and records every medallist for the last three at least. There is also a look at who will be competing for Australia in KL, the program of events (that includes rugby and cricket), and official press releases. (DW)<br>SUPER SURFING<br>Metaspy - filtered<br>www.metaspy.com/spy/<br>filtered.html<br>This site is filtered, as it needs to be. It shows every 20 seconds what 12 different people are searching for with popular engines on the Web. An unfiltered look would produce some sewage, but thankfully the filtered version is fun enough. Engines used to produce the results are Yahoo, AltaVista, Lycos, Webcrawler and Infoseek. The search terms are grabbed at random, then presented as constantly updated links so you can go to the search results to find out what is exciting or intriguing other people on the Web. (DW)<br>FUN<br>Ads from the Comic Books<br>www.steveconley.com/comicads.htm<br>If you are old enough to remember reading trashy comic books and being more entertained by ads for black soap, x-ray glasses and handshake buzzers, this site is going to bring tears of nostalgia. It is great fun to have a look back at the advertisements that littered the back of those dodgy -- and even funny -- war or action comics that predominated in the 60s. Page after page is devoted to the ?amazing sea monkeys?, toy soldier sets, Charles Atlas courses, silly putty and the ?real man's slenderising belt?. If you are old enough to recall them, it is enlightening to revisit. If you are not, then be amazed at how daggy and innocent we all were. (DW)<br>FASHION<br>ApparelNet<br>www.apparel.net<br>Looking for some jewellery from Taxco, Mexico, or a store that sells that special pair of sunglasses? Start with this site's 2,000-plus links to other fashion and clothing-related Web pages, running the gamut from uniforms to hair ornaments to custom-made garments. It's easy to navigate and you don't have to see any pictures of ridiculously rail-thin models to find what you're looking for. (WP)<br></font></p>
