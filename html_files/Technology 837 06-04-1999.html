            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SENATOR Richard Alston wants to clean up the Net in Australia. He might have to close it down completely to do that, such is the magnitude of the task.<br>The cynics and online critics see the Communication Minister's plans to block and filter objectionable content as a move to placate Senator Brian Harradine, the Tasmanian Independent whose vote on GST and Telstra is crucial to the Government.<br>Senator Alston last week added more heat to the debate by attacking the Labor Opposition for sending out ?confused and mixed? signals about its attitude to cleaning up the Net. In the same attack, he used the sacred political phrase ?to safeguard Australian children?.<br>It shows more about his political grandstanding than an understanding of the way the medium has developed.<br>All the senator's political posturing has done so far is to attract attacks from people with vast experience online as well as campaigners for free speech.<br>On Thursday, Electronic Frontiers Australia announced the anti-censorship campaign was going global with 17 members of the Global Internet Liberty Campaign adding their weight.<br>The evidence from anti-censorship campaigners is that the medium cannot be policed easily. The people who put together sex sites, or hate sites, are too clever for governments wanting to score political points.<br>For example, you would expect a scumbag who creates a site called luridsex.com to feel the censor's wrath under Senator Alston's regime.<br>Not really ... he (almost certainly not she) would simply register a new domain name and have a pleasant-sounding site called familyvalues.com, complete with misleading tag words in the HTML coding to direct searchers to it.<br>This would also put filtering software off the scent; the same software that could stop an art student seeing a critique on Michelangelo's David because the word ?genitals? might appear.<br>Apart from that, the said scumbag might be in the US or Finland, or the Netherlands, and outside the scope of Australian law.<br>The Net, where it affects children, is mainly on a home or school computer. In the home, it operates as a private medium. At school, you would trust that teachers would be supervising its use.<br>The Net has the potential to drive us all into a more private world where individual rather than community standards rule.<br>The arbiters of what should and should not be on the Net in the home must be the adults responsible for the standards in that home, not a government, and not necessarily the makers of filtering software who have goodness-knows-what agenda to fulfil.<br>Senator Alston and others are right ... the Net has plenty of objectionable material. The sex site business makes a profit, unlike most commercial endeavours on the medium.<br>CHILDREN can access these sites accidentally, sometimes by mistyping the URL of a respected site. But unless they pay up by credit card - and how many responsible parents let their children carry plastic - they cannot explore them fully.<br>Still, the teaser pages for these sites are usually explicit enough, and sex site operators have devised a chaotic scheme called circle-jerking to make their titillation dominate the screen.<br>Adults have to realise the Net is not some mindless baby-sitter in the corner like Nintendo or the TV.<br>They have a choice to learn about the medium and help direct and supervise their children, as they would with any other grown-up enterprise. Or they can let senators Alston and Harradine have their way and let governments rule on what is consumed privately.<br></font></p>
