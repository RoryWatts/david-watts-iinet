            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">History tells us that in the 13th century Genghis Khan united the tribes of Mongolia, then raped, pillaged and burned his way to the conquest of China.He is said to have expressed the opinion that defeat of the enemy was not enough. Opponents had to be ?crushed utterly?. In the end, Genghis Khan laid the foundation of the greatest continental empire of mediaeval or modern times, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.This does not sound like it has much to do with the World Wide Web. But, to draw a long bow, reports from China in the past week indicate a conquest more befitting the nerdy 1990s is about to take place.And it may be a conquest every bit as spectacular as Genghis Khan's. Both CNN and the BBC, quoting the Xinhua news agency, reported that Microsoft had signed an agreement with China's biggest public telecommunications provider, China Telecom, to develop jointly a special Internet browser, called Internet Explorer China.China had 620,000 subscribers to the Internet at the end of last year. This is minuscule in proportion to the country's population of 1.2 billion. For example, Australia has about 1.5 million Net users among its 18 million people. But the Chinese figure has grown from 20,000 at the start of 1994, and is expected to reach 7 million by 2001. Fertile ground for Internet Explorer then.<br>The China deal came at the same time Microsoft chairman Bill Gates was telling US Senate hearings into the computer industry that his company - with 87 per cent of the world's operating system market - was not a monopoly.Web surfers can watch Mr Gates's long speech at a CNN special site with the impressive WebTheater video plug-in.For those who have seen the clever political farce Wag the Dog, in which a fake TV war is produced to draw attention away from a presidential sex scandal, the China deal has some worrying parallels. Did it really happen? BBC and CNN both quoted Xinhua, but there is no evidence of a report there.The only mention of Microsoft last week was a report about a deal in Kenya. The Microsoft Press Pass site does not mention it either. Press releases about China dealt only with corporate appointments.<br>Now the Web is not like TV ? yet. Surfers do not have to sit back and accept that the picture on TV is what is really happening. They can poke about and find much for themselves.<br>But, as in the case of this China deal, the process can be exhausting because of the sheer weight of sites and information. It becomes very tempting to do something else you can't do with a TV station: play an interactive game.<br>One doing the rounds at the moment and very relevant to Microsoft's march into China is the Pie Bill Gates game. This allows users to click madly on their screens as images of Mr Gates's head pop up from beneath pie dishes. A good click smashes a cream pie over his face. It borrows shamelessly from the popular Slap a Spice Girl (and Margaret Thatcher) game that was all the rage a year ago.<br>Ironically, it appears to download faster with Microsoft Internet Explorer than with Netscape.<br>HELP DESK Xinhua: www.xinhua.org:1997/indexe.htm<br>CNN special: www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/microsoft/<br>Wag the Dog: www.wag-the-dog.com<br>Microsoft Press Pass: www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/<br>Pie Bill Gates: www.fortunecity.com/underworld/<br>dukenukem/204/<br>Transperth: www.transperth.wa.gov.au<br></font></p>
