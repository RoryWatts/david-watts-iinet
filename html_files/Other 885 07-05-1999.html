            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MOTHER'S Day cannot come a moment too soon. It will give some relief to those women whose partners will choose - if they are brave enough - to watch four games of AFL football starting at noon tomorrow with the Eagles and finishing around 11pm with Brisbane v Collingwood. Then some may tune into the delayed telecast of Perth Glory's National Soccer League final.<br>Some poor downtrodden mothers may even have opted to live their lives with Fremantle supporters - indeed they may be Tony Modra fanciers themselves - and face their big day biting their nails and bursting their veins in sympathy with Damian Drum.<br>But, come the big day, hopefully no one will have to endure another second of that stupid television commercial in which the stylised 50s woman tries to talk to her mum on the toaster.<br>Telstra has used good public money to foist this dumbness on us in the hope of flogging mobile telephones. It has sometimes featured twice in a goal-inspired break during delayed football telecasts.<br>Do women so stupid exist? I have never met one, but that question sounds like a cue for a gratuitous blonde joke. You know why blonde jokes are so short don't you . . . so men can remember them.<br>Here it is anyway:<br>A motorcycle policeman pulled alongside a speeding car on the Mitchell Freeway. Glancing at the car, he was astounded to see that the blonde behind the wheel was knitting. The copper yelled to the driver, ?Pull over?. ?No,? the blonde yelled back, ?it's a scarf?.<br>The Telstra toaster lady is dumber than that no doubt. And it is intriguing to note that no woman I have ever known has looked like her, not in real life anyway. She comes straight from the fantasy world of American TV.<br>The image is straight Donna Reed, or Mrs Cleaver (Beaver's mum), or Patty Duke's mum, any number of neatly dressed, well-groomed impossibilities.<br>As a child of that era I never saw anyone like her. All the mums in our State Housing Commission area were too busy minding marauding gangs of children or chopping wood or cooking ever to look like that, unless they were going out in fancy dress.<br>The GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums) of today certainly look nothing like the stupid toaster lady, either. They are a busy lot, today's GYMs. But they still have much in common with those 50s mums. For a start they do not look like the dumb toaster lady, either, and they all can relate to this Mother's dictionary, sent in by an Internet correspondent:AMNESIA: Condition that enables a woman who has gone through labour to make love again.DUMBWAITER: One who asks if the kids would care to order dessert.FEEDBACK: The inevitable result when your baby doesn't appreciate the strained carrots.FULL NAME: What you call your child when you're mad at him.GRANDPARENTS: The people who think your children are wonderful even though they're sure you're not raising them right.HEARSAY: What toddlers do when anyone mutters a dirty word.IMPREGNABLE: A woman whose memory of labour is still vivid.INDEPENDENT: How we want our children to be as long as they do everything we say.OW: The first word spoken by children with older siblings.PUDDLE: A small body of water that draws other small bodies wearing dry shoes into it.SHOW OFF: A child who is more talented than yours.STERILISE: What you do to your first baby's pacifier by boiling it and to your last baby's pacifier by blowing on it.TOP BUNK: Where you should never put a child wearing Superman pyjamas.TWO-MINUTE WARNING: When the baby's face turns red and she begins to make those familiar grunting noises.WHODUNIT: None of the kids that live in your house.I'm off to buy my mother a mobile toaster.<br>David Watts: watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
