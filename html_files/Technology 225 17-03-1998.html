            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It would take very broad-minded adults to let children under 14 play Monty Python's The Meaning of Life game.<br>For a start it is not really a game, though there are mini-games within it. Secondly, it has some lurid and repulsive content ? if you saw the film it is based on, you will recall scenes such as the never-ending birth in the ?Third World? and the disgusting Mr Creosote who eats so much he explodes.Thirdly, it is far too childish - in a very adult way - for children. Best to ask one to install it on your PC, then tell them to hop it while the grown-ups experience one of the marvels of new technology: the intensely cinematic Python crew succeeding at being hilarious in a new medium. The Meaning of Life CD-ROM - all the Pythonesque press releases refer to it as a ?thingy? - almost defies description.It is totally unlike any other game on CD, particularly those endless Doom clones seen from behind an assortment of deadly weapons in dull gloom. And it appears to have little purpose in a gaming sense. You can look for clues and collect trinkets as you tour the many chapters. But really there is no compulsion.<br>It is like life itself. Maybe there is no meaning and we just tootle around doing silly things and trying to explain them until, like the Norwegian Blue, we bring down the curtain and join the Choir Invisible.Along the way we can have fun. This is precisely what the CD offers. It is a well-produced rendering of the famous film into a multimedia experience featuring 360-degree photography, oodles of animation - which one would expect given the Python penchant for silly imagery - and some quite deliciously naughty video and audio clips.American company 7th Level has teamed with Pythons John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam to create this game, which follows earlier releases of Complete Waste of Time and the Quest for the Holy Grail.<br>7th Level describes the game as comedy-strategy adventure. This is fine but the company also describes it as ?the first game designed exclusively for the betterment of humanity? and a ?CD-ROM game that no one will enjoy?.After that it is hard to know what to take seriously but, allegedly, the game uses the revolutionary, Python-patented Surround-o-Vision to enhance the experience.<br>Whatever it is, the imaging, animation and clever navigation with a gloved hand that sometimes tickles or gropes objects, is easy to use and colourful.Players can choose a chapter from The Meaning of Life, such as Birth, Fighting Each Other or Death, and then navigate around 360-degree images.When the cursor starts to glow, you can click and the images spring to life, often in riotously funny ways and most often with replays of scenes from the film.<br>There is plenty of new dialogue and artwork to complement the cast of grotesques - such as the doctors who call for the ?machine that goes bin? to enhance their enjoyment of the labour ward, for example.And, if you hit the right target, you can play a truly repulsive game such as Live Organ Transplants, where you try to carve open a live human being with your choice of axe, chainsaw or scalpel.<br>Don't say you haven't been warned.<br>HELP DESK<br>Python Online: www.pythonline.com<br>7th Level: www.7thlevel.com/python/<br>meaning_of_life/content.htm<br></font></p>
