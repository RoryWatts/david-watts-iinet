            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AS I was saying last week, blokes like things a bit different. If you remember their main interests are 1) TV 2) Footy 3) Beer and 4) Women.<br>This is not to say they are culturally inept, however. Far from it. Your average bloke likes nothing better than a good movie or book, even a bit of poetry or a night at the opera.<br>With this in mind I have decided to make a few lists of typical bloke entertainments. If you like any of the following, chances are you have some essential bloke qualities.<br>If you are a GYM (gorgeous young mum) and you like any of these, fear not, you do not require a sex-change operation. Chances are you have suffered passive blokeism by being exposed to such things by your partner - who must be a bloke, of course.<br>In no way are these definitive lists, nor are they ranked in any way except by the order they came into my head over a few beers.<br>Bloke movies:<br>Showgirls: There are times when the Las Vegas dancers and strippers put their clothes on, but thankfully they are rare. The acting and plot are appalling but few blokes fail to be riveted.<br>The Godfather (1 and 2): Both are treats of sex, violence, family relationships and the Mafia.<br>Anything with Humphrey Bogart: Years after his death his words and deeds concerning dames and crooks remain brilliant.<br>Terminator: Oh Arnie Schwarzenegger you've done it again. Only he could be incinerated in a sub-atomic explosion and reassemble his indestructible body parts to wreak more mayhem.<br>True Grit: Actually any John Wayne movie is a bloke-fest, particularly The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence and The Quiet Man (in which he brawls bare-knuckled across an entire Irish village for close to 10 minutes).<br>Goldfinger, Thunderball, From Russia With Love: Early James Bond is much, and often badly, imitated. Action, gadgets and Ursula Andress add flavour.<br>OTHER contenders include all the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon films and Braveheart. Mel Gibson at his best can be as tough as King Gee overalls.<br>Bloke TV:<br>Roy and HG: The Sydney comic duo is not acting. Real blokes are just like that.<br>The Footy Show: Ditto for Sam Newman and Doug Hawkins. There is a question mark over Eddie Maguire and his silly stats. Blokes want shirtfronts not hard-ball gets.<br>Men Behaving Badly: Nearly every bloke I know identifies with this. By the way the American copy is a joke.<br>Home Improvement: Tim ?the Toolman? Taylor is a very good American version of a bloke. Over there they call them guys, but they still work the same. The show's attractions are the power tools and Tim's lovely wife.<br>Rumpole: Epitomises what most blokes aspire to in old age grumpy wit and red wine.<br>Bloke books:<br>All Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck: These two Americans were great believers in the fellowship of men, aka mateship . . . and bullfighting, bulldust and just plain fighting. Oh, and fishing and women too.<br>All Robert Ludlum: Okay Ludlum is to literature what KFC is to cuisine, but we all need our junkfood from time to time. Nearly everything he writes is unbelievable, but that's fine if you don't want to think too hard.<br>Bloke poetry:<br>Believe it or not there is such a thing, so long as you don't read it aloud in a mincing voice while poncing about the stage. Best exemplified by:<br>The Sentimental Bloke: C.J. Dennis wrote this at the turn of the century and it still sums up most blokes' thoughts about Romeo and Juliet.<br>The Man From Snowy River: Anything by Banjo Paterson is a rollicking good, bushy, blokey bit of writing.<br>Bloke music:<br>Music is an entirely acceptable bloke pastime. How could you sing the club song 10 times after the game without liking music? Don't answer that.<br>Rather than individual songs I'll look at acceptable bloke artists.<br>Bruce Springsteen, particularly in his early Born to Run phase is essential listening as is Bob Seeger and Jim Morrison and the Doors. Doubts exist about The Rolling Stones, only because Mick Jagger can be such a mincer sometimes. But anyone with a wife as lovely as Jerry Hall must have a few good bloke qualities.<br>B.B. King is mandatory and the Three Tenors sing just how we'd all like to sound in the shower. I'll be off . . . got to go to macrame lessons.<br></font></p>
