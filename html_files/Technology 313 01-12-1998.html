            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS hard to know whether to be surprised by the results of the Watts Online browser survey.<br>A total of 110 readers responded to questions about their use of Web browsers.<br>They bucked world trends, they turned conventional wisdom on its head, they often revealed deep passions about their software ... most of them use Netscape in preference to the omnipresent Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>The readers who responded to the November 10 survey prefer Netscape to Microsoft by a resounding margin of 75 per cent to 21 per cent. Five respondents (or 4 per cent) use other products, nearly always the lightning fast Opera.<br>Figures from other surveys, admittedly far bigger ones, suggest Microsoft browser use now nearly matches Netscape.<br>However, Watts Online readers bucked even more trends.<br>The latest, most up-to-date version of Netscape (4.5) is not the overwhelming choice. Nearly a quarter of Netscape users indicated they use the two-year-old version 3.0.<br>Considering not everyone gave the version number, it is likely the 24 per cent figure is higher. Use of version 4.5 among others was about half that of earlier version 4s.<br>Some version 3.0 users felt moved enough to give reasons why they stuck with the - in Internet terms - old warhorse.<br>For example: ?I like it (version 3.0) - it does 98 per cent of what I want it to. Its main problem is the heavy Java sites. I find it simple, fast and small. I hate things with all the bells and whistles which sound great, but I never use, and I suspect that the majority of the people don't use either.?<br>Microsoft browser users preferred Internet Explorer 4.0 to version 3.0 by a margin of three-to-one.<br>From the results, it appears that Microsoft has a reasonable market penetration. While it lagged as the main browser, it was the main choice as ?other browser?, scoring 33 per cent of the vote to Netscape's 13. The biggest score was ?none? by 44 per cent of people.<br>But several people added comments to their answers, saying their use of Microsoft was not always their choice.<br>One wrote he used Microsoft ?only to explain to friends over the phone how to do something. Then it's straight back to Netscape.?<br>Another said: ?Reluctantly had to load Explorer 4 to check Web site.?<br>In fact deep dislike of Microsoft dominated respondents' comments (nearly half of the 110 felt moved to write something in addition to answering the questions).<br>Fairly typical of the antiMicrosoft sentiments were these:<br>?After using at least three different browsers I find Netscape offers the most features I want. Explorer is a bunch of mush so to speak. Too much frill and not enough substance.?<br>?I find Netscape far superior to IE, especially now it is more stable. I find Netscape is easier for navigating back and forward through long, complex search patterns.?<br>Microsoft had its adherents as well. ?I chose MSIE4 mainly because it is integrated in Win98 anyway, so why clutter up my hard drive with more bloatware which does the job of what I've already got??<br>Although this respondent added: ?Not that I think Microsoft's offering is better than Netscape, just that I had it anyway, and didn't need two.?<br>One of the most revealing things in the survey was the respondents' Net-savviness.<br>One hundred (or 91 per cent) had upgraded their browser at some time. One even went through the chain from Netscape 1.0 back in 1994.<br>The respondents were not afraid to download and install off the Net either, with 73 per cent saying they had.<br>Those who commented said they mostly upgraded from Australian FTP sites. A number preferred upgrading by using CD-ROMs from magazines.<br>The issue of whether Microsoft has an unfair advantage by supplying MSIE 4.0 with new Windows PCs was impossible to resolve.<br>The survey asked whether a browser had been included with the PC when bought.<br>A total of 84 per cent said no, but as year of purchase was not queried, that result fails to show whether inclusion of IE 4.0 (which is relatively recent) had any effect.<br>Just over 40 per cent said their Internet service providers had supplied a browser with start-up kits, but the question failed to ask which one.<br>Some respondents said they had been offered a choice. Some said they made their own decisions and used the supplied browser to download a different one.<br>Overall, the survey suggests the respondents are experienced users with a great deal of loyalty to the Netscape brand.<br>Watts Online browser survey<br>Which browser do<br>you use regularly       Netscape 75%         Microsoft 21%  Others 4%<br>Which other browser<br>do you use              None 44%   Netscape 13%   Microsoft 33%  Others 10%<br>Have you upgraded       Yes 91%    No 9%<br>Did you do it on<br>the Net                 Yes 73%    No 27%<br>Was your present<br>browser on your PC      Yes 15%    No 85%<br>Was a browser with<br>your ISP's start-up<br>software                Yes 42%    No 58%<br></font></p>
