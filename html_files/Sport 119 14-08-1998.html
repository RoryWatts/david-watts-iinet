            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TUESDAY is the worst day of the week. On Mondays, there is Talking Footy; Live and Kicking screens on Wednesdays; Thursdays belong to the Footy Show, and from Friday to Sunday the AFL is wall-to-wall.<br>But on Tuesdays not a handball or a hammie. It is dire, but not Jack Dyer, unfortunately.<br>This realisation came at the same time it dawned on me I am addicted to the game. Though this has been bleeding obvious for years to those I know and love, it has not been so to me.<br>Sure I lounge about watching every match and replay all weekend, and only speak to yell ?you idiot?. But I thought everyone did that . . . well, the blokes at least.<br>I know this behaviour ranks me somewhat below the dog in the affections of the family between March and September. But I thought that was the BO produced by refusing to leave the TV set.<br>But all became blindingly clear the other Tuesday night.I was sitting and staring on the veranda, there being absolutely no footy to watch, when I realised I was mentally reciting the results of every Eagles game this year.<br>And I got all the scores right.<br>Immediately before this procession of ?North 15.13 d Eagles 15.11?, I had been naming the team to win the premiership, given that Andrew Donnelly, Chris Mainwaring and Brett Heady were all fully fit.<br>And I had been shuffling the side, placing Peter Matera in the forward pocket and Glen Jakovich at full-forward.<br>I had even cried out: ?But what if David King cuts loose? Will I have to swap Drew Banfield for Roo??<br>Then I sat down and proved, by carefully analysing every quarter of the year, that West Coast left the rest for dead . . . if the game was only half as long.<br>When this addiction hit I know not. It may well have been 20 years ago. As a Queenslander just moved to Melbourne, I thought it would be a bit of a wheeze to watch the Richmond-Carlton match that opened the 1978 season at the MCG.<br>I came away with bright eyes and bushy tail and immediately hired a TV set so I could watch everything to do with the game. I even thought Lou Richards was terrific.<br>Then again it might have been when I went to Moorrabbin with a mate. ?You've got to have a team, Dave, or everyone will think you're peculiar<br>. . . or a Queenslander.?<br>So St Kilda it was, with names like Robbie ?Mad Dog? Muir, Rex Hunt (the same), Trevor Barker and WA's Gary Sidebottom (who we used to call Siddy-bottom).<br>Maybe it wasn't then, maybe it was in 1991 after returning from England to find an established West Coast lighting up the Perth scene.<br>Maybe it was only last year when I became a member and was able to get a regular seat at Subiaco and scream ?oh no, Fraser, what are you doing? with the rest of the desperates.<br>Whenever it was, it has had some devastating side-effects as any sort of addiction does.<br>LAST week a GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) friend had the temerity to have her birthday party on the same day as West Coast's critical clash with Sydney. The timing of the bash meant I got to see only the woeful first quarter in which the Eagles bumbled to be 21 points adrift. Then the partygoers had to make merry.<br>I was miserable. At the restaurant where we partied, a mate and I bribed the waiter to bring us the score. ?Stuff the chicken, son, just give us the result.?<br>Naturally we killed him quietly because there were Docker fans present when he delivered the news - Sydney by a goal.<br>But it sounded like a stirring fightback and I was glad that I had set up the VCR to tape the last three quarters.<br>Party over, it was a mad rush to get to the TV, rewind the tape and get an hour or so fix.<br>But the tape was scrambled. We had had it 10 years and had taped everything from LA Law to South Park on it in the interim.<br>I quietly hurled it into the backyard with a scream of ?you idiot?.<br>Now I need a big fix. Thank God it's Friday.<br>Come on Dockers, save Gerard's hide.<br></font></p>
