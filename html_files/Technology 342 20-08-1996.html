            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A CURTIN University undergraduate is making big waves for World Wide Web surfers.<br>Bassam Aoun is only 19 but his work on searching the Net has brought him global attention already.<br>In October Mr Aoun will address WebNet 96, the conference of the Web Society in San Francisco. His topic is his creation, Bargainbot, a search agent designed to provide netizens with fast and accurate details of books and their comparative prices at various Web bookstores.<br>Bargainbot is just the first of myriad agents Mr Aoun predicts will make Net shopping and other business easier.<br>The well documented growth and popularity of the Web is its greatest asset and also its greatest drawback. The ability to find exactly what you want is hampered as more and more people put information into the almost unordered cacophony of cyberspace.<br>Mr Aoun sees the need to cut through the rubbish and focus exactly on what people want.<br>Information overload is already a problem and it is going to get much worse unless intelligent search mechanisms are used.<br>?Automatic, autonomous browsing has an increasingly important task in information discovery and assisted browsing on the Internet,? Mr Aoun says in an introduction to his latest work on Bargainbot.<br>?Where users could once keep up to date with information of interest, the growth of the network has made this process increasingly time consuming and less rewarding.?<br>Bargainbot allows simultaneous searching of many bookstores on the Net. It filters and formats its findings to allow price comparisons by a shopper who can then choose the best value and order online.<br>The multi-threaded, multi-connection architecture can be applied to other activities, and this where Mr Aoun's work is heading.<br>?I'm looking at developing the technology to an extent that it becomes a personalised agent providing a customised interface to information of interest to the user on the network,? Mr Aoun said at the weekend.<br>His work has attracted the interest of several international researchers including Dr Krulwich, the creator of BargainFinder, the Web's first electronic commerce agent.<br>Mr Aoun's latest project is called SearchScript, a multiple search engine that makes information retrieval more efficient and thorough.<br>SearchScript allows a user to call into play several search engines at once from a Netscape browser.<br>By simply keying in the search term and clicking a button, Yahoo, Lycos, Excite and Alta-Vista are activated at the same time.<br>Searches are still made even if one or more of these popular engines is down.<br>Users can also personalise SearchScript so it uses only the engines they prefer.<br>?SearchScript was developed because of the increasing need to utilise the specific strengths of particular search engines,? Mr Aoun said.<br>?I'm also looking at further personalising SearchScript to provide for user-specified destinations. This will provide the ability for users to search the Internet databases of their choice ... not necessarily those of search engines.?<br>URLs: www.ece.curtin.edu.au/~saounb/bargainbot/<br>www.ece.curtin.edu.au/~saounb/search/<br></font></p>
