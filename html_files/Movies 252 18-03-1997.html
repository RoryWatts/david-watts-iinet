            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE list of Oscar trivia is long but rarely dull. And there appears to be enough variety at the many sites visited by WestWeb to satisfy film lovers - and haters - of all persuasions.<br>It is also likely that determined film buffs will know full details of the awards well before they are shown on TV here. The official Web site for the Oscars is promising almost immediate updates from Los Angeles on award night.<br>Those who want to have their say also have a variety of choices. At Mr Showbiz, a facility called the Water Cooler allows people to vent their feelings about a different movie issue every day.<br>At the official Oscar site you can send Academy Award host Billy Crystal jokes to tell on the big night.<br>Comedian Crystal (of When Harry Met Sally and City Slickers) has taped a message which can be viewed using the recently released RealVideo player.<br>Elsewhere, surfers can read the Oscar tips of one of the world's most famous film critics, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times.<br>And Microsoft Cinemania has an essay about the often wide difference of opinion about films between critics, the academy and the public.<br>Just to emphasise this difference, have a look at the Internet Movie Data Base to see what movies the public has voted for.<br>The Web has much to teach us about the Academy Awards, which are presented next Monday.<br>For example:<br>?The first Best Picture award in 1927-28 went to Wings.<br>?In 1939, Gone with the Wind won Best Picture ahead of Dark Victory, Goodbye Mr Chips, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Of Mice and Men, Stagecoach, The Wizard of Oz and Wuthering Heights - a good year.<br>?Only an accountant of the firm Price Waterhouse knows the precise voting figures in any category. No one is ever told which film came second, third, or last for that matter.<br>?The statuette known as Oscar weighs nearly 4kg.<br>?The idea for the presentation of Oscars was hatched at a Hollywood banquet on May 11, 1927, one week after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was organised.<br>Louis B. Mayer, president of MGM, urged that the academy create a special film award. Cedric Gibbons, an art director for MGM, quickly sketched a figure of a knight holding a crusader's sword standing atop a reel of film whose five spokes signified the five original branches of the academy (actors, directors, producers, technicians and writers).<br>URLs:<br>Hollywood Online - www.hollywood.com/oscars/index.html<br>Microsoft Cinemania - Cinemania.msn.com/Cinemania/Features/Essays/ThatsEntertainment.h   Mr Showbiz - www.mrshowbiz.com/awards/oscars/<br>Roger Ebert - www.suntimes.com/ebert/ROG-Mar07.html<br>Academy official site - www.ampas.org/ampas/<br>Official Oscar site - www.oscar.com/1-fst.html<br>Internet Movie Data Base - us.imdb.com/Oscars/<br></font></p>
