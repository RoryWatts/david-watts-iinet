            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET users will have enough to think about on January 1, 2000. They will be hoping the Y2K bug has minimal effect on their activities.<br>If the prospect of broken servers, black-outs and empty ATMs was not enough, they now have to contend with a very different Y2K bug.<br>This bug is called Internet censorship. Richard Alston's plans to block access to X-rated content and check the age of anyone wanting to see R-rated material are likely to come into force on Y2K day.<br>That is when the Australian Broadcasting Authority is to be given the power to investigate complaints about content, not just on the Web, but in newsgroups and chat rooms as well.<br>The ABA will then pass on legitimate complaints to the National Classification Board which will rate the content, just as it does with non-Net media such as film and TV.<br>My opinion is that Senator Alston's regime is wrong and will not work. I think:<br>? The Net is being treated as something it is not, that is TV. Its two million Australian users already know that the Net is not some passive babysitter like TV.<br>? The perception driving censorship is that the Net is full of bomb-making recipes, hate sites and smut. You nearly always have to want to get this sort of material to see it. Rarely will someone come across offensive content by accident. In the case of sex sites, the US cnet organisation recently found the proportion of sex sites to other content had dropped. And nearly all sex sites exist to make money so it is not possible to explore them without credit card payment.<br>? Senator Alston has no specific technology in mind when talking about filtering out X sites. This will be left to ISPs. The majority say existing filtering technology will be easily bypassed by determined creators of offensive content. They also point out the amount of material to filter is forbidding.<br>? Net censorship will probably make access for Australians more expensive and slower as ISPs are forced to apply filters.<br>? Senator Brian Harradine's fear, expressed in Senate committee meetings two years ago, is that Australian children will be able to see full-length movies or TV shows on the Net which have not been rated. The technology that would allow such massive bandwidth is some way off, possibly five years at least, and is very expensive.<br>? Parents might assume that with Net censorship they no longer have to understand or supervise what their children see and do in the belief that ISPs are screening out the nasties. But as ISPs have pointed out, any present filtering will probably be ineffective and nasties will still be there.<br>As I said, all this is my opinion. The great thing about the Net is that it is adult and democratic enough to provide plenty of resources for people to make up their own minds.<br>HELPDESK<br>The Bill:<br>www.ozemail.com/~mbaker/9907720.html<br>Senate committee Hansard:<br>www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/<br>commttee/comsen.htm<br>EFA resources:<br>www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/99.html<br>WAIA resources:<br>www.waia.asn.au/Issues/<br>Regulation/DCITA/<br>Liberty or Tyranny:<br>rene.efa.org.au/liberty/<br>Australian Broadcasting Authority<br>www2.onlineaustralia.net.au/aba/index.html<br></font></p>
