            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GERI HALLIWELL - the pop star formerly known as Ginger Spice - is responsible for a lot of aggravation in my household.<br>When she quit the phenomenon known as the Spice Girls last week there was violence and depression in my environment. Not that I care two hoots about the split.<br>Spice Girls music is just a boppy rerun of all that bubble gum and sugary pop from every era since Little Richard sang ?boopwappadoolababompbamboom? . . . or words to that effect.<br>And the girls themselves are a little too up-front for the likes of a mature gent such as I, who finds GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums) far more appealing.<br>Mind you, that Posh Spice is a bit of orright, know what I mean guvnor and all that (they are pretty Poms, after all, so excuse the vernacular).<br>The grief here started last Sunday when my wife and I were reading a weekend newspaper report of the break-up.<br>Now it was that weekend newspaper that believes coverage of mini-skirted, belly-button revealing singers of dubious quality deserves more space than the threat of nuclear war between India and Pakistan.<br>So to accompany the big report of little consequence to world peace, this paper threw in a whopping big picture of Ginger Spice in her trademark Union Jack outfit, the one that barely covers the territory once known as unmentionables.<br>My wife said: ?You can see her crotch.?<br>I simply said: ?Yes.?<br>When I recovered from the effects of the savage blow to the head, I learnt there are ways to say ?yes?, and apparently I'd done the drooling kind, which is not on, guvnor.<br>That was the violence.<br>Now the depression. I am actually typing this column very quickly on my home computer. My time is short . . . no, not in that way.<br>I have had computer time rationed to bursts of about 15 minutes every four or five hours if I'm lucky.<br>This is because we have the Internet. It is my main avenue of work and I find it the best tool for communication and education known to man.<br>Why, on a Saturday afternoon I can watch one game of AFL football on TV and simultaneously track, on the Net, the progress of all other games.<br>After that much education on the state of play, I can communicate via e-mail with fellow fans and say informed things like: ?The Bulldogs are big sheilas' blouses, nyaah, na-na-na-na.?<br>The Net also carries oodles of Spice Girls trivia.And my daughter - who previously looked on the computer as a bit of a gadget for nerdy boys like her DOD (Dear Old Dad) - has hit the keyboard in a frenzy.<br>See, she loves Ginger Spice, adores her over-the-top performing and her under-dressed appearance. She even owns a wretched Ginger Spice doll.<br>And since she got her nerdy DOD to teach her how to search for Spice Girl sites I've barely had 10 minutes straight at finding truly important things like the state of Glen Jakovich's ankle.<br>My daughter is madly trying to contact Ginger to ask her to reconsider her decision to split from the group on the eve of its US tour (if you smell a publicity stunt you're not the only one).<br>I think it would be easier to find Elvis Presley's present address than Ginger's. The girls who love to soak the world in revealing publicity are coy about leaving an actual postal address.<br>As the search goes, my daughter creates an aftermath of dozens of photos of the girls and philosophical lines from them about how they enjoy toast and honesty.<br>I can't wait for Ginger to see the light and restore sanity around here.Know what I mean, guvnor . . .<br></font></p>
