            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE three of us were having some nosh the other night after the movies (Love and Other Catastrophes - see it) and the conversation was going typically well.<br>He: ?The Eagles, hey.?<br>Me: ?Yeah, Benny Cousins greaaat ... aarghh.? (Reminder to self: do not say Benny Cousins great with a mouthful of carbonara and chardonnay again).<br>She: ?Anthony Koutoufides has the cutest bottom in the AFL.?<br>You could have knocked He and Me over with a McKenna handpass. Not only had She put a verb in the works, and talked about the enemy from Carlton with affection; she also moved the conversation on to a more thoughtful plane.<br>I have no opinion on Koutoufides' bottom, except that perhaps now I understand why opposition players always want to see the back of him.<br>No butts about it, so to speak, bottoms are as perennial as the grass. We all have them and use them dozens of times a day without giving them a second thought.<br>Nothing is as cute as a baby's bottom, so the saying goes. And another saying, directed at a curvaceous Melbourne girl I once knew, was that from behind she looked as if she was hiding two possums under a blanket.<br>I can't recall any Biblical or Shakespearean bottom quotes, though I'm sure there were some. In fact The Bard of Avon had a character called Bottom in a Midsummer-Night's Dream. But a good old Australianism is to approach someone from behind and say: ?There's a familiar face.?<br>The wonderful WA author Tim Winton wrote a children's book called The Bugalugs Bum Thief in which the thief stole bottoms. When they were recovered, no one would claim their own, fearing ridicule at having a disastrous derierre. So the lights were turned off and all those sans-bottom were able to be refitted with a semblance of dignity.<br>In the mildly funny Hollywood film Coneheads, Dan Aykroyd played an alien who managed to assimilate with the natives of New York suburbia. He was so successful that he joined the local golf club. But when he went to the shower after 18 holes with the other 50-something hackers - whose bottoms were remarkable only for their ordinary hairiness - it was revealed he had no opening in his backside, but two handles positioned at hip height.<br>This caused the childish audience of ... well, children ... to laugh like drains. Kids love bottoms. Indeed any four-year-old can usually reel off a dozen or so botty and potty jokes without prompting.<br>Why this obsession? I have no idea, but just drop the word ?bottom? into polite conversation and see where it takes you.<br>???<br>SMALL things amuse small minds department: in England a man called Howard Stone is making a bit of a name for himself as a photographer.<br>Mr Stone once drove a delivery van and the job bored him. He found, however, that his van could be persuaded to produce very loud, frightening backfires when he wanted it to.<br>So he mounted a camera, pointing backwards, from the back window of the van and hid it behind a retractable black cloth shutter which he operated with a long cable-release while driving.<br>?I would make the van backfire and photograph the frightened mayhem I'd created as I drove past. Out of (partial) consideration for my fellow man, I avoided pensioners, dentists' surgeries and gynaecologists,? he says.<br>?I never knew what I'd captured until I developed the film and I had a lot of failures.?<br>Let's just hope he could tell the pedestrians with a history of congenital heart disease, or those who were refugees from Bosnia or Chechnya.<br>Mr Stone's creative intelligence is of the sort that helps make shows like Candid Camera and Australia's Funniest Home Videos.<br></font></p>
