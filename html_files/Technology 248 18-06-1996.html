            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE historic defeat of US Internet censorship laws last week will affect government attempts to regulate cyberspace in Australia.<br>A US federal court ruled last Thursday that the Communications Decency Act violated the guarantee of free speech in the First Amendment of the US Constitution.<br>The Act, signed by President Bill Clinton in February, was designed to stop children's access to pornography on the Net, but critics attacked it as too intrusive in that it severely limited adult use of the Net as a revolutionary new medium.<br>Three judges in Philadelphia agreed the law was excessively strict, saying the Act was too broad and in effect parents and other adults should supervise children's Net access, not the Government. They also said that relatively cheap software existed to make this possible.<br>The ringing declaration of free speech was best summed up by Judge Stewart Dalzell who said: ?Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.?<br>The ruling is certain to be challenged but for the moment the US Net community is celebrating a decision deemed even more significant because it is believed none of the judges is a Net user.<br>The Clinton administration has not decided whether it would be a party to any appeal to the Supreme Court.<br>The decision has wide implications here, according to Electronic Frontiers Australia, a voluntary organisation fighting censorship.<br>NSW Attorney-General Jeff Shaw has proposed Net censorship that the EFA claims would ?turn the Internet into a kindergarten?, banning any material unfit for 15-year-olds or younger and threatening big fines and jail sentences for anyone caught sending or looking at such material.<br>The proposals go to a meeting of all State attorneys-general on July 11, just 12 days after the Australian Broadcasting Authority announces the findings of its probe on Net regulation.<br>The US Net victory is significant, the EFA says, in that it provides a loophole for NSW users and service providers.<br>?Since the location of the Net hardware is largely irrelevant to the users, the US decision has more direct consequences to Australia,? Mr Yee said.<br>?It makes it totally impossible for the Australian government to turn the Internet into a kindergarten. And Australian companies have somewhere they can move their data and businesses if regulation here is too burdensome.?
