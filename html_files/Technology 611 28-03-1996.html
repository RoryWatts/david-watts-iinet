            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ANGRY Internet users are organising a national boycott of Nine Network's A Current Affair to protest against the program's treatment of the Paxtons.<br>Dozens of correspondents in the aus.tv newsgroup have attacked ACA's handling of the report and campaigning successfully to have the family's benefits cut off.<br>The ABC's Media Watch program focused on the affair, calling ACA's host Ray Martin and reporter Mike Munro ?Kerry Packer's bully boys? and condemning the show for picking on defenceless teenagers.<br>The Media Watch report has been the catalyst for outcry on the Net. The show is one of the most watched by Net users, according to a small survey for The West Australian last year. It rated second to the X-Files.<br>The aus.tv outrage began this way last week: ?Today I make this pledge - I will never watch ACA again, even for 30 seconds if I can avoid it, and all other current affairs programs and news programs are on probation.<br>?I urge you all to do the same - and tell your friends. This type of media thuggery must stop and the only way to hit them is in the ratings.?<br>About 20 follow-up messages in the next two days all agreed and built indignation to the point of an organised boycott, including a Web petition to the network.<br></font></p>
