            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ADVOCATES of free speech on the Internet want Web sites spared from the Racial Discrimination Act.<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia told the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission last week that application of the Act against material at the Adelaide Institute's site would be counter-productive.<br>The commission is hearing a complaint against the site by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. It is the first time the racial hatred legislation has been tested in relation to the Net.<br>The council - Australia's main Jewish group - wants the removal of what it calls malicious anti-Jewish propaganda from the site and an apology from its Adelaide operator.<br>EFA board member Danny Yee said the Act should not be applied to Web sites for both principled and pragmatic reasons.<br>?While telling race-based jokes in the pub is probably unlawful under the RDA, that is hardly something the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is, or should be, involved in,? he said. ?But your chances of overhearing racist jokes in a pub are vastly greater than your chances of unwittingly stumbling over offensive material on the Adelaide Institute's Web site.?<br>Another EFA board member, Irene Graham, said attempts to suppress so-called online hate speech would only result in its publication overseas.<br>?Rather than publicising offensive speech by attempting to censor it, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry would be better advised to make factual information available on their own Web site,? she said.<br>Around the world, organisations such as the Nizkor Project and other members of the Holocaust Ring provided extensive information countering the material distributed by the Adelaide Institute.<br>In an open letter to the Human Rights Commission, the EFA said it deplored racist and hateful speech. But the best remedy was more speech, not enforced silence.<br>?While the application of existing law to the Internet is still in its infancy, the well-established free speech principles should apply with even greater force to networked speech,? the EFA letter said.<br>?The Internet gives its users easy access to public discourse. It affords human rights activists and other opponents of racism with an inexpensive and effective method for responding to racist speech.?<br>The group argued that Web sites reached a relatively restricted actual audience and were not intrusive like billboards or television. ?Web sites do not appear on computer screens unbidden; one must choose to view a Web site and take affirmative action to do so,? the EFA said.<br>The Adelaide Institute describes itself at its site ?as a group of individuals who are looking at the Jewish-Nazi Holocaust, in particular we are investigating the allegation that Germans systematically killed six million Jews?.<br>The institute devotes many long pages of text arguing against generally accepted views of the Holocaust.<br>Help Desk<br>EFA letter: www.efa.org.au/<br>Publish/hreoc.html<br>Racial Discrimination Act:<br>www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/<br>consol-act/rda1975202/s18c Rights and Equal Opportunity<br>Commission: www.hreoc.gov.au<br>Executive Council of Australian Jewry:<br>www.join.org.au/ecaj/ecaj.htm<br>The Adelaide Institute: www.adam.<br>com.au/fredadin/adins.html<br>Nizkor Project: www.nizkor.org<br>Holocaust Ring: www.netbistro.com/<br>electriczen/holoring.html<br>Global Internet Liberty Campaign<br>statement on hate speech: www.gilc.<br>org/speech/un/gilc-hate-speech.html<br></font></p>
