            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AN OLD joke has an Australian ice-skater performing abysmally in a major competition.<br>He falls repeatedly, needs help to get up from the splits and ends the routine crashing through the ice, nose first.<br>The judges display their scores: Norway 0; Britain 0.5; US 0; Russia 0; Ireland 9.5.<br>No one can believe it. Asked how he could give the worst performance in ice-skating history 9.5, the Irish judge retorts: ?It's slippery out there.?<br>It is not just slippery at the Georgia Tech diving pool, it is wet and risky as well.<br>Diving makes good television. The cameras get close on the faces of the competitors as they psyche themselves up. Several slow-motion angles follow every twist and turn, allowing viewers to see both the beauty and strength needed to execute reverse three-and-a-halfs from the springboard.<br>How, then, do you separate the pack? There are obvious bad dives, but the top 20 competitors look and perform remarkably similarly.<br>Channel 7 is lucky to have former Australian champion Steve Foley to elaborate on the finer points and provide a foil for the ebullient Drew Morphett.<br>Foley, like Neil Brooks at the swimming last week and Liz Chektovich at the gymnastics, knows his stuff and guides we mere mortals through the replays, highlighting the good and bad points of a dive.<br>?Didn't rise high enough there ... let his feet fall apart there ... probably panicked when he nearly hit the board.?<br>And Foley has fun doing it. He has to calm down Morphett at times, especially yesterday in the men's springboard preliminaries when the commentator claimed a Mexican's efforts should ?get no points at all?.<br>Foley explained there were a few redeeming features of a dive, which in this class resembled more a Saturday afternoon bombie. But Morphett said: ?Ah, the judges are just being kind to him? as he collected 2.5 and 3.0.<br>The form of Michael Murphy for Australia was excellent and promises a medal.<br>In the cacophony of breakfast and school preparations it was difficult to hear the television yesterday morning, but I swear I heard Bruce McAvaney say that Australian athletics medals would be a big ask.<br>It is remarkable how rarely the footy cliche has surfaced in Atlanta. In fact, I've only heard it once before - at the rowing, where John Boultbee uttered it to the throat-clearing discomfort of the excitable Peter Landy.<br>BUT yes, Bruce, you do just get the feeling medals are going to be a big ask.<br>Cathy Freeman looked comfortable in her semi-final of the 400m. But no one looked as good as American superstar Michael Johnson in his 400m. It was a Sunday stroll in stunning time that left the rest of the semi-final field gasping for breath, hanging their heads and clutching their sides.<br>WA marathon runner Sue Malaxos probably would have been more to the point in describing the runners' condition. She certainly called a spade a bloody shovel when Channel 7 finally discovered she had finished the marathon and asked her the mandatory ?How do you feel??<br></font></p>
