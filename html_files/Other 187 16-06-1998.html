            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Chateau of Versailles<br>www. chateauvers ailles.fr<br>Opulence and decadence marked the reign of the Sun King, Louis XIV. Those two things have contributed to a legacy of astounding beauty at the royal palace, the Chateau of Versailles, just outside currently soccer-mad Paris. Versailles is one of the scenic, artistic and architectural wonders of the world. No less so is this site on the World Wide Web. It is magnificent, allowing surfers to learn the history of the chateau via a virtual reconstruction of Louis XIV's day; to be able to navigate places like the Hall of Mirrors and Throne Room with 360-degree Java technology; to view some of the collosal works of fine art and to gobble up a wealth of trivia such as the fact that the chateau houses 6000 paintings and has 11 hectares of roof area. It is the art and its presentation that makes this site so wonderful. No wonder really, because Versailles is not only a royal residence but also the home of the Museum of French History. (DW)<br>Harley-Davidson 95th anniversary<br>95th.harley-davidson.com<br>Harley-Davidsons are without doubt the most famous motorbikes in the world. Perth's paradise-type weather - no, not in winter - brings them out in a rash. Harleys have been around since 1903, would you believe. This company-built site is not content to look at the road the bike has travelled since then, but at the road ahead - the future. It is packed with stories by Harley lovers and features an interactive map of the US designed to show riders the best bike trips. (DW)<br>NBL Basketball play-offs<br>www.dek-net.com<br>The National Basketball League play-offs tipped off last week and this site - actually recommended by the Unofficial NBL Page - covers all the action. It is full of the latest news and results and carries a host of<br>links to all the NBL clubs, and nearly everything else connected to<br>basketball. (DW)<br>Llanfair pwllgwyngull gogerychwyrn drobwllll antysilio gogogoch<br>www.nwi.co.uk/llanfair<br>Llanfair pwllgwyngull gogerychwyrn drobwllll antysilio gogogoch ( This word should read as one but had to be broken up so that the story could be loaded into the data baser) is a small village in Wales with a very long name - the longest name in the UK, in fact. And it is that name, which translates to ?Saint Mary's Church in the hollow of the white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of Saint Tysilio of the red cave?, which has led to it becoming a major tourist destination. In fact it was for tourism that the village was so named. In the 1850s, when a railway was built from Chester to Holyhead, a local committee was established to come up with ideas for encouraging travellers to get off the train at the little stop. It was a humble cobbler who devised the name, which is regarded as one of the most successful tourism marketing strategies of all time. If you want to know the intricacies of Welsh pronunciation, see the site - it includes an audio file and step-by-step instructions for getting your tongue around it. (SS)<br>OpenSearch<br>www.opensearch.com<br>OpenSearch is based in Joondalup, which turns out to be a perfect place from which to scan the world. Company spokesman Chee Wong says the search engine offers a geographical interface to help find information in localised regions. The key difference between OpenSearch and other engines is that it offers surfers the chance to use a specialised interface to find information more efficiently. According to the company: ?We believe it's not good enough that "Infoseek found 56,456,482 pages containing the word computer'.? The interfaces include OpenSeek, GeoTour and Directories. Choice of interface depends on the nature of information sought. OpenSearch also offers online Web site creation. The basic search engine on the home page is dedicated to WA sites, and as more locals register their sites, will prove invaluable in hunting out local product. (DW)<br></font></p>
