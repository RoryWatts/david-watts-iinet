            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CYBERSPACE has become the final frontier for thousands of Star Trek fans throughout the world.<br>The cult late-night TV show seems to be mentioned in just about every second Web page visited and dominates many usenet newsgroups. The Net and Star Trek go together.<br>Yahoo Internet Life has decided to make a celebration of this - and that Star Trek is now 30 - by devoting its energies to an ultimate Trek site.<br>According to Yahoo: ?Our mission: to give away great Trek prizes, to create exciting Trek pages, to boldly go where no site has gone before.?<br>The Trek on the Net site is featuring more than a month of special events and a competition with a prize of a trip for two to Hollywood to see the new film Star Trek: First Contact.<br>Yahoo says it has scoured the Web to bring surfers what it thinks are the top 10 Trek sites. There is also an interview with Brent Spiner (Data, the android), and a reasonably serious essay trying to explain the Net-Trek special bond.<br>The essay says Star Trek fans have always had ?a keen interest in the way a world might be, for better or worse?. Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's dream was for a ?kinder, better, and more gentle world? - an idea that has appealed to generations of idealistic students.<br>?Klingons, the Borg, and Ricardo Montalban notwithstanding, the world view in Star Trek epitomises harmony between peoples and between people and machines,? Yahoo Life says.<br>?Thirty years down the road, we have computers that could kick the chips out of anything on the cheesy Enterprise bridge.<br>?The dream of the World Wide Web was, in certain ways, just a happy by-product of the larger dream of interplanetary, interspecies, pan-cultural discovery and exploration.?<br>URL: www.zdnet.com/yil/content/mag/startrek/trektoc.html<br></font></p>
