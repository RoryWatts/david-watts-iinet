            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FIVE-YEAR-OLD Queensland boy has the Internet community beating a path to his Web site. And none are more enthralled by his work than his Perth grandmother.<br>In an example of the Internet shrinking the world, Alex Balson, of the computer-literate city of Ipswich, next door to Brisbane, thinks up ideas for his Web site, father Scott puts them in play and grandmother Joan - across the Nullarbor in Sorrento - keeps in delighted touch with her family's creations through her Net connection.<br>Alex's Scribbles presents stories of Max, the Koala in Trouble, an idea which has caught the imagination of people around the world since he started in January.<br>Mr Balson said his son was bored with the Net, which he had started to surf a year ago, so thought the idea of his own site was not a bad one.<br>Alex draws storyboards for his Max the Koala series, they are scanned into the family's IBM, then Alex improves and manipulates them with Animator Pro and Npaint programs.<br>Mr Balson adds the words, converts all to HTML format and publishes the site, which is something he is pretty good at because he pioneered computer-based marketing in Perth in 1990, the year Alex was born.<br>In 1994, the Balsons moved to Ipswich where Mr Balson coordinated the city's Info-links project on the Net.<br>Former WA deputy premier Mal Bryce was responsible for Mr Balson's move and the project, which has made Ipswich a switched-on, techno-literate society. It appears to be a case of like father, like son because young Alex is certainly adept at handling his own Web site. He promises that all e-mail will be answered personally.<br>Alex's stories of Max are beautifully drawn and easy to follow, prompting people to click on parts of the drawing to move to the next screen. They have educational value for small children, particularly pre-schoolers, because a small riddle usually has to be solved before the correct part of a drawing can be clicked.<br>Accolades have poured in for Alex's Scribbles. It has been featured on cable television in the US, in a Swedish newspaper and picked as a perfect site by the American Net organisation Berit's Best Sites for Children.<br>The Australia Koala Foundation is so delighted with the site it has gone into partnership with Alex, marketing Koala in Trouble T-shirts.<br>URL: www.peg.apc.org/<br>~balson/story/<br></font></p>
