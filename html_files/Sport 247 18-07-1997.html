            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAS been a quiet week and a cold one; the perfect time to try to prove the existence of God.<br>Three little examples have helped my quest in the past seven days. They are all quite different and at least one perhaps a little ungodly. Let's start with it.<br>Last Sunday God smiled on Subiaco Oval. It may not have been apparent to the casual observer because it rained buckets and in the best wintry fashion was cold . . . cold as hell as they say.<br>But God smiled on Mick Malthouse's patched-up, bedraggled team of battling Eagles. And they did win.<br>The second piece of evidence emerged down south on Tuesday. It was sunset at Gracetown, a near perfect winter's day - light winds, light cloud, light beer. The surf was up, rolling to shore in continuous lines that stretched from one side of the bay to the other.<br>Exhausted grommets sat on their cars staring at the majesty. They had been out there among the two metre waves all day, frolicking in paradise . . . and wet suits, because it was colder than a penguin's tummy.<br>Now they watched the sun drop from behind a small white cloud on the horizon. Plop, it seemed to go as it disappeared quickly into the rolling ocean. You could almost hear it simmer as it submerged.<br>At the same time I had one ear to the car radio. The ABC handed me the next example of God on a collection plate, as it were.<br>Amid rumblings about Pauline Hanson's divisiveness was a little news item about an Anglican vicar in England.<br>Rev Alex Coker, 48, had lost his fight to take a claim of unfair dismissal to an industrial tribunal. Dr Coker, once the curate at St Philip's Church in Cheam, south-west London, was sacked in May 1994 without being given any reasons.<br>HOWEVER, the Court of Appeal has ruled that Dr Coker - indeed all clergy - are not protected by employment laws because they work for God rather than any earthly power.<br>?A minister of religion serves God and his congregation but does not serve an employer,? said Lord Justice Staughton.?There is not a contract that he will serve a terrestrial employer in the performance of his duties.?<br>So there we have it, the ultimate boss. One wonders what precedents will be set. Can workers now tell their human bosses to ?shove it? when refused a pay rise, and go to a higher power? Could Sundays be off limits again? Could Graham Kierath's various waves of industrial legislation come crashing down because he has not consulted an ultimate power?<br>All this talk of the search for God reminds me of two jokes. I presume God has a sense of humour. Why else would He have created camels, or ducks, or Pauline Hanson for that matter?<br>The first is: Did you hear about the dyslexic, agnostic insomniac?<br>He lies awake at night wondering if there is a dog.<br>The second concerns a man who dies suddenly. The bloke is a little taken aback. He did not expect to shuffle off the mortal coil so early, particularly as he has so little to show for his life.<br>But he's gone and that's that. He finds himself at the Pearly Gates in the presence of St Peter.<br>St Peter looks down on him and says: ?My son you have not much to show for yourself so I need you to perform one small, simple test to gain entrance to Heaven. You must take this footy and kick a Peter Matera-style spiral torpedo straight through the middle of the Pearly Gates 50m away.?<br>The bloke is somewhat worried. He was never a very good kick. But he has a go because the alternative is to play for the Demons . . . forever.<br>He lines up and praise be it's a beauty, bang on line. But just as the ball is about to go through the gates, a tall bearded figure leaps spectacularly and marks it.<br>?Is that God?? the bloke asks in astonishment.?Don't talk so loud, he thinks he's Gary Ablett,? replies St Peter.<br></font></p>
