            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Internet has given Singaporeans a new and exciting way of expressing themselves. But not for much longer because the Government is about to censor the Net. DAVID WATTS reports.<br>SINGAPORE embraced the technology of the Internet like few other countries just two years ago.<br>It was like a new puppy bound to grow into a faithful, obedient dog walking the information highway to economic success.<br>The island-state, led by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, encouraged people to hop on the Net and push Asian values and seek information that would benefit them.<br>But the puppy has strayed. The Net, although it offers bountiful information riches, also offers forums on sex, politics and race relations - three topics encouraged in 1950s barbershops and now the overwhelming argot of talkback radio and tabloid television.<br>But for Singapore they are not the flavour of the month and it is about to censor the Internet.<br>The topic is everywhere. The country's main newspaper, the Straits Times, had 99 articles mentioning the word Internet in the fortnight to last Tuesday.<br>Most of the articles concerned censorship and it was no surprise that, given the Straits Times is little more than a well-dressed Government mouthpiece, nearly every article was pro-censorship.<br>Communications laws passed by Parliament in 1994 included provisions for regulating computer services, and the Ministry of Information spent nearly a year researching the Net censorship guidelines announced by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority last week.<br>There was a small amount of Net regulation when it first came into use. Access providers were ordered not to connect to some sites, including those with ?alt.sex? in the address.<br>But the Government did little to prepare its people for the day they would lose nearly unrestricted access to a network linking an estimated 40 million people around the world.<br>An avid Net user interviewed by a US Internet newspaper, the Nando Times, said Singapore's restrictions on freedom of expression meant that the people had flocked to the new medium as an exciting way to express themselves.<br>Felix Ng, who uses the Net to pick up stock market tips, claimed he did not argue politics or look at naked starlets in cyberspace.<br>But even Mr Ng and other Singaporeans who will not be directly affected are unhappy at the loss of what was a refuge from the nanny state.<br>?Singapore is very much restrictive, where people cannot talk,? he said. ?So the only media we can use is the Net. If they want to curb it, we would have to keep everything to ourselves.?<br>The Government plan is intended to keep out pornography and hate literature that could incite racial and religious violence in the multi-ethnic society of four million.<br>Regulators can block Singaporean users from connecting with foreign sites the Government deems undesirable. Sites run by political parties will be licensed.<br>?A balance must be struck between free access to information and the need to maintain the values of society,? Mr Goh told a conference of South-East Asian officials.<br>Paradoxically, the Goh Government has promoted the near anarchic Internet aggressively.<br>One in three homes in Singapore has a computer, and the number of Internet accounts doubled last year to 100,000, according to the National Computer Board. It says 5 per cent to 10 per cent of Singaporeans regularly use the Internet, a participation level rivalling the US and ahead of Australia.<br></font></p>
