            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ANY company with an eye on the future has an Internet presence. The problem is many are not sure how they will make a profit in cyberspace.<br>The global population of Net users is estimated at more than 30 million and said to be capable of doubling each year for the next two or three years as technology becomes even more affordable and friendly.<br>The demographic profile that has Net users as mostly mid-30s and middle class makes the Net a rich seam to mine for companies seeking to expand. But few, unless their business is directly related to the Net, are making much out of it.<br>Crunch time looms, however, because companies now want to see a dividend for the sometimes expensive exercise of putting up sites on the World Wide Web.<br>Executives at Time-Warner, the US media giant, say the company's exhaustive Pathfinder site with its copies of Time magazine and pre-release video clips is a black hole for money. And they mean to recoup it.<br>The key trend emerging in the US - and Australia is sure to follow - is companies taking a risk.<br>The risk is no longer to offer their site as a freebie but to start making it available on subscription only, making users pay to surf there.<br>The rationale is that the Net population is big enough to guarantee audiences even with an expected drop in the number of hits at a site.<br>Publishing companies offering Net versions of newspapers and magazines are in the vanguard of this change.<br>The New York Times has expanded its Web presence to publish nearly the entire daily paper.<br>Encyclopaedia Britannica was born on the Web with a seven-day free trial but Time-Warner is planning to make Pathfinder subscription only.<br>On the other hand the Web has led to uncommon largesse by some companies.<br>The Village Voice, the famous alternative New York paper, is not only free on the Net but now free on the streets of Manhattan.<br>The Voice's Web presence attracted such a big audience that demand for the real paper and demand for advertising grew to such an extent that Voice management saw no losses in giving the paper away.<br>A Boston market research company which used to sell its reports for $400 each is now giving them away on the Web, figuring that the Web presence is luring customers to other products it has.<br>The sure-fire earners on the Net are the providers of essential services such as software, hardware and search engines.<br>Netscape, makers of the Netscape Navigator browser used by more than 80 per cent of surfers, is the biggest Net profit maker, floating last year at $US28 a share and now settled at around $US58. Fourth quarter profit last year was $US1.76 million.<br>Netscape's phenomenal success was based on an excellent product, initially given away on the Net at the right time.<br>These circumstances could be repeated, such is the explosive nature of the medium, and the race is on for investors to find a new Netscape.<br>John Robb, an analyst at Forrester Research in Massachusetts, believes investors have to look at the quality of management behind a product not just the technology.<br>Companies to have benefited so far include the premier search engines, Yahoo, Lycos, InfoSeek and Webcrawler, which make their money by helping Web surfers find things in cyberspace.<br>Advertisers who take space on a Yahoo page are thus guaranteed a big audience, whether the surfer actually clicks on the advertisement or not.<br></font></p>
