            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE greatest show on Earth will be recreated on the Web.<br>British entrepreneur Harvey Goldsmith is organising Net Aid, a massive world-wide charity concert in aid of eradicating world poverty.<br>Sir Harvey organised Live Aid in 1985, concerts by leading popular music stars that were seen by a global audience estimated at 1.5 billion.<br>Net Aid is scheduled to take place simultaneously in London, Geneva and New York on October 9. The three shows will be broadcast live on TV and on the Web. Sir Harvey has enlisted the help of the United Nations Development Fund and Internet company Cisco Systems to help organise the event.<br>Like Live Aid, performers will give their services free. Viewers will be able to pledge cash over the Net to help the United Nations' drive to eradicate world poverty by 2006.<br>Sting, a major performer in 1985, has been asked to perform, with Grammy-winner Lauryn Hill and US singers Jewel and John Mellencamp.<br>Live Aid in 1985 was held simultaneously in London and Philadelphia as a response to the famine in Ethiopia. U2 shot to world fame after the show, which also included Queen, Madonna, Elton John, Phil Collins and Eric Clapton.<br>It followed the success of the Band Aid single Do They Know It's Christmas?, which was put together by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. It raised more than $300 million for famine victims.<br>Web surfers will not find much at the Live Aid site yet, just a simple welcome message and a ?stay tuned? alert.<br>But they can relive the scope of Live Aid and Band Aid at a site built three years ago to pay tribute to the event.<br>The site is not an official production of the Band Aid Trust, but its creators call it ?merely an attempt to remind people of the great day that was Live Aid?.<br>Highlights are the memorabilia and stark reminder about poverty in the Third World.<br>The site lists the program order of bands and artists who played at Wembley and Philadelphia, and gives links to fan and official sites which showcase the performers. Some links will take surfers to sites with video clips of performers such as INXS and B.B. King.<br>HELP DESK<br>Net Aid: www.netaid.com<br>Live Aid tribute: www.herald.<br>co.uk/local-info/live-aid.html<br></font></p>
