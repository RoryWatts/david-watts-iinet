            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">You're past the stage of Web pages about your cat. You're getting interested in professional-looking pages and hot new techniques such as Dynamic HTML and Layers. But how do you go about creating attractive and compelling Web designs which will bring the punters back time and time again? Step right this way . . .<br>Have a look at the next paragraph. If it scares you, then perhaps the world of advanced HTML is not for you. If it brings on a sweaty sense of anticipation and challenge, then maybe it is time to move away from the ?this is a picture of my cat? style of home page.<br>BODY { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:9pt; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight:700; font-variant: normal; color: #330000; background-attachment: fixed; background-color: #FFFFFF; text-align: left; . . .<br>It shows two examples of the coding involved in the new and growing world of Dynamic HTML which is meant to give Web authors greater control and more flexibility.<br>The first part of the paragraph is a small sample of a Cascading Style Sheet. The second is of a Layer.<br>Unless you have Microsoft Internet Explorer 4, or Netscape Navigator 4, neither will do anything for a Web page. Browsers older than this are not programmed to make sense of these evolving HTML standards.<br>But the enthusiastic take-up of fourth-generation browsers in the Net community means more people will soon be able to make sense of dynamic pages.<br>For authors wanting to flex their creative muscle, now is an excellent time to learn. But first thingsfirst . . .<br>1: Go back to basics<br>We told would-be authors last week to spend time learning via a tutorial with either Notepad or SimpleText. Well, the message is the same even if you have created hundreds of HTML pages. And the source is exactly the same too.<br>Web Tutor not only teaches the rudiments of hypertext, it has excellent type-along lessons on tables, forms and frames.<br>All three can add to your pages if crafted wisely. For example, forms enable you to open your site for feedback and research and improve interactivity well beyond the e-mail stage.<br>Web Tutor can be downloaded to your own machine and the tutorials played very quickly from your hard drive.<br>2: Learn a bit about design<br>It is useless to have dozens of documents, images and Java applets if they are sloppily organised. Home-grown sites too often fail to appreciate there are many different computer screens trying to make sense of HTML.<br>The most basic example is screen resolution. Many people view screens set to 800 by 600 pixels, others have 640x480, whereas those with bigger monitors are liable to go for 1024x768.If your page is constructed to cover a 1024-pixel wide screen, the poor surfer with 640x480 is not going to get much of a look-in.<br>It also pays to be aware of physiology. It is generally assumed that the human eye feels most comfortable reading something no wider than 400 pixels.<br>All those pages that run from the absolute left of screen as far right as their resolution will allow are a bit hard to take.<br>This is where knowledge of table design comes in handy. In fact, knowledge of overall design is a must if you want to take the plunge into something grander.<br>One of the better sites to learn is David Walker's Lighthouse on the Web. Walker, a journalist with the Age in Melbourne, also has plenty on HTML and links to some of the better designers and best designed sites in the world. It is a comprehensive starting point.<br>3: Discover the new wave<br>The new wave is Dynamic HTML. This is a collective term covering, among other things, animation, Cascading Style Sheets, Layers and Java.<br>Bad use of any of the above is easy to find. Java can be painfully slow and often does nothing but print out little tags across screens. Animated GIFs can also be irksome unless they are clever. Too many are endless, meaningless loops.<br>However, let's be positive. If you want to learn about Java, go straight to the source at Sun Microsystems, the people who brought it to the world as a language that could make programs work on any platform when played across the Internet.<br>The Java Tutorial at Sun is easy to follow and takes surfers through step by step, enabling them to download vital tools and samples.<br>The Web giant cnet also has a good resource with its 20 Questions About Java which will give you a quick rundown.<br>Cascading Style Sheets are possibly the most exciting coding development. They look clumsy and heavyweight, but allow great flexibility.<br>A style sheet can be applied to whatever tags you like so that the body, for example, comes out as 10-point blue Arial bold on a grey background without the need for additional coding. The same goes for any tag.<br>Once you have a style sheet you have a template that cuts down the formatting needs of a page. You can also apply it to many pages so that if you want to redesign your entire site, you have to plug the changes in only once.<br>Excellent style sheet resources are available at the World Wide Web Consortium, Hotwired's Webmonkey, cnet's Builder.com and the HTML Writers' Guild.<br>Layers are almost as exciting. They enable Web authors to place content exactly where they want it to appear, not where the browser thinks it may be.<br>This is done by telling the code where a layer - which can contain text, graphics, Java, tables or anything really - should be placed in relation to the absolute left-hand corner of the screen.<br>4: The tools<br>The most exciting development in HTML authoring this year has been the beta release of Macromedia Dreamweaver. This piece of software looks unremarkable and even a bit fiddly and old-fashioned until you start poking around.<br>It is then you can see via the WYSIWYG interface how to layer a page and how to incorporate style sheets and applications like Java and Shockwave.<br>Little screen menus help you code your contents and a small HTML window can zero in on the piece of a page you want to fine-tune.<br>Dreamweaver is now up to its second beta. People have until New Year's Eve to use it for free, so take advantage. This is The Next Big Thing. Next year it is likely to cost a pretty penny (about $400) because it is so versatile.<br>Elsewhere there are many good HTML editors that can help you surf the new wave. And just as with basic HTML, Allaire Homesite is one of the best and most popular.<br>Microsoft's FrontPage 98 is promising big things with many good reviews. Remember its main purpose is as a Web server but the editor is slick and right up to date with latest hyper text developments.<br>As I said last week, there is nearly a bottomless pit of HTML software, so the Help Desk includes some of the better lists on the Web.<br>HELP DESK<br>This Help Desk is available on the Web at www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/<br>Web Tutor: junior.apk.net/ ~jbarta/tutor/makapage/index.html<br>Lighthouse on the Web: werple.net.au/ ~dwalker/front03.htm<br>20 Questions about Java: www.cnet.com/Content/Features/Techno/Java20/<br>index.html?dd<br>Java tutorial: java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html<br>Builder.com: www.cnet.com/Content/Builder/Authoring/?btb.auth<br>HTML Writers' Guild resources: www.hwg.org/resources/html/index.html<br>Style Sheets - World Wide Web Consortium: www.w3.org/Style/<br>HotWired Webmonkey: www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/stylesheets<br>Dynamic HTML sites: www.macromedia.com/support/dreamweaver/resource/websites/<br>Macromedia Dreamweaver: www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/<br>dynamic.html<br>Allaire Homesite: www.allaire.com<br>Microsoft FrontPage 98: www.microsoft.com/products/prodref/571_ov.htm<br>Download.com - Editor's top HTML editors: For Mac: www.download.com/Mac/Result/TitleList/<br>0,2,0-c-60-0-b-1,00.html<br>For PC: www.download.com/PC/Result/TitleList/<br>0,2,0-c-37-0-b-1,00.html<br>More HTML editors for PC: www.windows95.com/apps/html.html<br>Web tools for Mac: www5.zdnet.com/mac/webguide/authoring.html<br>Suffolk County: telnet://alpha2.suffolk.lib.ny.us<br>US Library of Congress: telnet://locis.loc.gov:23<br>LISWA: innopac.liswa.wa.gov.au/<br>Yahoo: www.yahoo.com.au/reference/libraries/<br></font></p>
