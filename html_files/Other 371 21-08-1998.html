            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DID you know that the strongest muscle in the body is the tongue; or that you are more likely to be killed by a champagne cork than a poisonous spider?<br>Actually I didn't know these things either and I'm not sure I really care, but I cannot resist useless trivia.<br>Like the following:<br>Thirty-six years ago this week, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr as the Beatles' drummer.<br>And 21 years ago last Tuesday, 75,000 flocked to Graceland for Elvis Presley's funeral which, coincidentally, was 21 years to the day after his version of Hound Dog entered the charts at No. 11.<br>We all know now that the funeral was premature and Elvis has been living happily with Harold Holt on Mars for some time.<br>These bits of musical trivia have far more to do with the grave news I have to impart today.<br>And that is: I believe the selectors of Australia's various teams for next month's Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur have lost the plot.<br>The games feature sports as diverse as the traditional athletics and swimming to bowls and cricket, but seem to stop short of cross-country folk-dancing.<br>The truth is Australia will again do very well, but thanks to the short-sightedness of officialdom the nation will not be able to revel properly in the triumphs.<br>We are talking here about the singing of the national anthem, Advance Australia Fair. With our team on fire this song could echo around KL up to 80 or 90 times, complete with the fascinating line ?our home is girt by sea?.<br>But because of bureaucratic incompetence we who are watching the glorious gold parade will hear the out-of-tune renditions of our athletes, just as we did in Victoria, British Columbia, four years ago and then again at Atlanta at the 1996 Olympics.<br>No one in charge has taken note of those shambles. What must be addressed for Sydney 2000 - it is too late to save KL - is the selection of vocal talent in our Games teams. Of course, the selectors must choose the best athletes too. Without them there would be no gold to sing about and no need for the singers.<br>But they should stick to those virtually assured of bringing home gold. None of this silver and bronze nonsense. Anthems are not sung for second and third.<br>Go for gold, that's the answer. Then there will be room on the plane and in the Games village for the necessary anthem singers to accompany the gold-winning athletes.<br>THIS move must start with the highest management. Therefore Ian ?Molly? Meldrum must be ranked equally with Arthur Tunstall.<br>Sure Meldrum can't sing. Then again Tunstall will not win any gold medals either . . . particularly for his Cathy Freeman jokes.<br>The lawn bowlers could be accompanied by singers suitable to their more staid and venerable image. Kamahl or Barry Crocker might just fit the bill.<br>They would add a touch of grace to the anthem for sure.<br>If unavailable, Lionel Long, Col Joye, Judy Stone or the Seekers might be tempted.<br>The swimmers who will be dripping gold need some youth and fire to match their Lycra-led, tattoo-wearing profile.<br>As I am not familiar enough with music of today, could I suggest Jimmy Barnes, Angry Anderson, the Divinyls or Yothu Yindi to do the anthem proud?<br>The track and field stars need a shade more refinement, possibly cabaret style.<br>How about John Farnham, Tina Arena and Kate Ceberano?<br>Every now and then we should throw in our crack team . . . Olivia Newton-John, Anthony Warlow and, to top it all off, the Bee Gees.<br>These selections should make the rest of the world shudder come Sydney in 2000.<br>Our home will be girt by gold.<br></font></p>
