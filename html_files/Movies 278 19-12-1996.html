            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FLY AWAY HOME ???<br>WHEN Carroll Ballard's The Black Stallion came out 17 years ago, critics and film-goers alike were thinking: Where has this guy been all our lives? The movie set standards for poetic animal imagery that no one, Ballard included, has come close to matching. Until now. Ballard, having made just one movie in the past 10 years - a gust of sailing cliches named Wind - has come roaring back with Fly Away Home. It is an enchanting big-screen poem about eccentric sculptor Thomas Alden (Jeff Daniels), his 12-year-old daughter Amy (Anna Paquin of The Piano) and the abandoned flock of geese they train to follow them from Canada to North Carolina using ultra-light (and ultra-slow) planes. Adapted extremely loosely from the experiments of Canadian artist Bill Lishman, who proved in the mid-80s that newly hatched geese will accept humans and their vehicles as parental figures to be trusted with their lives, Fly Away Home features a flock of geese, 17 in all, including one with a big heart and a game leg, which are as lovable as 17 Babes. Rated PG. (JM)<br>HOTEL DE LOVE ??<br>THIS Australian comedy starts out with a delicious premise: What would you do if your first love came back into your life? Would you attempt to win her, even if she was intent on marrying her longtime boyfriend? Hotel de Love poses this question in duplicate when twins Rick (Aidan Young) and Stephen (Simon Bossell) encounter the gorgeous Melissa (Saffron Burrows) 10 years after competing for her affections. Pushy Rick ousted his brother then, but now he is encumbered by his hippie, fortune-telling girlfriend Alison (Pippa Grandison). Unfortunately, the comedy routines in this romantic tale are so forced and unfunny that the film soon loses its way. Even veterans Ray Barrett and Julia Blake as warring parents cannot save the day. The setting of an oddball hotel where couples get married in theme rooms (such as the underwater grotto of the Grand Final room) is rather too contrived to add much to the scenario. The wonder of it all is why this film was made and heavily promoted. Rated M. (MN)<br>HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF ??<br>IT'S restrained love in the time of cholera between the exquisite Juliette Binoche and the very pretty Olivier Martinez (who it might be said is brushing up as Europe's answer to Keanu Reeves). Here Martinez is an exiled nobleman, the last of the era's gallant romantics, dashing across a plague-ridden France in 1832, fleeing assassins, befriending cats and plunging through damsels' roofs and generally behaving like a lonely but driven musketeer. By the way, he's the horseman on the roof and Binoche happens to reside under aforesaid roof. It strays from the traditional blueprint of an epic romance, which is refreshing (she's married, he's in love with at least one cause), and visually it's splendid. Chock-full of chivalry and adventures with tight corners for our odd couple. Rated M. (HC)<br>HYPE! ???<br>?WHEN the weather's crappy ... you basically feel like staying in the house and making noise to take out your frustrations,? drawls Seattle record producer Jack Endino at the beginning of Hype!, a feature-length rockumentary on the emergence of grunge music in the damp Pacific Northwest over the past decade. Despite the significance of the Seattle scene, which spawned the likes of Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, Endino's explanation is about as deep as things get in this lively, sharply photographed and edited documentary. Ignoring the greater cultural context and sticking closely to the music milieu, Hype! traces Seattle's transformation from a musical backwater to its place as what some critics are calling the San Francisco of the 90s. The film is best in dealing with the hype machine which cranked into gear when Nirvana exploded into our consciousness with their single Smells Like Teen Spirit. Within months, the plaid shirt and dank hair of the Seattle rockers went from being a sign of teen rebellion to just another million-dollar marketing image. It's no wonder Kurt Cobain got depressed. Rated M. (MN)<br>FESTIVAL OF PERTH<br>HOLLOW REED ??<br>DIRECTOR Angela Pope (Captives) and writer Paula Milne (creator of the TV series The Politician's Wife) can't be accused of shirking the tough issues - child abuse, gay parenting, the selfishness of adults, the sluggish machinery of the legal system. The problem is that they've chosen to deal with them all in a small, low-budget movie. Rather than sticking with the central and dramatically most interesting issue - why does an intelligent young mother (Joely Richardson) protect her partner (Jason Flemyng) after it's discovered he's beating her nine-year-old son Oliver? - the filmmakers toss in more ideas than a desperate politician in the last days before an election. While it's interesting to see the legal problems faced by Oliver's father (Hal Hartley vet Martin Donovan), who is a gay doctor, as he challenges for custody, in the end his sexual orientation doesn't make any difference. Still, Pope handles things with sensitivity and restraint, making lovely use of the beautiful Bath locales. Rated MA. Begins at Somerville Auditorium on Monday. Rated MA. (MN)<br>THE DAY THE SUN TURNED COLD ????<br>HONG Kong director Yim Ho keeps us guessing right to the bitter end in this China-set Oedipal drama about a young steelworker who accuses his mother of murdering his father - 10 years after the fact. Screens at Somerville until Sunday. Rated M. (MN)<br>RECENTLY OUT<br>DRAGONHEART ??<br>IT'S got the right ingredients: damn smart special effects, up-there stars Dennis Quaid and David Thewlis, a rare appearance by Julie Christie and Sean Connery as the voice of the computer-generated Draco the Dragon, a code of conduct straight from King Arthur's knightly manifesto, dungeons and tricks. But it also has a very silly plot about an old-school knight who teaches a young pale prince how to wield a sword. Daft, disarming and overall, medium-sized fun for kids. Rated M. (HC)<br>SPACE JAM ??<br>THIS is an unashamed piece of American junk culture done with flair. The over-loud, frenetic mix of animation and real life has Bugs Bunny enlisting basketball legend Michael Jordan's support to save Looney Tunes characters from life in an alien theme park. Predictable and crassly commercial, the kids will probably love it. Rated G. (DW)<br>WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE ????<br>HOW tragic can life get in junior high school when you're despised by students, teachers, parents and siblings equally, have the dress sense of a psychedelic Barbara Cartland, the face that launches a thousand jeers and attracts the type of boy whose primary interest in you is rape? An ugly duckling tale which flies in the face of stereotypical tradition, this Sundance Festival winner is irresistibly hilarious, vaguely truthful and, just occasionally, poignant. Rated M. (HC)<br>STILL ON<br>DEAD HEART ???<br>THERE are no good guys and bad guys, no right or wrong, in this tough-minded drama about a bush cop (a wonderfully gritty performance from Bryan Brown) caught between the demands of white and tribal law. Unfortunately, the film's admirable complexity tumbles into confusion as novice writer-director Nick Parsons attempts to juggle too many issues, adding sub-plots that go nowhere. Rated MA. (MN)<br>EMMA ????<br>FRESH from collaborating with Woody Allen on Bullets Over Broadway, Douglas McGrath brings humour, pace and true cinematic sensibility to Jane Austen's delightful match-making comedy of manners. The big surprise is that a writer making his directing debut should bring so much visual flair and intelligence, using purely filmic devices to capture Austen's famed irony. Rated G. (MN)<br>THE FIRST WIVES CLUB ???<br>THREE of Hollywood's classiest dames - Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Dianne Keaton - a cabal of high society wives who plot revenge on their husbands for dumping them for younger women. After a sharp, sassy beginning, Hugh Wilson's adaptation of Olivia Goldsmith's best-selling novel turns a little mushy and unbelievable, with the women setting up a crisis centre that looks more like an up-scale boutique art gallery than a place for battered wives. Rated PG. (RB)<br>JINGLE ALL THE WAY ??<br>ARNOLD Schwarzenegger is badly miscast in this exuberant Christmas comedy about a mattress store owner who fights a titanic battle for the last available Turbo Man action figure. There's some spirited slapstick but Arnie's metamorphosis into a superhero offers no surprises. Rated G. (MN)<br>JUDE ????<br>MICHAEL Winterbottom (Butterfly Kiss, Go Now) has somehow managed to freshen up that most relentlessly old-fashioned of authors Thomas Hardy with a lean, non-heritage visual and storytelling approach. He's helped by a sexy, un-Hardyish performance from Kate Winslet. Rated M. (MN)<br>MAXIMUM RISK ??<br>JEAN-CLAUDE Van Damme faces his most fearful foe yet - not the Russian mob, black and Hispanic thugs or corrupt FBI agents, but a surprisingly ambitious storyline that requires him to act. He's on much safer ground when he sticks to the teeth-rattling action, which is orchestrated by Hong Kong veteran Ringo Lam with chilling enthusiasm. Rated M. (MN)<br>101 DALMATIANS ??<br>THERE are 101 spotted pooches in this tedious remake of the much-loved 1961 Disney animated feature and not one emerges with an individual personality. Restless parents could entertain themselves with wicked thoughts of the evil Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) succeeding in turning those cute pups into a campy, high-fashion dalmatian coat. Rated G. (MN)<br>RANSOM ????<br>MEL Gibson gives a typically full-blooded performance as a hot-headed airline mogul who turns the tables on his son's kidnappers. This stylish, nerve-jangling thriller is lifted by Richard Price's tough-minded script. Rated MA. (MN)<br>SLEEPERS ???<br>BARRY Levinson's adaptation of Lorenzo Carcaterra's controversial autobiographical best-seller about a group of boys abused by predatory guards in a New York borstal will have you wondering where the truth ends and the fiction begins. Still, it's very polished and beautifully acted. Rated MA. (MN)<br>THE SPITFIRE GRILL ???<br>THIS saccharine small-town tear-jerker about a ex-con (Alison Elliott) who puts together the pieces of her shattered young life in a small Maine town will have some rushing out of the cinema and straight into the dentist's chair. What keeps us watching is the heartbreaking performance of Elliott, who manages to make even the most predictable speeches sound as fresh as a chilly Maine morning. Rated M. (MN)<br>STAR TREK ???<br>THE Borg are back - not a team of robotic tennis players but a marauding race of half-organic, half-cyborg foes first encountered in the Next Generation television series. Basically a sequel to the popular two-part episode The Best of Both Worlds, this craftily plotted, visually spectacular and surprisingly sexy second instalment of the new series of Star Trek movies revolves around the initial encounter between humankind and extraterrestrials. Rated PG. (MN)<br></font></p>
