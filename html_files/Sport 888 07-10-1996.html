            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AND now for something completely different. The AFL grand final spelt the end of a reliable and regular dose of a top-level sport on TV.<br>But it did not spell the end of all sport on the box.<br>There will be hectares of basketball as the play-offs hot up; there was Bathurst for the would-be speed demons; there will be spring and summer racing and soccer from England (ABC) and the rest of Europe (SBS) for months to come.<br>That is without mentioning a summer of cricket, tennis and golf.<br>But a little gem tucked away very late on Tuesdays on Channel 9 has always fascinated me. It used to fascinate me when it was on the ABC, too, and had the enthusiastic Don Lane as host.<br>It is the NFL, or National Football League of America to the uninitiated, and the trench warfare coupled with chess-like strategies makes compelling viewing.<br>NFL - let's call it gridiron - is as different from Australian Rules as it is possible to be while still being called a football code.<br>For the novice looking for a football fix, here are some points of difference to contemplate:<br>?To imagine the average gridiron player think of John Worsfold, add 5cm and 20kg then throw in whatever it was that made Robert ?Mad Dog? Muir so rabid in his St Kilda days. In some cases, throw in a six-figure salary.<br>?Gridiron is played in four 15 minutes quarters which take roughly three hours to complete. This is because teams can have time-outs, the broadcasters have time-outs, the clock stops when a player runs over the sideline (which happens a lot) and the physical ferocity appears to demand that the game stops more than it starts.<br>?There are many more rules than the ironically named Aussie Rules. In our footy there are really only two worth remembering - ball (holding or dropping) and too high. In gridiron there are rules governing who can catch the ball at kickoff, and even who can be on the field at certain times.<br>?The many umpires in gridiron spend about 80 per cent of the time dropping yellow hankies (for infringements of all those rules) and pointing, waving and yelling at each other.<br>?This culminates in the main umpire (who is called the referee) stopping play and telling the crowd through a microphone why. (To imagine this, think of umpire Grant Vernon stopping play at the MCG to announce: ?Charging, No.5 Geelong, free kick North.?)<br>?Despite the incredible roughness; the stop-start nature of the game and short season combine to give players a relatively long life. Many so-called rookies are older than our 23-year-old veterans like West Coast's Glen Jakovich.<br>I've been a tad hyperbolic describing some of the eccentricities, but it is a terrific TV sport because all that stop-start stuff usually doesn't make it to Channel 9 and the viewer is left with highlights of great ball skills, tremendous athleticism and unbelievable roughness.<br></font></p>
