            <h3>Author: DAVID WATTS</h3>
            <h3>Date: 23-12-1996</h3>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN 1897, the New York Sun newspaper published an editorial that has launched 1000 cliches. Reporter Francis Church was given the assignment of answering a letter from eight-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon.<br>Church turned out a piece of prose under the heading Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus and since then nearly every advertising firm and clever-dick in the world has used the phrase ?Yes Virginia, there is ...? to say that something is true.<br>For example, Yes Virginia, there is ... life after marriage ... a shop open on Christmas Day ... nothing such as a dead cert at Ascot ... it goes on.<br>But what Church wrote to Virginia is still worthy of examination 99 years later.<br>Virginia had asked if there was a Santa Claus. Some of her friends had told her he did not exist and her dad suggested writing to the Sun because, ?If you see it in the Sun, it's so?.<br>It was a long reply but here are some excerpts: ?Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the scepticism of a sceptical age. They do not believe except they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds.<br>?All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world about him ... Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist ...?<br>He concluded: ?No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.?<br>It is not yet the 1000 years from now nor the 10 times 10,000 years that Church wrote about, only 99. So how viable is his explanation to Virginia now?<br>We live in a far more sceptical age than the one Church wrote about. It is also a very cynical time, and for many a dangerous one.<br>We know that politicians lie to us, that the world's resources need more love and attention, that millions die in the mindless violence of war, that greed stalks the shopping centres, that Christ, to many, is crossed out of Christmas with an X.<br>Our children - those of Virginia's age and younger - can see much of the truth of the world just by turning on the TV at 6pm. Almost everywhere else they turn someone is trying to flog them a yo-yo, a better doll, a faster video game, cool clothes.<br>They are not as protected or innocent as they were even 20 years ago. Parents would rather drive them to school than have them negotiate streets where people with sick minds might take advantage of them. They must wear bike helmets, sun cream, rash vests, hats, shoes ... anything to ward off harm. It is a hard time. The world offers much, then appears to rear its ugly face when least expected.<br>Yet at a local carols by candlelight or a neighbourhood Christmas tree party, the children still gather and still ?ooh? and ?aah? at Santa Claus and his bag of gifts.<br>On Christmas morning, if you're still lucky enough, little feet will be heard from crazy early hours padding out to look under the tree.<br>Later, yawning a bit, little hands will still unwrap presents at the speed of sound.<br>Later still they might even give you a kiss.<br>Sentimental tosh - maybe, but Christmas still has a lot to recommend it. Even if Francis Church's words have been twisted into advertising slogans through the years, the wisdom at the heart of his editorial rings true still.<br>Merry Christmas.<br></font></p>
