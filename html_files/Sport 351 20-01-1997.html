            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AS THEY say in Melbourne every AFL season ?It's On Again?. The ?it? in question this time is the Super Bowl, America's most watched sporting event.<br>The Super Bowl is the grand final of the National Football League, the major gridiron (American football) championship. It pits the champions of the National Football Conference - this year the Green Bay Packers - against the number one team of the American Football Conference - the New England Patriots.<br>During the early 1960s there were two major American professional football leagues, the NFL and the American Football League (AFL). The first Super Bowl, held in 1967, featured the champions of these two leagues. The Packers of the NFL beat the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFL by 35-10.<br>The championship was not called the Super Bowl officially until 1970 when the two leagues merged to form today's NFL.<br>The Green Bay Packers, led by the great coach Vince Lombardi, also won the second Super Bowl in 1968. It was feared that the NFL, which included longer-established teams, would dominate for years. But the 1969 Super Bowl became one of the biggest upsets in professional football history when the New York Jets of the AFL beat the Baltimore Colts of the NFL 16-7.<br>The Colts were heavily favoured, but famous Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed that his team would win. He was as good as his word and the win helped make Super Bowl the huge affair it is now.<br>When the current NFL was formed in 1970, some former NFL sides were moved to the AFC. These teams included the Pittsburgh Steelers, who became one of the league's dominant teams during the 1970s.<br>Led by quarterback Terry Bradshaw, receiver Lynn Swann, and a powerful defence, they won the Super Bowl in 1975, 1976, 1979, and 1980.<br>The San Francisco 49ers became the NFL's most successful team during the 1980s. Star quarterback Joe Montana led them to Super Bowl victories in 1982, 1985, 1989, and 1990. The 49ers, with Steve Young calling the shots, won again in 1995.<br>During the early 1990s, Super Bowl competition was marked by four consecutive losses by the Buffalo Bills of the AFC, in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994.<br>The Dallas Cowboys emerged as one of the league's best teams, winning the 1993, 94 and 1996 Super Bowls.<br>Super facts<br>THE name Super Bowl came from Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt who became fascinated by a toy played with by his children, the "Super Ball'. He was so taken with the ball's name and liveliness, he proposed the term Super Bowl which has been used for every championship since 1970.<br>Only one Super Bowl has not been a sellout -- the first at the Los Angeles Coliseum (crowd: 61,946).<br>One footballer has played in Super Bowls in three different decades. Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw played guard for the Oakland Raiders from 1967 to 1981 and played in Super Bowls II (1968), XI (1977), and XV(1981).<br>Number 12 has been worn by starting quarterbacks in 18 different Super Bowls; 12 of them have won.<br>More than 80,000 people spent more than $165 million at Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta two years ago.<br>Nearly 3000 members of the media generate 10 million words of copy during Super Bowl week.<br>One out of every 10 US television viewers videotapes the game.<br>In 1991, for its annual production, The Road to the Super Bowl, which requires coverage throughout an entire regular season, NFL Films shot 1024km of film -- the equivalent of a show 47 days and nights long. The final show was cut to 44 minutes.<br>San Francisco police reported arrests for minor crimes dropped from an average 360 daily to 96 on the day of the Super Bowl contest with Cincinnati in 1989.<br>The Records<br>Most Games: 5 Marv Fleming, Green Bay, 1967-68; Miami, 1972-74; Larry Cole, Dallas, 1971-72, 1976, 1978-79; Cliff Harris, Dallas, 1971-72, 1976, 1978-79; Charles Haley, San Francisco, 1989-90; Dallas, 1993-94, 1996; D.D.

The half-time entertainment at the game is traditionally as extravagant as it is professional.<br>This year, with the game again in New Orleans, jazz and blues take centre stage with a show called the Blues Brothers Bash. It features the legendary James Brown, ZZ Top, John Goodman, and Dan Aykroyd and James Belushi. (Aykroyd and John Belushi were the original Blues Brothers in the cult hit film of the same name),<br>The show runs for 10 minutes and is expected to be seen worldwide by 800 million TV viewers in 160 countries.<br>Previous half-time shows have featured:<br>Super Bowl I, University of Arizona and University of Michigan Bands; IV Mardi Gras and Carol Channing; VI Salute to Louis Armstrong; IX Tribute to Duke Ellington: XI Walt Disney Productions; XIX US Air Force; XXII Radio City Productions Something Grand with Chubby Checker and the Rockettes; XXVII Radio City Productions Heal The World with Michael Jackson; XXX Radio City Productions and Diana Ross.<br>The Winners<br>1967: Green Bay 35 d Kansas City 10, Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles (crowd: 61,946)<br>1968: Green Bay 33 d Oakland 14, Orange Bowl, Miami (75,546)<br>1969: NY Jets 16 d Baltimore 7, Orange Bowl, Miami (75,389)<br>1970: Kansas City 23 d Minnesota 7, Tulane Stadium, New Orleans (80,562)<br>1971: Baltimore 16 d Dallas 13, Orange Bowl, Miami (79,204)<br>1972: Dallas 24 d Miami 3, Tulane Stadium, New Orleans (81,023)<br>1973: Miami 14 d Washington 7, Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles (90,182)<br>1974: Miami 24 d Minnesota 7, Rice Stadium, Houston (71,882)<br>1975: Pittsburgh 16 d Minnesota 6, Tulane Stadium, New Orleans (80,997)<br>1976: Pittsburgh 21 d Dallas 17, Orange Bowl, Miami (80,187)<br>1977: Oakland 32 d Minnesota 14, Rose Bowl, Pasadena (103,438)<br>1978: Dallas 27 d Denver 10, Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans (75,583)<br>1979: Pittsburgh 35 d Dallas 31, Orange Bowl, Miami (79,484)<br>1980: Pittsburgh 31 d Los Angeles 19, Rose Bowl, Pasadena (103,985)<br>1981: Oakland 27 d Philadelphia 10, Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans (76,135)<br>1982: San Francisco 26 d Cincinnati 21, Pontiac Silverdome, Pontiac (81,270)<br>1983: Washington 27 d Miami 17, Rose Bowl, Pasadena (103,667)<br>1984: LA Raiders 38 d Washington 9, Tampa Stadium, Tampa (72,920)<br>1985: San Francisco 38 d Miami 16, Stanford Stadium, Stanford (84,059)<br>1986: Chicago 46 d New England 10, Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans (73,818)<br>1987: NY Giants 39 d Denver 20, Rose Bowl, Pasadena (101,063)<br>1988: Washington 42 d Denver 10, Jack Murphy Stadium, San Diego (73,302)<br>1989: San Francisco 20 d Cincinnati 16, Joe Robbie Stadium, Miami (75,129)<br>1990: San Francisco 55 d Denver 10, Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans (72,919)<br>1991: NY Giants 20 d Buffalo 19, Tampa Stadium, Tampa (73,813)<br>1992: Washington 37 d Buffalo 24, Metrodome, Minneapolis (63,130)<br>1993: Dallas 52 d Buffalo 17, Rose Bowl, Pasadena (98,374)<br>1994: Dallas 30 d Buffalo 13, Georgia Dome, Atlanta (72,817)<br>1995: San Francisco 49 d San Diego 26, Joe Robbie Stadium, Miami (74,107)<br>1996: Dallas 27 d Pittsburgh 17, Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe (76,347)<br>Most Valuable Players<br>Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr was MVP in the first two Super Bowls.
