            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS possible to go overboard about the Internet. It has so much to offer.<br>Last Saturday afternoon, easily 30 minutes before the television news made its pronouncements, Yes-voting Web users were able to wail ?No? at the updated results at the Australian Electoral Commission Referendum site.<br>They were even able to note with surprise how the silvertail voters of Kooyong supported the republic model in almost exactly the same numbers as the blue-collar people of Melbourne Ports.<br>Earlier in the week they could have got the latest on the Melbourne Cup with The West Australian's own TABform Online.<br>They could have had a cyber-wager with Alice Springs bookmaker Centrebet, which took close to $1 million on the race.<br>If they went to the reborn Britannica.com for free use of the Rolls-Royce of encyclopedias they might have been tempted to pursue the invitation to pre-order the new CD 2000 version for about $100.<br>Then, as they went to enter their credit card details at the check-out page, they would have wished they had kept their eyes on the fine print when they noticed this bargain was for US and Canadian buyers only.<br>And therein lies a tale. Yes, it is possible to go overboard about the joys of the Net, but it pays to remember it is still in a ?wild west? state of development.<br>This is particularly so with e-commerce. The Net has been a shopping tool for virtually five minutes, after all.<br>Evidence of just how raw the medium is might be found in the fact that the biggest revenue generator is still pornography. According to a Melbourne Age report on Saturday, more than 10,000 new sex sites are going up every week.<br>Away from the porn scene, it is often assumed that shopping online with big, established firms is the safe way to go.<br>A 54-year-old Perth man e-mailed me a couple of weeks ago to tell me that is not always the case.<br>He told a tale of woe that started last May, with an online order from a prominent US firm for a soundcard.<br>IT ENDED only last week when the furious online shopper was forced to e-mail a picture of a gold credit card to reclaim money lost by receiving faulty goods from overseas.<br>In between was a tragedy of unanswered e-mails and faxes, unanswered international phone calls and bills for customs, tax and courier charges.<br>?You'd be surprised just how many people have been screwed and just given up,? he said. ?We are talking here about ... getting the business from big business.?<br>His story arrived only days before a www.consult report that pointed out serious problems in e-commerce with 75 per cent of online shoppers abandoning their virtual shopping carts before getting to the check-out page because they were not sure how much they were spending. And then the Financial Times filed a report saying that Internet shoppers suffer from misleading marketing on many leading Web sites.<br>It is still a wonderful medium for all that.<br>But the words ?buyer beware? have never been more apt.<br></font></p>
