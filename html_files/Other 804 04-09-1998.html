            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE past week has been a nightmare. It is not because of the Eagles' poor finish to the football season.<br>I can cope with that. It took only two people to talk me out of jumping off the Narrows Bridge. And the doctors say that if I keep taking the tablets I could be out of here by the start of the Ansett Cup pre-<br>season matches next year.<br>What has been ailing me is this stupid song that keeps going round my head. I heard it a week ago when the taxi I was in had the radio tuned to the station that plays only music from the 60s and 70s, 6IX I think (it's been a while since I really cared about radio stations - the kids dominate the airwaves at our place).<br>Anyway the radio was playing Elusive Butterfly, a song I had not heard in at least 25 years. Now I know why I haven't heard it . . . it's nauseating, moronic and a dreadful drone when it won't get out of your head.<br>Sorry to do this, but if you don't know the song, here are the opening lines:<br>You might wake up some mornin'<br>To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind<br>And if you're quick enough to rise<br>You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow<br>Out on the new horizon<br>You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings<br>Now I realise that the rendering of those painful words has probably infected some<br>of you with the ?music goes round my head? virus. For that I apologise.<br>In the old days when men said they had a song going round in their heads, people would reply that they should get rid of their hat band. In these days of baseball caps that advice loses a lot of its appeal.<br>But I really needed to get those words out as some sort of purging process. The other way to nail this song and free it from my aching brain is to know as much as possible about it, come to terms with it and free myself from its mysteries . . . as well as its awful tune.<br>Originally I was prepared to blame Elusive Butterfly on Bobby Goldsboro. It is very easy to blame bad songs on him because he sang so many.<br>Can you ever forgive him for Honey, Watching Scotty Grow or See the Funny Little Clown?<br>But Elusive Butterfly is not his fault. I called my ancient schoolfriend, Thomo, in Queensland. Nicknamed the Nostalgic Gnome, Thomo still has all the Top 40 charts from 1967, 68 and 69, all the great 45s, and still hums Sky Pilot.<br>He wasn't any help at all and rather than answering the question, challenged me to name who sang Hickory Holler's Tramp. It was O.C. Smith, Thomo. Now sod off.<br>But after some hours I tracked down the neutraliser of my neurones. It was an American named Bob Lind who sang one of thousands of one-hit wonders from the 60s and 70s.<br>ELUSIVE Butterfly made it to number 5 on the US Billboard charts in 1966. Which only goes to show what appalling taste people had back then. After all this was the time when drivers were lamenting the replacement of the HD Holden and its killer front fins with the more sedate HR.<br>Lind recorded three songs along with Elusive Butterfly in 1966, and liked the Butterfly saga least. His recording company, however, seemed to be full of characters with dubious taste, or drug-takers, or devil-worshippers, you name your favourite sin. Anyway they unleashed Elusive Butterfly on the world.<br>It came, it went and then lay dormant in the radio of my taxi until it suspected that the aching head of a passenger - aka, me - would be fertile ground for a nauseating fling.<br>The other way to drive it off is to inject another song in there. But all I can think of at the moment is the Adelaide Crows theme song, We're the Pride of South Australia.<br>I'm not that desperate . . . yet.<br></font></p>
