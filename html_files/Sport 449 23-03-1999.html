            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FOOTBALL is a tough, serious game isn't it? The players, in what promises to be another even season, are the stars that the public wants to see and hear about, aren't they?<br>Why is it, then, that so much of the AFL coverage about to hit us is based on blokes making jokes?<br>Certainly most aspects of life can do with a bit of humour. Italian film-maker Roberto Benigni even found that light-hearted optimism in the face of the monstrosities of the Holocaust paid off, winning two Oscars for his Life Is Beautiful.<br>But funny business and overflowing commentary boxes seem to be the dominant themes behind TV's handling of the AFL.<br>It began on Seven on Sunday with Basil's Footy Show, in which Basil Zempilas and Adrian Barich did a skit called the Dudd Couple.<br>They giggled their way through some schoolboy stuff about trying to start a third AFL team in WA. During the skit Barich remarked that the duo had no credibility. This could come back to haunt the boys. Do we viewers take their assessments of football seriously after they set themselves up as a comedy act?<br>Granted, they do not take their humour seriously, if that can be said, but will we be able to take their seriousness seriously?<br>Tomorrow night, the blokes and jokes are wall-to-wall. And there may even be some serious football talked when Nine is forced to throw the Footy Show on a day and an hour earlier than normal because Seven has the opening match of the season on Thursday night.<br>Eddie McGuire, Sam Newman and the usual suspects will find out how popular their show really is when its second half runs up against Seven's Live and Kicking from 9.30pm.<br>When coverage of the games gets under way on Thursday night, Seven is promising a commentary team made up of Bruce McAvaney, Ian Robertson, Jason Dunstall, John Russo and Robert Dipierdomenico.<br>On Sunday, Sportsworld Footy Panel presented by ?the inimitable Rex Hunt and Bob Davis? (Seven's words) will try to make sense of the opening round - in between exchanges of insults among old players.<br>A delayed telecast of the western derby caps off week one.<br>For those new to the AFL, the players will be the ones busting their guts on the playing field in between commercial breaks.<br></font></p>
