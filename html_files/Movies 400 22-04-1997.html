            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Trigger Happy (M)<br>Jeff Goldblum, Richard Dreyfuss<br>Directed by Larry Bishop<br>? ? ? ½<br>A LOT of people are not going to like Trigger Happy, a strange gangster-movie spoof. If you haven't got a quirky dark sense of humour or are not influenced by alcohol or drugs, it could be an irritating film.<br>However, Trigger Happy may build up a cult following for its very oddness when it reaches video stores.<br>First-time director Larry Bishop is the son of comic-actor Joey, who was a minor figure in what was known as the Rat Pack back in the early 1960s. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis jun. and Peter Lawford were the leaders of the pack and made blokey films such as Ocean's Eleven and Robin and the Seven Hoods.<br>All this has rubbed off on Larry, who, apart from some bikie films, hasn't made the big time in Hollywood. But as well as his Rat Pack upbringing, he attended Beverly Hills High with Richard Dreyfuss and Rob Reiner.<br>Nine years ago Bishop conceived Trigger Happy, but it has only made it to screen now because Dreyfuss agreed to produce it.<br>The central theme is madness - true, barking dog-type looniness - and death by shooting, which is the inevitable result of that madness. Trigger Happy does not take place in any sort of real world. It is stylishly set in a parallel universe where life is spent in nightclubs and bars, men dressed in black suits, women in revealing slinky dresses.<br>There are no police, children, wives or girlfriends in the conventional sense. There are no rules.<br>In this world, gangland boss Vic (Dreyfuss) is about to be released from the mental hospital. While he's been detained, his two main lieutenants have looked after his affairs.<br>Ben London (a brilliantly funny Gabriel Byrne of The Usual Suspects) has been running the organisation, while Mickey Holliday (Jeff Goldblum) has been running around with Vic's girl, Grace Everly (Diane Lane).<br>A gang war is breaking out. The ambitious Jake Parker (a restrained Kyle MacLachlan of Twin Peaks fame) is trying to take over the turf with hired guns Lee Turner (Billy Idol, on screen about a minute) and Nick Falco (Christopher Jones, unseen since Ryan's Daughter).<br>But all Vic really cares about is getting Grace back - which would also please Grace's sister Rita (Ellen Barkin in good gangster moll form), who loves Mickey.<br>Vic seems sanest of all these, even though he's been the one institutionalised. Perhaps the fact he is the only crim to wear white signals his oddness. The rest of the crazies murder each other regularly and with great enjoyment, but with little blood.<br>A little like Robert Altman's The Player, audiences can spend an engrossing time picking the stars. Yes, that's Michael Pollard, the little man from Bonnie and Clyde. He dies within the first few minutes.<br>And there is Gregory Hines. And Burt Reynolds, Henry Silva, an original Rat Packer, Rob Reiner, Larry Bishop's classmate, the director himself, one line from dad Joey Bishop, a fleeting turn on his wheelchair from Richard Pryor; then there is Paul Anka in a mad duo with Byrne, singing My Way.<br>In the background you can hear some Rat Pack hits. Sinatra's I've Got the World on a String, Sammy Davis's Something's Gotta Give and the Dean Martin hits C'est Si Bon and Welcome to My World add more odd character to this handsome, idiosyncratic film.<br></font></p>
