            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WEB sites and selections of help desks and columns are available on the web at www.iinet.net.au/~watto/access/access.html<br>Readers can submit sites they think worthy of mention via e-mail to access@wanews.com.au or watto@iinet.net.au<br>SPORT<br>Norwich Rising Star (AFL)<br>www.norwich.com.au/risingst/index.html<br>AFL players look alarmingly young these days. And with good reason .. . many of them are.<br>The Norwich Union Financial Services Group, with the weekly nomination for the AFL Norwich Rising Star, recognises the impact of players under 21 and with fewer than 10 games under their belt at the start of the season.<br>At the end of each season the top overall young star is named as the year's rising star. This site has profiles on all the annual winners, starting with inaugural victor Nathan Buckley, then with Brisbane but now with Collingwood. West Coast heart-throb Ben Cousins was the 1996 recipient.<br>The site is updated weekly. Michael Braun of the Eagles and Jess Sinclair of the Dockers have provided the WA interest so far.<br>Tour de France (cycling)<br>www.letour.com/98us/<br>A DRUG scandal is enveloping this year's Tour de France, which ends next Saturday.<br>When you look at the official web site you will be surprised that not everyone is on something. The graphic-intensive site includes profiles of the mountainous conditions the cyclists have to conquer each day. It is exhausting just to look at.<br>Riders jot down their impressions in a daily diary and there is an online shop so you can browse through the slick merchandise of cycling.<br>NOBEL PRIZE<br>The Nobel Channel<br>www.nobelchannel.com<br>A SECONDARY window at the Nobel Channel warns that the site is best viewed with a minimum 56K connection and that 128K is better.<br>But don't let that put you off. Browsing with an ordinary 28.8K connection still delivers an entertaining and educational experience.<br>The channel is not big on the history of the Nobel Prize but rather seeks to educate surfers on the benefits that have arisen since the inception of the prizes for peace, medicine, chemistry, physics, economics and literature 97 years ago.<br>RealPlayer and Shockwave plug-ins are a must to experience the full multi-media capabilities. And there are dozens of external links to sites dealing with prizewinners and the biography of the award benefactor Alfred Nobel.<br>GEOGRAPHY<br>Microsoft TerraServer<br>www.terraserver.microsoft.com/default.html<br>IF you doubted that Microsoft wants to dominate the world, look no further than this TerraServer site. It is a huge database of satellite images of parts of the Earth.<br>Surfers can keep zooming in on an image until they are basically in someone's backyard. That backyard will most probably be in the US at this early stage of development. But other countries will topple ... mark my words.<br>BOOKS<br>The Modern Library - Top 100 novels<br>www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/<br>THE Modern Library Board has sparked controversy with its selection of the top 100 novels of the century.<br>No Lord of the Rings, few Brits and so on. But the publishers behind the listing, Randomhouse, is using this web site to give the public its say.<br>The voting process is not that democratic. You can select your choice for top novel as many times as you want. This very web way of doing things may have something to do with the way readers' choices were going last week. On top was Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. The Fountainhead, by the same author, was at number five. But at least Lord of the Rings had made it to number four.<br></font></p>
