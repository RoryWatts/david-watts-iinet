            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TIMED business data calls have Australia's Net community in uproar.<br>No issue has caused such an outcry in the short history of the medium.<br>And few issues have been the catalyst for so many protest sites.<br>The Senate passed the Telstra Bills two days before Easter. The Bills allow part-privatisation of the communications giant and stipulate how Telstra can act after July 1.<br>The electronic uproar is caused by the failure of the Bills to guarantee untimed local calls for business data. Some sites on the Web declare timed business data calls will kill the Net here.<br>Fear of timed calls and a perception that Telstra wants to dominate the ISP business have been visible on the Web since last year when freelance telecommunications writer Stewart Fist unearthed a Telstra document declaring Net business domination as its aim.<br>Fear resurfaced earlier this year when Telstra executives told the Senate committee on part-privatisation they needed timed calls to counter congestion they claimed was caused by growing Net use.<br>The resulting uproar was loud and Communications Minister Richard Alston stopped the introduction of timed business and household voice calls and household data calls.<br>But that uproar is small compared with the present one.<br>Sites range from considered and studious to outraged and disrespectful.<br>The most important at the moment is the online petition begun on Easter Thursday by the newly formed Australian Internet Alliance, a grouping of about 100 small ISPs.<br>The petition has collected names at the rate of 100 an hour and is to be presented to the Senate by Democrat technology spokesman Natasha Stott Despoja.<br>Initial fears that the petition was invalid because it had no handwritten signatures were thrown aside by Senator Stott Despoja.<br>People needing background on the timed calls issue have an impressive array of sites to consult. A short list includes:<br>? The Senate report on the legislation.<br>? The debates from Hansard.<br>? Telstra arguments for timing.<br>? US reports dismissing congestion worries.<br>? Explanations of how telephone networks work.<br>? Government telecommunications policies.<br>Several sites have grouped all these resources. One of the most impressive is run by Mark Nottingham and tells how to contact politicians and offers mailing lists to receive updates on the issue.<br></font></p>
