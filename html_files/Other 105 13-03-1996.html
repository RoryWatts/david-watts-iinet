            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PAUL KEATING was still Prime Minister of Australia yesterday.<br>His policies, speeches and picture - albeit as a fresh-faced youngster - were alive and well on the Internet.<br>The Office of Government Information and Advertising, responsible for Australia's Federal presence on the World Wide Web, had been promising to update the information about our new leaders for six days.<br>But the size of the coalition election landslide and the scope of electronic change obviously has been too much for their Internet staff of one and a consultant.<br>All official pages about Government departments were supposed to change on Monday to reflect the Howard ascendancy. New pictures of Alexander Downer, Peter Costello and Tim Fischer were supposed to oust those of Gareth Evans, Ralph Willis and Kim Beazley.<br>But they didn't.<br>In a bid to tell the global Internet community that we were under new management, the OGIA last week wiped its Web pointer to Government departments.<br>Net users looking for departmental policies, initiatives and media releases were told from Thursday: ?Information unavailable pending the appointment of the new Government?.<br>In a true lose-lose scenario, the OGIA has not only failed to keep pace with reality, but has been attacked for wiping pointers to information on the old government ahead of time.<br>Academics from throughout the country used an e-mail subscription list called Link to brand the OGIA's wiping of the official global pointer as electronic shredding and an attempt to rewrite history.<br>Tony Barry, of the Centre for Networked Information and Publishing in Canberra, said: ?The press statements of any government are part of the historical record and, where they announce government action, any administrative matters remain valid until there are changes made by later governments.<br>?To take them down is to try to rewrite history. This is very silly at the very least.?<br>The OGIA's official pointer led nowhere but avid Net users could use back doors to find government information.<br>Access via the National Library's Web site and the Labor Party's site led straight to the Prime Minister ... Mr Keating.<br></font></p>
