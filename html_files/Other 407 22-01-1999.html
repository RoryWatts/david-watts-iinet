            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS heat is enough to drive a man to drink. Much as I would like to do some practical research into that claim, I am afraid I am bound by the politically correct strictures of modern times.<br>That is: I cannot go out, drink until I can no longer talk, then come back to the computer and write a column starting with the words ?I'm as skunk as a drunk and here ish what happens when you've had more to think then you drink you have, hic.?<br>No, can't do that these days. How fondly I remember my early days in newspapers, before the dark clouds of booze buses, health fanatics and tut-tutters.<br>In 1975 I was given a dream assignment by my country daily. ?David, there is a beer strike. Find out how it's affecting the town.?<br>Whacko. I found my mate Thomo and we proceeded to do research into the beer strike by going on a pub crawl. The town had 15 pubs so we decided not to be greedy and have only two middies at each pub.<br>By the eighth pub, we had quite forgotten why we were on a pub crawl and decided to stay in the lounge bar for the weekly cabaret.<br>After an hour, the barmaid said the pub had run out of beer and we were forced to change to rum. ?Why ishn't there any beer?? I asked. ?Because there's a beer strike,? said the barmaid. ?Geez, stuff like that should be in the paper. Waddya reckon Thomo?? I said.<br>Thomo looked up from his glass and said: ?I'm good with beer. I know when I've had enough.?<br>He promptly fell off his bar stool and muttered: ?I've had enough.?<br>As hard as it might be to believe, I did file a report on the beer strike for the next day's paper, although some of the more emotive content was edited out.<br>The words ?there's no bloody beer?, ?don't panic? and ?still plenty of good rum? failed to make it.<br>Ah, the good, old days. You cannot do research like that any more, so I had to rely on the Internet.<br>Here I found a site written by a man from Ecuador in both Spanish and English which presented the surprising fact that more than 99 per cent of dead people have been found to have drunk water; whereas only 64 per cent had been found to have consumed alcohol.<br>The site then went on to examine some common problems experienced while drinking, and offered solutions.<br>For example:<br>Problem - Drinking fails to give taste and satisfaction, beer is unusually pale and clear.<br>Probable cause - Glass empty.<br>Suggested action - Find someone who will buy you another beer.<br>Or:<br>Problem - Drinking fails to give taste and satisfaction, and the front of your shirt is wet.<br>Cause - Mouth not open when drinking or glass applied to wrong part of face.<br>Action - Buy another beer and practise in front of mirror. Drink as many as needed to perfect drinking technique.<br>And we must not forget the impression alcohol has made on some great minds (and many not so great) through the ages:<br>Always remember that I have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me - Winston Churchill.<br>A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her - WC Fields.<br>Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy - Benjamin Franklin.<br>You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on - Dean Martin.<br>I'll drink to those.<br></font></p>
