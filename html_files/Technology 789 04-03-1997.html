            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MY COMPUTER and Windows95 celebrated their first anniversary last week. Somehow they managed to stay together.<br>It has been a rocky relationship and there have been periods of separation. The computer's old suitor, Windows3.1, has had to move back in more than once.<br>But I've learnt to reformat a hard drive and re-install everything I need in a shade under four hours ... so that's a slight compensation.<br>To start at the beginning: the computer was an IPC ValueMagic with a 486 DX4/100 processor, 8MB of RAM and a 540MB disk. It didn't start the day it was installed in July 1995.<br>But a week or so later, an hour before IPC announced it was closing retail outlets in WA, we took delivery of a PC that worked.<br>Within a month it needed a new CD-Rom drive, but apart from that no real worries. It chugged along with Win3.1.<br>But after gliding through computer store after computer store, and listening to the cyber-hype of Internet users with 32-bit connections, Java and multi-tasking, I just had to have a Start button. So I parted with $159 at Dick Smith's in William Street and cast Win3.1 aside.<br>The marriage started well. Win95 was happy on the IPC and the IPC did not complain.<br>But when I hooked up to the Net a cloud no bigger than a man's hand started to hover.<br>Win95's hardware detection could not find a modem for hours. I finally told it that I had a new one and to install it. With much agonising it did and I connected to the Net and downloaded 32-bit Netscape, Eudora, Free Agent and Cute FTP.<br>None worked. Many messages, faxes, emails to IPC in Singapore (never answered) and mumblings over beers to mates followed before it was learnt the IPC had a soundcard and inbuilt modem - called a T-32 card - which did not want to have anything to do with 32-bits.<br>In May the soundcard crashed. To use a technical expression, it packed it in; wouldn't make a peep. With it went the modem and CD-Rom drive which were built in.<br>About $750 later my IPC emerged with a Creative Soundblaster soundcard and CD-Rom plus a Netcomm Roadster modem.<br>The next two months were happy. The IPC and Win95 chirped cheerfully.<br>But in early August the dark cloud that seemed to have disappeared reared again, bigger and uglier than before.<br>Three or four times a day the IPC would just stop as Win95 flashed a blue screen saying Fatal Exception Error.<br>I put in another 8MB of RAM, believing that memory was all Win95 wanted.<br>The 16MB of RAM just made the system crash faster. Another reformat and reinstall. This time happiness prevailed for just one month.<br>Through November and December I reinstalled Win95 almost weekly.<br>On New Year's Day with the temperature roasting at over 40C and friends relaxing in pools, I reformatted and installed once again ... reliable Win3.1 was back. A month of stability and I got the crazy urge to reinstall Win95. Win3.1 might be a steady old system, but it makes you feel like you need a chimney coming out of the PC.<br>This time Win95 held for a week. Then blue screens and total stops forced me to do what I'd suspected for months. I had a new motherboard, Pentium 133, graphics card and extra 8MB of RAM installed.<br>Now the IPC and Win95 are truly happy. I'm another $660 poorer ... the price of peace and progress.<br>In retrospect ...<br>Use computers and computer components with proved track records.<br>The more RAM the better. Microsoft says on the Win95 pack that it will operate with 4MB. This is very optimistic. Try 16MB to get near a guarantee of stability.<br>The newer and faster the processor the better. Again, Win95 will work on a 486, but thankfully Pentium 133 or 166 with 16MB RAM is now standard for new systems.<br>Backup the system registry regularly (the Win95 handbook tells how).<br>Do regular virus scans.<br>Perform scandisk and defrag weekly.<br>Backup important data. If you are a regular Net user, back up your bookmarks and mailboxes.<br>Find people you trust who are computer-savvy enough to advise you.<br>Don't be frightened to ask for help.<br>Useful URLs on the Web: Windows95 Annoyances - www.creativelement.com/win95ann/<br>Microsoft - www.microsoft.com.au (the Knowledge Base can be helpful)<br>Windows95 software - www.windows95.com<br>Newsgroup - alt.windows95<br></font></p>
