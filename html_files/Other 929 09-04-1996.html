            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A YOUNG German backpacker has used the Internet to try to track down a Perth couple who befriended him and his partner in Yanchep last year.<br>Peter Reinhart, of Thalmassing, near Nuremberg, trekked around WA in a campervan in January 1995. He and partner Marion stopped at Yanchep lagoon and met a Perth couple who put them up for the night in their weekender.<br>The couple showed Mr Reinhart the delights of WA wildlife, including a mob of kangaroos at sunset.<br>The couples exchanged addresses but Mr Reinhart lost the Perth couple's details during wild weather in Germany late last year.<br>Determined to make contact with people who had gone out of their way to make their stay in WA pleasant, Mr Reinhart used Internet e-mail to find out who in WA could help him.<br>He tracked down my e-mail address and sent me a photograph of the Perth couple by more traditional means.<br>He would like the couple to contact him at Speihackerstrasse 6, 93107 Thalmassing, Germany.<br></font></p>
