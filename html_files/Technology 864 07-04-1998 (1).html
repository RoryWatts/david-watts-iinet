            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Digital television is a headache, and it is not even here yet. Even the mildly technical will find their heads start to spin when they think of the ramifications possible with signals beaming through enhanced broadcast space.<br>Wouldn't it be great to have multi-channels with sport on one, movies on another, Internet access on a third and normal fare on still another? Wouldn't it be great to be able to receive news services tailored to your tastes on your TV screen and then click on aspects of a story for historical background, political facts and dozens of other bits of information that could be sent?<br>Wouldn't it be great to find a wide variety of news and current affairs sources, and not depend on A Current Affair or Today Tonight for their myopic views?<br>Well it is not going to happen, not for 10 years at least. Australia will have the same, old TV, albeit in startling quality. This means you will be able to see all those American sitcoms, so irrelevant to your lifestyle, in brilliant clarity.<br>And you probably will have access to some Internet services, but they will very likely be controlled by the Kerrys Packer and Stokes. And that in itself is a headache. Does that mean the Web will become a more widely spread but more limited medium, offering resources pertinent only to network TV's menu? Will the most enthralling prospect be being able to read ?character? biographies of the cast of Home and Away? And those are questions raised by the broad issue of freedom to information only.<br>What about more bread and butter stuff?<br>Should you wait three years to buy a new digital TV set, or should you plough on and buy a cheaper analogue model, then pay for a set-top box that will unscramble the signal?<br>Will you need a new VCR to make sense of the digital signal? And will that VCR play back your old analogue tapes? Should you invest in DVD discs and players now?<br>How many shows will be made using digital technology in the first few years of transmission? Will those made by older methods, or the mountains of repeats, be any better on a digital set than they are now on analogue?Should you put the PC in mothballs and wait for super-fast Internet access on your TV, possibly courtesy of a Microsoft-controlled outfit like WebTV? Or should it be the TV that is junked in favour of a card that will allow your PC to receive TV signals?<br>The questions go on, but the answers remain unclear even after checking the dozens of resources about digital TV available on the Web.A reasonable starting point is the Federal Department of Communications, which has an FAQ (list of frequently asked questions) at its site. A long list of questions and answers deals with issues such as the difference between analogue and digital; what consumers will need; explanations of datacasting, and the possibility of new players in the market.<br>A wider variety of views is on show at Digital Television Australia, the creation of a University of Wollongong student. It is an excellent resource with dozens of links to digital TV sites around the world and a thorough index of recent news reports about the issue. You will find links to USA Today's Digital TV: An Uncertain Future, the Fairfax organisation's views on the need for greater diversity in the market, and the Internet Industry Association pleas for far broader use of the digital spectrum.<br>An Australian Financial Review editorial entitled Information Age Mockery will get the brain cells racing, as will The West Australian's editorial on the topic.<br>And if you don't come away with a general feeling of unease at the Federal Government's sacrifice of a national resource like airwaves, then you are made of sterner stuff than me.<br>HELP DESK<br>Digital TV FAQ: www.dca.gov.au/mediarel/98/digitalqa.htmlDigital Television Australia: www.zip.com.au/ ~quokka/features/<br>dttb.html<br>Digital TV: An Uncertain Future: www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/<br>ctbon001.htmFairfax views: www.fairfax.com.au/submission/Internet Industry Association views: www.iia.net.au/news/980301.html.Information Age Mockery: www.afr.com.au/content/980325/<br>editorial.html<br>Editorial from The West Australian: www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/access/digtv.html<br></font></p>
