            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A SURVEY of Internet use in WA demolishes the image of nerdy, pimple-prone geeks hunched over keyboards.<br>Access provider iiNet Technologies did an online survey late last year. Of 286 respondents, 27 per cent were aged 30-40 and 25 per cent 40-50.<br>The age group commonly thought to be the most computer literate - 18-25-year-olds - comprised only 18 per cent of those surveyed.<br>The testosterone factor was immense with a male-female ratio of 91 per cent to 9 per cent.<br>Nearly half of the users operated with Windows, 35 per cent with Windows 95, 7 per cent had Macs and 4 per cent used the once-favoured Unix.<br>More than half (51 per cent) rated the World Wide Web as their main Net use, 27 per cent said e-mail and 11 per cent said newsgroups. Only 3 per cent rated relay chat as their main use - the same number as File Transfer Protocol users.<br>Connection speed was rated the biggest problem by 44 per cent.<br></font></p>
