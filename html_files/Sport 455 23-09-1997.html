            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS time next week it will all be a memory ... not just the football but the words the commentators use to describe it.<br>It is hard to imagine but armchair experts are about to go nearly six months without hearing the phrase ?hard at the ball?.<br>Cricket will not benefit from these words, though it is possible that an excitable Bill Lawry or Tony Greig might pull them out to describe a fieldsman desperately cutting off a four.<br>Jack Newton is unlikely to utter them even when Greg Norman unleashes a mighty drive off the tee.<br>And Peter Landy will probably refrain even when Mark Philippoussis serves at 220kmh.<br>Hard at the ball would have to be the most used expression during all 600 hours of AFL shown by Channel 7 this season.<br>It has replaced ?desperate? as the way to describe the pursuit of the pill.<br>It certainly is more accurate and descriptive, though becoming jaded.<br>When I hear it, it always brings up an image of a dog chasing a stick or a ball.<br>Few things could go harder than that, unless you count the other type of dog, the South Fremantle Bulldogs as they clawed their way to an exciting Westar Rules premiership.<br>The Bulldogs' six-point win over East Fremantle, shown on ABC, was such a nail-biter it nearly caused Wally Foreman to lose his voice, and possibly his sense of grammar.<br>With the scores tied and more than 25 minutes gone in the final quarter, Foreman croaked: ?If South win this it will make John Todd the most winningest coach of all.?<br>The footy commentator's lot is a hard one. Clashes like the Westar grand final and Saturday's Adelaide-Western Bulldogs classic force even the most stoic to extremes.<br>Some are extreme even when games are patchy and dull.<br>I for one will not miss Sandy Roberts bellowing ?kick a goal Nicky (or whoever)?. Nor will I miss Kevin Bartlett's flat lament: ?Pass is a poor one?. Or his sudden surge of excitement whenever Fremantle's Winston Abraham came into frame: ?It's the wizard. What magic can he weave?? Often very little KB; it was not a great year for Abraham.<br>We all need a rest from the immaculate Bruce McAvaney, too.<br>He has been an enthusiastic and knowledgeable chief talking head but some of his specialities begin to grind the ears after six months.<br>Take for example the way he drools out the words ?special? and ?beyootiful? to describe good passages of play. And no one ever seems to slip or fall over. They ?go to ground?.<br>He has shared with every commentator - television, radio and print - the worst sin of all; the use of ?leg speed? when they simply mean pace.<br>Still, come next February-March, many of us will be dying to hear them all again, particularly after a summer of Lawry shouting, ?It's all happening?.<br></font></p>
