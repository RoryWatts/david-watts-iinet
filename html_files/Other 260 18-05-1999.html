            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Federal Government is likely to push ahead with Internet censorship legislation, despite Senator Brian Harradine's opposition to the goods and services tax.<br>Critics of the legislation have claimed that the proposed censorship was an attempt to win over Senator Harradine, a strong morals crusader who has been openly contemptuous of salacious Net content.<br>But a spokesman for Communications Minister Richard Alston yesterday dismissed talk of the legislation being sidelined.<br>The Bill, intended to set up a regime to block and filter X and R-rated content, would be debated in the Senate as soon as possible.<br>A Senate committee approved the legislation last week after the public had been given only nine days to make submissions.<br>More than 100 submissions claimed that the legislation would make Australian Net access slower and more expensive, would cripple e-commerce, fail to make a dent in offensive content and make Australia a laughing stock.<br>Leading opponents of the legislation say the Bill is a product of politicians' ignorance of the Net.<br>Critics speak out, Computers and<br>Communications, page 36<br></font></p>
