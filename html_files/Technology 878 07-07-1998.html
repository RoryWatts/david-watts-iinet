            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BE AFRAID, be very afraid. Just when you thought you were coming to grips with this still-new medium of the Internet, the goalposts are shifted ... again.<br>I speak here of those of us who have learnt some basic HTML (Hyper Text Makup Language); maybe got as far as tables or frames, and have made some simple Web pages. Or those who are about to embark on this quest which can help them join the millions of vanity publishers out there.<br>CNN reported with relish last week that HTML was all but dead. It is shuffling off to join Mosaic browsers, blinking headlines, rainbow gifs and the surprising number of objects the Web has managed to make irrelevant or redundant in its short life. Soon we will have to learn XML (Extensible Markup Language) to keep abreast of the trendies.<br>Before I try to explain what XML is, it might be educational to look at the state of the average Internet user. There are 1.5 million of us in Australia. On average we are likely to be professional males aged between 25 and 35.<br>But statistics are cold things. It is what is in the average Net user's head that is really interesting. Given that most grew up when computers still required a warehouse to house 300Mb, many still have certain phobias about the brave new world.<br>I, for one, believe little green men run around inside controlling everything. The technical term for this is hardware-challenged.<br>Others might find the following, passed on by a discussion group correspondent, more accurate portrayals of their state of computer-literacy.<br>If you are a man, then computers can be just like your better half:<br>1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.<br>2. The language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br>3. The message ?Bad command or file name? is about as informative as, ?If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell you.?<br>4. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br>5. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your money on accessories for it.<br>On the other hand, women might associate certain bloke characteristics with their PCs:<br>1. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br>2. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br>3. As soon as you commit to one you realise that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have obtained a better model.<br>4. To get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br>5. Big power surges knock them out for the rest of the night.<br>As for XML ... I am not going to tell you much because that would be far too nerdy in the context of this column. Suffice it to say that XML will require far more disciplined writing than HTML, particularly in regard to syntax and strictness in observing upper-case, lower-case regimes.<br>The resultant Web pages promise to be far more flexible and informative, overcoming the vagaries that different systems and different browsers produce.<br>?Watts Online columns, still written in basic HTML, are on the Web at:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/htmhelp.html<br>Help Desk<br>CNN's XML report:<br>www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/01/xml.idg/index.html<br>What the XML:<br>www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/5957/xml.html<br>West guide to HTML:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/htmhelp.html<br></font></p>
