            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE day scientists will discover that lettuce is fattening and little green sprouts cause cancer. This will save blokes from having to make polite conversation over dinky little triangle sandwiches made by their better halves.<br>In a girl-free, lettuce-free environment, we chaps make our sandwiches with big chunks of bread on which we heap slabs of ham or beef or lamb with lashings of pickles, tomato sauce or chutney.<br>My mouth is watering because soon I will be devouring bloke sandwiches every other week. This is when my mate Bill and I go to Subiaco Oval to watch the Eagles.<br>He makes a backpack-full of them. My role is to eat them. It is a beautifully balanced partnership.<br>Beside the bloke sandwiches, the other attraction of going to Subi to watch football is that games are free of television commentary. Like nearly everybody else, Bill and I do our own voice-overs. It leads to many witty remarks.?You're a mug number 47.?<br>?If you keep doing that you'll go blind.?<br>Occasionally we move off the umpires to the players. And every now and then we give the opposition a serve.<br>The downside is that every other week, when the Eagles are away, we have to put up with the TV boys.<br>Admittedly commentating can be a big ask. You try to talk under water with a mouthful of gravel about nothing but footy for two hours and . . . Hang on, a lot of us do that anyway. No wonder bagging the men in the box has become a national past-time. In summer it is Richie Benaud and company at the cricket, and in winter Bruce McAvaney's crew cop the slings and arrows of the ?you boofhead? variety.<br>In my bailiwick, the Internet, anticipation of the football season - referred to as the battle for the millennium by the hyperbolic Channel 7 marketers - has brought out a rash of discussions about commentators.<br>The Net might be the latest in electronic communication, allowing people thousands of kilometres apart to talk instantly to each other about anything, but that does not necessarily mean anything rational results.<br>Take the TV commentator subject for example. The group cannot even agree on what day it is. Perhaps this is not surprising given that an argument that begins in Perth at 10pm on St Patrick's Day can be entered into at 1.01am in Melbourne on March 18, while in Adelaide it is still 1961.<br>And like any other group of more than half a dozen Australians involved in a frank and meaningful, everyone in the Net mob is yelling at each other (you do this by typing in capital letters), and some have huffed off in a sulk.<br>Yes, it is democracy at work. Let that be a lesson to all those who seek peace and harmony by other means.<br>The one thing the TV commentary discussion group can agree on is that Dennis Cometti is far ahead of the pack.<br>Its only criticism of the velvet-voiced one - if it can be called a criticism - is that he probably spends the off-season practising his beautiful one-liners.<br>But, to paraphrase the man himself, like a cork in a bottle, Cometti keeps bobbing along.<br>The rest? Well they are all boofheads and drongos, and as someone we are about to hear a lot of might say: ?Gee, they're not special or clever.?<br>But now there are bloke sandwiches and umpires on toast to look forward to. Only six more sleeps to go until the season starts.<br>The big problem now is that I'm so excited I can't sleep. Does this mean a) the season will not start until I get six sleeps, or b) I should get out more?<br></font></p>
