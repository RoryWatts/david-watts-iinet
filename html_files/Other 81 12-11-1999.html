            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THAT'S IT, I've had it. I've wanted a republic ever since the principal threatened me with dire deeds when I was tardy in standing for God Save the Queen back in Year 11. That's nearly 30 years of patient waiting.<br>The first real chance to throw off the yoke of Britannia comes along and what happens? The majority of you want time to build a better republic than the one that was offered. You want to be democratic about things. You want a say in how we should be run.<br>It might sound like commonsense to you but I can't wait. That's why I've decided, unilaterally, to establish my own republic, right here in my own house.<br>Mind you it is going to start off pretty small. Other members of this household are not joining me in panicking about not being a republic. They're frightfully calm and logical and think a better one will now emerge. The dog's no use either. He's a cavalier king charles spaniel and therefore an avowed monarchist.<br>So my republic takes in my home office, basically. That's an area 2m wide, 1m deep and 1.79m high. It might be small, but it's powerful. The air around it is pregnant with possibilities. Matter of fact I better open the republican windows right now because the monarchist dog just let forth his appreciation of dinner into the air that is so pregnant with possibilities.<br>The first thing I intend to do as president of my own republic probably sounds a little traditional for such a radical organisation. I've long admired the modern trend to devote whole years to particular people. The Year of the Child, International Women's Year, that sort of thing. We are now celebrating a year for seniors.<br>What I want - and in my republic presidents get what they want - is an international year of the 40-something bloke. We've never had such a year before, so it's time (copyright: E.G. Whitlam) we did.<br>Planning is well advanced, according to the presidential palace (aka my little office). To start off the year of the 40-something bloke, there will be a mass gathering at Subiaco Oval. The republic will arrange for the Eagles and the Dockers to provide the entertainment.<br>At half-time the choice is between strippers and sheep-dog trials. Initially, the republic was going to pander to popular choice and go with the strippers only. But the inclination now is to have both on at the same time so that the sheep dogs get a decent workout at detecting the right whistles. This will put an edge on the competition.<br>After the gathering there will be mass barbecues, and a ring of fire - and possibly some blue flames - will be clearly visible from Floreat to Northbridge. Owing to the amount of drinking planned, this ring of fire could get out of hand and engulf areas from Floreat to Northbridge.<br>But never fear, the following week's celebrations will move away from the fire zone to the WACA for a one-day cricket match between Australia and someone we can beat easily; probably England.<br>The 40-something bloke spectators will be encouraged to give full voice to the philosophies of ?the older I am, the better I was?, and ?the game was better in my day?.<br>There will be oodles of culture too. The republic would like to book out several cinema complexes and have constant repeats of Showgirls, or any movies without plots, lots of action and desirable women taking their clothes off.<br>All catering for the year of the 40-something bloke will be done by their wives, girlfriends and significant others. So will all child-minding and social organising, and most of the talking on the phone that is required.<br>What's that you say? The international year of the 40-something bloke is always on?<br>Told you that we presidents always get our way.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
