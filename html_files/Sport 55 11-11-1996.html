            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE calm before the storm of Australia-West Indies Tests allows time to reflect on last Tuesday's Melbourne Cup, the biggest day in Australian sport.<br>In particular, we will look at how the rest of the world viewed the race that stops Australia.<br>But first, a little look at the local coverage. Channel Ten did a good job. Overhead shots from a bright yellow airship were a highlight, particularly when they showed tight finishes.<br>Channel Nine's friendly Eddie McGuire appeared to be the recipient of a dud script on Tuesday night's Nightline when he promised the cup would be shown in full after the break.<br>Instead, viewers saw the start, then there was a cut to the horses heading into the back straight.<br>Most curious of all was SBS World Sports which began a comprehensive cup night coverage with fashions on the field.<br>Overseas, it was predictably a different picture.<br>Americans had a lot more on their minds. They were busy electing a President as we Aussies were either collecting our Saintly-given winnings or crying in our beer.<br>CNN gave the cup a routine report, acknowledging its importance. US newspapers mostly ignored it, concentrating racing coverage on the sale of $10 million champion Cigar to an Irish syndicate.<br>ESPN's thoroughbred notebook mentioned that the cup was on TV at 11 major racecourses in the US. A big cup party was also being held in Denver, Colorado, with more than 100 guests expected to wear anything ?from high fashion hats to rugby shorts?.<br>In England, both The Times and Daily Telegraph concentrated on the dismal showings of favourite Oscar Schindler and Court Of Honour. Both papers had good words to say about Grey Shot's seventh.<br>The Telegraph reported: ?VRC officials were left wondering what carrot could be dangled to ensure the continued European presence on a glamorous race day that this year drew a crowd of 90,149.?<br>The Straits Times in Singapore made a big play of the Malaysian-Singaporean ownership of Saintly.<br>In Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post paid tribute to winning jockey Darren Beadman's ability to come back from the suspension served in the territory.<br>The Irish Times conducted a mini autopsy on the failure of Oscar Schindler in a report that ranked below a preview of the Ireland-Iceland soccer match.<br>Across the Tasman, the Christchurch Press paid homage to Bart Cummings feat in training his 10th cup winner.<br>The Wallabies stayed unbeaten on their European tour by beating Scotland 29-19 late on Saturday, but only night owls would have seen it in Perth.<br>Channel Seven telecast what it claimed was live and exclusive coverage at 12.55am yesterday after the oft-repeated Robin Williams movie Good Morning Vietnam.<br>If you lived in Sydney or Melbourne the match was on at 1.40am yesterday ... but that's their time. It means it was actually on at an almost decent hour, 10.40pm Saturday, in WA.<br></font></p>
