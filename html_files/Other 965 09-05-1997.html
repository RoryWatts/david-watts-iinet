            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE ALL know Sunday is Mother's Day. And who would dare deny it is a special day. However, and this is partly in response to colleague Pam Casellas' column of praise to wives and mothers on Wednesday, there are a few points to be made for dads as well.<br>Pam wrote about a woman friend of hers requiring a wife. That way the washing would be done, the ironing, the cooking and the 1001 other chores we non-mums take for granted.<br>But dads play a big part, too. After Pam's friend's story, and perverting it a touch, why not imagine a bloke needing a husband to provide all those things non-dads take for granted.<br>For a start there would always be tickets to the footy, no mad rush or queuing to make sure you could be at the big game.<br>The fridge would always have a goodly quotient of beer.<br>The television would be in good nick and the remote control would be easily located.<br>The car would be washed and fuelled, ready for the wife to take the kiddies all those places where they have to go ... cross-country folk-dancing lessons and the like.<br>The power tools would be neatly laid out and ready for use in the shed should the need arise for any simple handyman chores.<br>Dead mice could be dispatched from their traps with a minimum of fuss, face-making and screaming.<br>We could become serious and talk about discipline, respect and the much-needed alternative to constant mothering. But we won't. In fact let us now return to Mother's Day.<br>Did you know that 46 countries have a Mother's Day of some sort? It is not the same day universally. Australia shares the second Sunday in May with, among others, the United States, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey and Belgium.<br>M OTHER'S Day celebrations can be traced to the spring celebrations of ancient Greece in honour of Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. During the 17th century the English began celebrating Mothering Sunday on the fourth Sunday of Lent. It was a day when they acknowledged that poor overworked servants - who provided all the mother's chores to the rich - needed a day with their own mums. So the working classes were encouraged to go home for a pot of gruel or whatever, but had to be back in time to ensure the master and mistress had clean clothes for fox hunting.<br>Mothering Sunday became a religious ritual, still celebrated, honouring the mother Church. Special, fairly unappetising cake is given to parishioners in Anglican churches on Mothering Sunday.<br>Back to the present Mother's Day. Ana Jarvis, from Philadelphia, began a campaign to establish a national Mother's Day in 1907. She persuaded her church to celebrate it on the anniversary of her mother's death. Within a year the whole State of Philadelphia celebrated.<br>Ms Jarvis went broke a few times, but she and her supporters wrote endlessly to ministers of religion, politicians and businessmen so that by 1911 Mother's Day was a firmly entrenched celebration in the US. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, acknowledging what we all know - a determined mother will not be denied - declared Mother's Day a national holiday.<br>Since then, card sellers, chocolate makers and florists have had it pretty good come May.<br>And the second Sunday of the month allows us ample time to reflect on the wisdoms mothers have handed out over the years, including these:<br>??Don't sit so close to the TV or you'll hurt your eyes.? ?Keep your arms inside the car or they'll get cut off.? ?Your face will stay that way when the wind changes.?<br>? (To dad) ?Do you know what YOUR son/daughter did today??<br>? ?Put on clean underwear, you never know if you'll be in an accident.? And the clincher, for which there is no comeback: ?Because I'm the mother, that's why.?<br></font></p>
