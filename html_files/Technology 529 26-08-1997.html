            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Continuing last week's feature on search engines and directories, this week DAVID WATTS looks at some alternatives to the big guns and also checks out some sites that allow you to do multiple-searches.<br>Not only is there a lot to search for on the Internet, there is also a lot to search with. The most direct way of searching is with a major engine like Alta Vista, HotBot or Lycos, or with the most powerful directory, Yahoo. Several clever sites allow you to harness these big searchers together.<br>SearchScript developed by Perth student Bassam Aoun allows users to select all or any combination of Alta Vista, Yahoo, Excite and Lycos. Key in what you are looking for and SearchScript goes to each engine and opens a new browser window to show the results of the search.<br>The windows are spawned by the Java program at the heart of SearchScript and displaying them in tiles on screen often allows users to compare results quickly.<br>At the University of Kansas, a computer research team has developed ProFusion which works along similar lines but has some nice enhancements.<br>ProFusion uses other search engines - typically Alta Vista, Excite, HotBot, InfoSeek, Lycos, Magellan, OpenText, WebCrawler and Yahoo - to get initial search results. It then does more processing on its own to deliver the most relevant results, eliminating duplicate matches returned by different engines.<br>ProFusion also allows users to search with the fastest three engines, the best three or all. The university team chooses which are the fastest or best based on the history of results returned.<br>Users can also opt to select any combination manually. The big drawback with ProFusion for household users on 28.8K connections or slower is the snail-like response of the URL. Problems also arise when one of the engines cannot be contacted during a multiple search - forcing the entire search to stop dead.<br>The same problems do not arise with SearchScript. It is a local URL - at Curtin University - and responds much faster. And Mr Aoun has ensured that if one engine fails, the ones that are working still display their results.<br>A different approach to multi-searching is offered at the powerful Search.com, one of the many outposts of the cnet Web empire. The main engine here is Infoseek, but Search.com has a big variety of sub-headings, which when clicked, offer the best searcher for a particular interest.<br>Fields covered include cars, lifestyle issues, computing, business, employment and health.<br>Click on health, for example, and you are presented with some of these smaller specialty search engines: NIDR AIDS Patents, Dr Greene's HouseCalls, Environmental Organisation WebDirectory, Healthfinder.gov, HealthGate Free Medline and Reuters Medical News.<br>Similar arrays of options are available for the other fields. Search.com also uses Express Search which allows the user to key in a term, then select an engine from a drop-down menu. Choices include Yahoo, Alta Vista, HotBot and WebCrawler - all just about ubiquitous presences on the Web.<br>On a much smaller scale is WebGlimpse, a search engine developed in Arizona for individuals to use on their sites.<br>WebGlimpse attaches a small search box to the bottom of every HTML page and allows the search to cover just the neighbourhood of that page or the whole site.<br>It is possible for the search to cover remote pages linked to an individual's pages because WebGlimpse can collect these remote pages to the user's hard drive and index them - just like one of the big engines.<br>Its creators say it is easy to download, install and maintain. It supports searches for new documents only (example, those created at the site in the last three days), allows for misspellings, Boolean queries and regular expressions.<br>It is said to require less than 10 per cent of available hard disk space.<br>On the directory front, nothing beats Yahoo for global searches. But in Australia the Aussie.com.au Aussie Index has a host of information.<br>The index claims 1.6 million Australian businesses as well as personal sites broken into easily searched sub-directories under headings including arts and entertainment, shopping, computers, education, government and news and information.<br>Well worth a look is the Matilda search engine at the Australian branch of the World Announce Archive. The archive houses dozens of directories, including Good Causes where you can find Greenpeace and others.<br>HELP DESK<br>Bassam Aoun's work<br>www.ece.curtin.edu.au/ ~saounb/<br>SearchScript<br>www.ece.curtin.edu.au/ ~saounb/search/<br>ProFusion<br>www.designlab.ukans.edu/profusion/<br>Search.com<br>www.search.com<br>WebGlimpse<br>donkey.CS.Arizona.EDU/webglimpse/<br>Aussie.com.au<br>www.aussie.com.au/<br>Matilda<br>www.aaa.com.au/<br></font></p>
