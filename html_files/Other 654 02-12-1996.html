            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A COLLEAGUE told me the other day he believed all journalists were either dags or larrikins. Probably so; and maybe you can categorise the rest of the community the same way.<br>But first we have to know what a dag is and what constitutes a larrikin.<br>Dictionaries of Australian slang, or Strine, have no difficulty with the word larrikin. To wit:<br>larrikin n, v: Larrikin is Australian slang for someone who's fooling around, messing about, or engaging in mischief. The term derives from the verb ?to lark,? which since the Middle Ages has meant - not surprisingly - to fool around, mess about, or engage in mischief.<br>In simpler times, lads and lasses would spend early mornings trying to catch larks, considered tasty to pre-KFC palates. Many, however, spent their time doing anything but bona-fide ?larking?, and, as a result, the verb took on a cast of impish misconduct. If one says ?larking? with a thick Australian accent, it comes out something like ?larrikin?.<br>So that is crystal clear. Dag, however, having a lot to do with the unsavoury end of sheep, in particular, is not so easily or readily defined.<br>A visitors' guide to the Gold Coast, intended for foreign tourists, defines a dag as someone out of fashion. Daggy, it says, means untidy.<br>Dag is not a pejorative term. It is often applied with affection, unlike those very descriptive Aussie terms drongo, duffer, dingo, dobber, dud or derro.<br>I have constructed a small questionnaire designed to sort out the dags and larrikins among us. Please try to answer honestly.<br>1. You are at an outdoor mass at a Catholic school and in your picnic basket are cold cans of beer and tasty nibblies. It is six hours since you ate lunch. What do you do?<br>a. This is an outrageous question that I will not lower myself to answering.<br>b. Put my head down and try not to think about it.<br>c. Waddya reckon!<br>2. For women: A man you fancy bends over right in front of you to tie his laces. You:<br>a. Ignore it and look the other way.<br>b. Have a good long look.<br>c. Goose him and when he looks up with startled eyes, tell him: ?That's a far better bum than Michael Douglas's in Basic Instinct.?<br>3. For men: A woman you fancy comes to say goodbye after a party. You:<br>a. Shake hands.<br>b. Allow a chaste kiss on the cheek.<br>c. Grab her, hold her hard against you, kiss her passionately and say: ?There's more where that came from darling.?<br>4. At the movies for refreshment you:<br>a. Buy nothing and remain quiet.<br>b. Choose something soft and quiet like a chocolate bomb.<br>c. Buy Jaffas and eat them with noisy glee, occasionally rolling a few in dull moments.<br>If you answered (c) to all these you are probably a larrikin ... or a liar.<br>If you answered (b) to all you are a dag and probably honest.<br>If you chose (a) you are possibly lying.<br>If you had a mixed response then you are not used to these heavily weighted questionnaires and should try again.<br>???<br>OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES: A GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) of my acquaintance told me of acute embarrassment she suffered at a morning tea for other GYMs of her son's Year 1 class.<br>She was handing out pikelets or sandwiches or fairy cakes and noticed a lot of smirking and giggling. So she went to the class teacher and asked if she knew what was going on.<br>The teacher stifled her own guffaws to say that a few days before, the GYM's son was giving the news, and told the class: ?My mum doesn't wear any clothes to bed.? He got no further.<br>But one of his mates told his mum, who told her friend and so on.<br></font></p>
