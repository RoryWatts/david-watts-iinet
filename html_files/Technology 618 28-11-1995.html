            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF THE Internet was a house, chances are that dirty dishes would pile up in the sink and unwashed laundry would litter the floors.<br>The Net lacks a woman's touch.<br>Troglodytes say that a woman's place is in the home. Even if that were so, it would not be a house connected to the Net in its spare hours.<br>Two recent surveys and general observation of names in newsgroups, owners of home pages and lists from ISPs of clients online show a disparate domination of men.<br>A check of users logged on to iiNet, a major Perth ISP, last Wednesday afternoon revealed that of 72 users only 20 per cent were women. That is their user names were undoubtedly female. Only single user names were taken into account so it is not possible to say how many females were on the Net at the schools and businesses logged on.<br>A list of clients' home pages provided at http://www.omen.com.au/userpage.html by the Omen ISP was 100 per cent male. There was not one female user's home page of the 28 listed. Jasons, Shanes and Davids dominated.<br>A survey of US Internet use done in October by computer book publishers O'Reilly & Associates says the male-female ratio was 67-33.<br>But a survey which asked for Net users to answer questions online, by the Graphic, Visualization and Usability Centre of the US, found 15.5 per cent were female, 82 per cent male and 2.5 per cent responded: ?Rather not say.?<br>O'Reilly surveyed more than 29,000 people by calling them on the phone ... a technique it grandly calls Random Digital Dialling. GVU received responses from more than 13,000 people worldwide to questions it put on the World Wide Web.<br>The reason why apparently so few women use the Internet, or if they do, why they use it in a low-key way compared with men, may be found in an account by British writer Angela Phillips, a self-confessed ?Net virgin?.<br>She was one of 14 chosen by London's Guardian newspaper to use its offices, sample the Net, and write about the experience of their first time.<br>In her words: ?The world of computing is dominated by men with a mission to explain, but a total lack of communication skills. They are the men who live at the opposite end of the communication chain to the average woman.<br>?The trouble is that they have created the Internet in their own image. You have to get through hours of waffle before discovering a pearl, and by then you are too bored to notice.<br>?Dealing with the Internet is rather like being given a do-it-yourself car kit and a set of instructions which tells you how to vary the trim in 47 different ways, then how to set the headlights so that they can double as search lights. But it never tells you the simplest way to put your car together for immediate use.<br>?If you do manage to get on to the road you will find that there is no map. You are told to go out and explore the highways. As far as the enthusiast is concerned, the joy is in riding the open road. The fact that you actually wanted to get to the supermarket is not important.?<br>The nub of her analysis appears to answer age-old questions about the difference between men and women.<br>?Internet nerds go on about the wonders of disembodied communication in virtual space with people who can pretend to be whatever colour or gender or orientation they wish to be,? she said.<br>?Personally, I am hung up on the real thing. If I touch someone I want to feel real skin. If I talk to a friend I want to hear her voice so that I can tell whether she's at the end of her tether or just wanting a chat.<br>?If I interview someone I want to know, from his body language, whether he is telling the truth or whether there is something far more important that is stuck inside. On the Internet, the only clues to a person's feelings are the ones he or she types in. How do you cry in virtual space??<br>URL for The Guardian-Connect page: http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian/connect/<br>magazine.html<br></font></p>
