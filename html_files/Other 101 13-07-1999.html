            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE outgoing director-general of the BBC, John Birt, last week sounded some strong warnings about the effects of the exploding world of new media.<br>Sir John sees the globalisation of the media - through pay-TV, digital TV and the Internet - as a threat to British culture.<br>?We have already seen in this century the emergence of a global culture which is essentially American - the baseball cap, jeans, trainers and Pepsi are all ubiquitous,? he said.<br>His warning translates easily to Australia. We in WA are pretty familiar with the sight of young people, their baseball caps on backwards, rushing into McDonald's for a burger and fries.<br>Computer users take for granted that they have a trash bin on their desktops or that software registration programs will assume they live in the US and have windows to enter a zip code.<br>Internet users will have seen the extraordinary array of Web sites that regard the 4th of July, Thanksgiving and the Superbowl as events important to the whole world.<br>The Net is simply a big extension of what we are already aware ... the coca-colonisation of the planet.<br>This sells American culture short by boiling down its influence to consumerism and goods such as Coke and Levis. It ignores the best of American literature, music, the arts and so forth to concentrate on the negatives of ?dumbing down?.<br>But dumbing down certainly is something to guard against on the Net.<br>NUA Surveys predicts that next year 132 million Americans will be connected to the medium. That is nearly six times as many as the next wired country, Germany with 23 million. And it is many times more than the Net population predicted for Australia, which at eight million seems wildly optimistic.<br>With that sort of population dominance as well as the undoubted lead in developing Net technologies, it is no surprise that Americans will continue their dominance of the medium.<br>LAST week's report on the inefficiency of search engines - an American one of course - estimated that there were 800 million Web pages. A good conservative guess would put 600 million of them as American.<br>The Australian Where Did We Go survey site revealed that seven of the 10 sites most visited by Australians last week were American with Yahoo, Hotmail and Geocities well ahead of our own Whitepages and the Commonwealth Bank's Comsec.<br>Is this American dominance a bad thing? Is it just an extension of what we have come to accept in the last quarter of this century? Our most watched television, most popular film, and certainly the fashion senses of our young are heavily influenced by Americanisation.<br>But do we need to take a heavy-handed stand to filter or weaken these influences?<br>Wired News reported last Thursday that countries in the Middle East were taking such a stand to protect their cultures from the American influence on the Net.<br>But the result had been a stifling of Net growth through oppressive regulation, the Human Rights Watch organisation was quoted as saying.<br>The chosen methods to protect traditional culture were said to be strict censorship, high taxes and bans on some foreign Web sites. Clearly it would be wiser to adapt the consumer motto of ?buyer beware? and make it ?user beware?.<br></font></p>
