            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NO ONE seriously believes the England cricket team has a hope of regaining the Ashes from Australia.<br>Mark Taylor's super-confident team begins its campaign next week on the playing fields of England. But different cricketing campaigns are already being waged on the World Wide Web.<br>Possibly the most delirious is an English site called How England will regain the Ashes.<br>The recipe is very tongue-in-cheek and includes putting former England captain and known trencherman Mike Gatting in charge of catering.<br>The site is rumour-ridden - did you know Shane Warne is returning to Australia after the first three Tests are safely sewn up? - but lots of fun and even has links to a few serious sporting pages.<br>On the serious side of a serious game is the worthy Baggy Green site's Australia v England pages.<br>This vast database has the result of every Test between the two countries since 1877 as well as the statistical delights of highest wicket takers and greatest run makers.<br>Sir Len Hutton's 364 remains the highest Ashes score, but a man named Bradman is responsible for nearly half the next 14 highest scores.<br>Sir Don is a prolific figure on the Web. There is even a homage site in Canada. But the highest praise can be found at Australian sites, the CricInfo mirror and the State Library of South Australia's Don Bradman collection.<br>More modern cricket heroes can be found easily. The Steve Waugh is God page pays tribute to our number one batsman.<br>URLs<br>How England will win - www.bogo.co.uk/starter/ashes.html<br>Graeme Hick - users.ox.ac.uk/-mert0053/hick.html<br>Baggy Green - www.interprop.com.au/cgi-win/country.exe/2-1-0<br>Mark Waugh - bora.dacom.co.kr/-rebecca/<br>Rick Eyre's cricket page - www.ozemail.com.au/-reyre/cricket.html<br>Steve Waugh is God - home.sprynet.com/sprynet/herme/<br>The Aussie page - www.ozemail.com.au/-reyre/cricket/aussie.html<br>The Bradman pages (at Cricinfo) - www.cricket.org:8004/link-to-database/PLAYERS/AUS/B/BRADMAN-DG-0   Shane Warne page - www.well-com.net.au/-dpalmer/warne/<br>Sir Donald Bradman collection - dino.slsa.sa.gov.au/sslnew/bradman/index.htm<br></font></p>
