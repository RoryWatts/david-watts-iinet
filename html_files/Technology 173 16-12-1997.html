            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GET INFO<br>AFL 98; Win95 CD-ROM;EA Sports; Rated G;Price: $89.95; Score: 95<br>It is just as easy to be badly bruised playing AFL 98 on your PC as it would be if you were in a real game confronted by John Worsfold. The computer bruising is to the ego. You can be soundly thrashed without even looking like scoring a behind or taking a mark.This bumper game from EA Sports - maker of Cricket 97 - is so real it needs hours of training to even think about fronting up for a match. Not that many users will have the patience. AFL 98 is mouth-watering from the moment you install it. That is if you have the PC power, of course. It's a bit of a grunt-meister, requiring 16Mb of RAM, a Pentium and 25Mb of hard disk space at least.<br>If you do have the power, then AFL 98 will command a lot of attention. From the moment it plays a hyperactive video introduction of footy highlights - one is of Eagle Peter Matera in full flight and there are many shirtfronts and speccies - to the moment you start altering the playing abilities of some of the more than 350 players, it is a football lover's delight.The basic premise is to play a match, of course. As with everything in AFL 98, you have a lot of choices. You can play exhibition games, pre-season, premiership or finals.<br>The choice of teams is up to you. The choice of who you control is yours. The choice of interchange players too - you're the boss. And you even get to choose whether you want to hear Bruce McAvaney's reasonably realistic commentary.<br>There are also several different camera angles, choice of weather conditions, length of quarters (in the early stages, even two minutes can be enough time for a whipping) and configuration of keyboard controls (the mouse and joysticks are also viable, in fact up to four can play).There is so much organisation you may feel a trifle fatigued by match time. Don't. Matches require intense concentration. You have four buttons - whether keyboard or joystick - which control when a player kicks, bounces, accelerates or handballs.If you haven't got the ball those buttons determine defensive moves like tackling and charging down kicks. The aim is to clear the ball as fast as you can to team-mates within scoring distance. You have about as much vision as a real footballer and the opposition - controlled by the computer or another player - can move in very quickly.<br>It's all as exhausting and rewarding as the real thing. The upsides are the realistic approaches to the way the graphic characters move, the fact that real clubs and real players are used and have been realistically rated in terms of speed, strength etc (although you can change that) and the action that moves like a proper footy game.<br>The downsides are that it is very hard to learn - some ardent footy and game fans have reported seven hours before feeling confident - and that it requires a lot of PC power.<br></font></p>
