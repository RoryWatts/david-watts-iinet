            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET censorship legislation will severely curtail online discussions of political and social issues, according to a leading free-speech campaigner.<br>Irene Graham, an executive member of Electronic Frontiers Australia, claims the Online Services Bill is a smokescreen that hides its real agenda behind the stated objective of cleaning up Net porn and making the medium safer for children.<br>Ms Graham says the legislation, expected to be passed by the House of Representatives this week, is not about porn.<br>?This legislation is about blocking the free flow of adult discourse on social and political issues,? she said in a posting to the aus.censorship newsgroup, which has attracted more than 50 responses since it appeared a week ago.<br>?Almost filtered out by the hysteria over porn on the Net is the fact that R-classified material will be illegal to host in Australia, unless hidden behind a locked gate.<br>?Publication and access will be subject to the use of an adult verification system (restricted access system) yet to be identified and approved in writing by the Australian Broadcasting Authority.<br>?While some commentators seem to believe that films are classified R primarily because of sexually explicit or highly violent content, this is not true.?<br>Ms Graham said adult themes included verbal references to and depictions associated with issues such as suicide, crime, corruption, marital problems, emotional trauma, drug and alcohol dependency, death and serious illness, racism and religious issues.<br>In 1997-98, 68 per cent of films and 71 per cent of videos were classified R for reasons other than sex, violence or coarse language.<br>?Regardless of any noble aspirations or otherwise of the numerous critics of this legislation, it is about a great deal more than porn,? Ms Graham said.<br>?Those who say that opponents are solely concerned with the freedom of adults to access sexually explicit material do all Australians a severe disservice in trivialising the matter.?<br>Ms Graham, who runs an extensive site dealing with censorship matters, has created new pages dealing with the smokescreen issue, entitled Blinded by Smoke: The Hidden Agenda of the Online Services Bill 1999.<br>She quotes a 1996 statement against the failed American Communications and Decency Act. In the statement, Howard Rheingold says: ?Democracy is what's at stake. It doesn't have anything to do with protecting children from pornography, because there are better ways to do that. It's about the power to determine what people are allowed to say, write and believe.?<br>? Como ISP Mark Reynolds has stepped up his 1984 Project by sending every Member of the House of Representatives a copy of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four. His anti-censorship protest began last month with the sending of the novel to all 76 senators.<br>HELPDESK<br>Irene Graham's pages:<br>rene.efa.org.au/liberty/blinded.html<br>Project 1984:<br>www.rts.com.au/1984/<br></font></p>
