            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE WILL start with a joke because the bulk of this week's column touches on a very grave issue indeed, and a little levity might help you grapple with the seriousness of it all.<br>First, the joke. It was told to me by colleague Rod Moran and I pass it on without comment . . . except to say that Rod is possibly certifiable.<br>A ham sandwich goes into a pub.<br>Sandwich: ?Can I have a beer please.?<br>Barman: ?Sorry, we don't serve food here.?<br>Now for the serious bit: The scene is a Perth courtroom some time in the future, probably in about 15 years. The plaintiff is a nervous, twitchy young man of about 24. He has a baseball cap on sideways, an ear-ring and a tattoo (See? those fashions lasted).<br>I am in the dock, handcuffed. Let's listen to what Her Worship Judge Skye is saying.<br>Judge: And young man you say you have suffered dreadful trauma, have been unable to sleep most nights and are unable to hold down work as a computer programmer because you constantly look over your shoulder?<br>Plaintiff: I am m'um, I am indeed.<br>Judge: And you say the words said to you late that November night in 1997 are the cause?<br>Plaintiff: I do, but I hardly want to think about it.<br>Judge: Let me relate. At 11.30pm you and five other boys, all then aged nine, were sleeping over at the prisoner's house on the occasion of his son's birthday. Is that right?<br>Plaintiff: Yes m'um, but I'll go mad if you repeat the words.<br>Judge: I'm afraid but I have to. The prisoner came into the room and growled: ?If youse guys aren't asleep in five seconds, I'll kill yez.?<br>Plaintiff: Yes, oh yes (collapses in tears).<br>Judge: Prisoner Watts, you have been found guilty of causing the most heinous mental trauma. I sentence you to be taken from this place to a place of execution, and there that you be hanged by the neck until you are dead (See? Richard Court got his way too).<br>WITH the benefit of foresight, let's return to the here and now where I can plead some mitigating circumstances.<br>My wife and I took 15 children, aged between seven and 12, but mostly nine, to Timezone. There they went mad for an hour, riding pretend motorbikes and jet-skis and shooting aliens.<br>We then split them into three groups for the ride to our house. The noise in the taxi I took with five of them was so loud I had to communicate with the driver by tapping on the window. One other driver could not speak, and the third reported cheerily that she had worn earmuffs.<br>The 15 then demolished pizzas and ice-cream cake before adjourning to the backyard to play soccer (it was the night of Australia vs Iran after all).Unfortunately, as the house has just been renovated, there is no backyard to speak of, just this little replica of the Gobi Desert.<br>The result was that you could not see the kids for the dust they churned up. And this occurred right at the time parents arrived to take their immaculately dressed offspring home.<br>A few more noisy hours passed in front of Nintendo and video. Six boys were sleeping over. This is code for staying awake and giggling.<br>About 10.30pm, my wife started trying to soothe them with little claps of the hands and shoosh-shoosh noises.She did this every five minutes until 11.30, when she turned to me and pleaded: ?Darling (we were still talking at the time), I think this needs a male voice.?<br>And despite giggling along to their funny stories about farts and willies, I let fly with the growl.<br>It worked. We didn't hear from them until 5am.<br>I have to go to sleep now. Bye.<br></font></p>
