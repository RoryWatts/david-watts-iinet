            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT if they held an election and nobody came? Well, nearly nobody.<br>One of the best election sites on the Internet is Netcetera's interactive poll which allows users to vote by e-mail in their own House of Representatives electorate, in their own State for the Senate or in a two-horse race between Prime Minister Paul Keating and Opposition Leader John Howard.<br>The trouble is this new site had attracted only 335 votes for all House of Representatives seats by yesterday afternoon.<br>Only 223 people had made a choice between Mr Keating and Mr Howard - it is likely they were among the 335 Reps voters - and 69 had voted for Senate candidates.<br>A pity really because it is an excellent site with pictures and profiles of all Labor and Opposition candidates, maps of all seats and the vital demographic statistics of every Reps seat.<br>Although the actual voting figures are meaningless at the moment because of the small numbers, they do have Labor ahead of the coalition 160 to 99. Mr Keating leads Mr Howard 118 to 105 after trailing for the first four days of the poll.<br>Vote numbers in individual seats are ridiculously small. In Curtin, for example, the combined vote of independent Allan Rocher and Natural Law candidate George Kailis is five, tying with both Liberal hopeful Ken Court and Labor's Steve Roebuck.<br>Mr Howard has collected three votes in Bennelong and Mr Keating four in Blaxland.<br>With figures like these it is hard to say what the famous ?litmus seat? is.<br>Netcetera Multimedia has set up the site with Om.Com Internet service providers primarily to inform Net users about candidates in individual electorates and presumably to back off from the all pervasive Keating v Howard mentality.<br>Other features of the site are a news column and a feedback forum where views are aired.<br>Address:<br>http://www.netcetera.net.au/elections/two/display.html<br>The first opinion poll on the Net - run by Internet Protocol - had attracted 388 responses by yesterday afternoon and the coalition led Labor 142-132.<br>The coalition has led the poll for most of its three weeks, although Labor rallied strongly at the weekend, leading by a handful of votes until Monday.<br>The Democrats and the Greens were tied at 38-all.<br></font></p>
