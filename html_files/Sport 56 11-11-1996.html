            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Australian rugby union team is half way through a tour of Europe regarded as vital in rebuilding the Wallabies' position as one of the feared sides in the game.<br>The Wallabies, once international easybeats, became a rugby power in the 80s and 90s, first with the grand-slam unbeaten 1984 tourists to Britain and Ireland, then by winning the 1991 World Cup at Twickenham.<br>Since schoolboy William Webb Ellis first picked up the ball and ran with it during a soccer game at Rugby school in England in 1823, the game has grown to become the second most played football code in the world. More than 60 countries will try to be among the 20 finalists at the World Cup in Wales in 1999.<br>Australia has done it tough for much of its own rugby history which began officially with the formation of the game's first governing body here in 1874 - interestingly before one had been formed in Wales, one of the legendary homes of the code.<br>After the acrimonious split which saw rugby league created in 1895, union played third fiddle to the new code and Australian Football.<br>It has had a small nursery with Queensland and NSW providing the bulk of players; competes against heavily televised and promoted codes and against countries like New Zealand, South Africa and Wales where the game is a religion.<br>Yet with professionalism officially sanctioned last year and the emergence of the three-nation Super 12 series, rugby union is enjoying big crowds and publicity.<br>This tour, under affable new skipper John Eales, could unearth worthy successors to recently retired top players like Phil Kearnes and Michael Lynagh.<br>Australian Test Records<br>Most Consecutive Tests:            Phil Kearns 46 (1989-95).<br>Most Capped Player:            David Campese 101* (1982-96).<br>Fullback:                          Roger Gould 25 (1980-87).<br>Wing:                          David Campese 84.<br>Centre:                           Andrew Slack 39 (1978-87).<br>Fly-half:                Michael Lynagh 64 [72]** (1984-94).<br>Scrum-half:            Nick Farr-Jones 62 [63]*** (1984-93).<br>No.8:                       Tim Gavin 42 [44]**** (1988-95).<br>Flanker:                        Simon Poidevin 59 (1980-91).<br>Lock:    Steve Cutler 40 (1982-89), Rod McCall 40 (1989-95).<br>Prop:                            Ewen McKenzie 45 (1990-95).<br>Hooker:                            Phil Kearns 49 (1989-95).<br>*Campese has played 16 Tests at fullback.<br>**Lynagh played seven times at centre and once at fullback as a replacement.<br>*** Farr-Jones was capped once as a replacement wing.<br>****Gavin won two caps as a replacement lock] .<br>Michael Lynagh's world record: 911 points at an average of more than 12 a game.<br>Captains:<br>Nick Farr Jones 36 times between 1988-93; Andrew Slack 19 (1984-87); John Thornett 16 (1962-67); Greg Davis 16 (1969-72); Michael Lynagh 15 (1987-95); Tony Shaw 15 (1977-81).

The winner is awarded the Web Ellis Trophy (named after the legendary creator of the sp at Rugby school). The next cup will be in Wales in 1999.<br>Previous cups: 1987, won by NEW ZEALAND in New Zealand and Australia; 1991, won by AUSTRALIA in the four UK countries and France; 1995, won by SOUTH AFRICA in South Africa.<br>In the first three World Cups, 16 countries took part but in 1999 the field is being expanded to 20. In 1987 16 countries were simply issued invitations. In 1991 and 1995 the top eight finishers from the previous World Cup were invited (along with South Africa as hosts in 1995) and elimination rounds were held for the other eight places. For the 1999 cup, only the top three finishers from 1995 (South Africa, New Zealand and France) plus the hosts (Wales) will automatically qualify. The elimination process will involve teams from 63 countries playing a total of 138 games.<br>World Cup Records:<br>Most points scored by a team:<br>145 - New Zealand v Japan, 1995.<br>89 - Scotland v Ivory Coast, 1995.<br>74 - New Zealand v Fiji, 1987.<br>Most points by a player:<br>45 - Simon Culhane, New Zealand v Japan, 1995.<br>44 - Gavin Hastings, Scotland v Ivory Coast, 1995.<br>31 - Gavin Hastings, Scotland v Tonga, 1995.<br>Most tries by team:<br>21 - New Zealand v Japan, 1995.<br>13 - Scotland v Ivory Coast, 1995.<br>13 - France v Zimbabwe, 1987.<br>Most tries by one player:<br>Five Nations:<br>THE Five Nations tournament that pits England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France against each other is the premiere rugby event in the northern hemisphere.<br>The last 10 winners:<br>1986: Scotland<br>1987: France<br>1988: Wales<br>1989: France and Ireland<br>1990: Scotland<br>1991: England<br>1992: England<br>1993: France and Wales<br>1994: Wales and Scotland<br>1995: England<br>The NZ Haka:<br>THE New Zealand All Blacks perform the Haka war dance each time they play.<br>The words are chanted loudly in a menacing fashion accompanied by arm actions and foot stamping. A haka was traditionally performed before charging into battle.<br>The words are based on the 140-year-old story of a warlike chief Te Rauparaha of the Ngati Toa tribe. He was chased by enemies and hid in a pit waiting in the dark for his pursuers. He heard sounds above and thought he was done for when the top of the pit was opened and sunshine flooded in. He was blinded, but when his vision cleared he saw the hairy legs of the local chief who had hidden him.<br>Te Rauparaha is said to have jumped from the pit and performed this haka on the spot.<br>Words<br>Ka mate, Ka mate<br>Ka ora, Ka ora<br>Ka mate, Ka mate<br>Ka ora, Ka ora<br>Tenei Te Tangata Puhuruhuru<br>Nana i tiki mai whakawhiti te ra<br>Upane, Upane<br>Upane Kaupane<br>Whiti te ra<br>Translation<br>It is death, It is death<br>It is life, It is life<br>It is death, It is death<br>It is life, It is life<br>This is the hairy man<br>Who caused the sun to shine again for me<br>Up the ladder, Up the ladder<br>Up to the top<br>The sun shines!<br>RUGBY League was born in 1895 when players in the north of England demanded to be paid for playing as a compensation for loss of earnings while doing so. From then League was professional and Union amateur; a distinction that became steadily more blurred with under-the-table payments and endorsements in many Union strongholds.<br>Union became truly professional in 1995.<br>League has lured many good Union players over the years with lucrative offers. Some have made the transition well. Australians like Dick Thornett, Mike Cleary, Phil Hawthorne and England's Martin "Chariots' Offiah have represented their countries in both codes.<br>Main differences:<br>Union has 15 players; League 13<br>Union points: 5 for try, 3 for penalty or field goal, 2 for conversion.<br>League: 4 for try, 2 for penalty goal or conversion, 1 for field goal.<br>When tackled: Union play continues as mauls or rucks of opposing players try to win possession.<br>League stops and the tackled man plays the ball to a teammate. If it is the fifth successive tackle the ball is turned over to the opponents.<br>Out of bounds: In Union, opposing forwards line up against each other and try to win possession when the ball is thrown in.<br>In League, opposing forwards lock together in a scrum to try to take possession by raking the ball out.<br>David Campese:<br>CAMPESE has come to be the icon of Australian rugby during the 1980s and 90s.<br>The strong, unorthodox winger, famed for his "goose-step' acceleration played his 100th Test when he donned the gold and green against Italy in Padova last month.<br>Campese was born on October 21, 1962, in Queanbeyan, NSW, just outside Canberra to Gianantonio and Joan Campese.<br>He played rugby league from the ages of 8 to 16 and was also a good golfer.<br>He first played rugby union for Queanbeyan Whites as a fourth grader in 1979 and won first grade selection the following year. "Campo' is the world's leading try scorer and Australia's most capped player with 100 Test appearances since his debut against New Zealand in 1982.<br>He shares with Greg Cornelsen the Australian record for the most tries scored in a Test, crossing the line four times against the US Eagles in 1983.<br>In the 1991 World Cup he earned the title of Player of the Tournament after scoring six tries in as many games. Against South Africa in 1992 he scored his 50th try.<br>During his career he has spent many off-seasons playing in Italy for the Milan Club.<br>The Campese record:<br>Height: 180cm<br>Weight: 85kg<br>Occupation: Business Owner<br>Honours: ACT, Australian U21, NSW, Barbarians, Australian Sevens, Australia<br>Test debut: 1982 v New Zealand<br>Points: 315* (64 tries, 8 conversions, 7 penalties, 2 dropped goals).<br>Tours: 1982 New Zealand. 1983 France and Italy. 1984 Fiji; UK and Ireland. 1986 New Zealand. 1987 World Cup. 1988 England, Scotland and Italy. 1989 New Zealand; Canada and France. 1990 New Zealand. 1991 New Zealand, World Cup (UK). 1992 South Africa; Ireland and Wales. 1993 World Cup Sevens (UK); New Zealand; North America and France. 1995 World Cup (South Africa). 1996 Italy, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.<br>* Points do not include present tour.<br>Sources of statistics and information:<br>http://www.xtra.co.nz/rugby/index.shtml (NZ Rugby home); http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~benc/sites/all.html (Rugby URLs); http://www.rugby.com.au/ (Official ARU site); http://rugby.phys.uidaho.edu/rugby.html (RugbyInfo page); http://www.campo.com.nf/ (Campo's World).<br></font></p>
