            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE rugby union World Cup on Saturday night was not a great game, but it was a great result.<br>That goes for Australians and Channel 7, which is licking its lips at the prospect of good ratings for the Davis Cup final, also against France, next month.<br>Perth people, not noted rugby fans, watched the game in big numbers. Program director Jamie Martinovich said the late-night audience peaked at 167,000 or 66.9 per cent of all viewers.<br>But now that the scenes from Cardiff are fading and the strains of the Marseillaise and Advance Australia Fair are ghostly echoes, it's time to reflect on how the cup proved that life is not a simple game.<br>Let's start at the end. The Queen looked as if she would rather have been taking tea with John Howard and Kerry Jones.<br>She had just witnessed about 90 minutes of brute force and occasional brilliance dominated by the famous Wallaby yellow brick wall, which only one American breached in five weeks of rugby.<br>Her Majesty had to confront all these murderous brutes with her customary smile and present them with medallions.<br>First, she handed them to the French, representatives of a nation famous for taking the axe to crowned heads.<br>Then she handed the cup and medals to the Wallabies, who, according to injured hooker Phil Kearns, had all voted for a republic in the referendum.<br>The Sunday Telegraph in London painted all this as an anti-climax when compared with the last cup in South Africa.<br>It noted that Nelson Mandela presented Francois Pienaar with the cup while wearing a Springbok shirt. ?We were unlikely to see the Queen parading around Cardiff in the yellow No.5 shirt of John Eales, the Wallaby captain, but it might have lent a little more to the occasion,? the paper commented.<br>Despite the overwhelming republicanism of the combatants, perhaps it was a small relief to the Windsors that the winning coach's name was Macqueen. Seven's coverage allowed we Australian couch potatoes to wallow in that great Welsh tradition, music.<br>You can't ask for more than Shirley Bassey and Bryn Terfel in fine voice. But we were rewarded - if that is the right word - with Rolf Harris and some French pop stars singing what I think was called Booga, Booga, as well.<br>And whose side were the New Zealanders on after that shock hiding at French hands that put a long white shroud over the North and South Islands?<br>Would they cheer on their traditional enemies, we of the underarm bowling, or go for a nation responsible for setting off nuclear tests in their backyard?<br>I couldn't get a straight answer from New Zealanders in Perth. One, who'd always been happy to talk about Jonah Lomu, told me to go forth and multiply, while another wrote a page and a half assassination of the All Blacks style without answering the question. And another question remains unanswered: just how do you pronounce Joost van der Westhuizen?<br></font></p>
