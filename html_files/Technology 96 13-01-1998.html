            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Microsoft finally looks like delivering on the promise of Win95 with a solid upgrade which shows much improvement.<br>Windows 98 is like the shark off Cottesloe. It is out there, just waiting to kill. Several thousand people around the world have been testing Microsoft's new operating shell for up to more than six months. Their views are fairly easy to find on the Web. And, overall, 98 is getting the thumbs up. After more than a fortnight's test-driving, Access can join the chorus of approval enthusiastically.<br>What is most remarkable about 98 is just how unremarkable it appears at first glance. People who have installed Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 may wonder what the fuss is all about.<br>It seems a deliberate ploy that Microsoft developed and released MSIE 4.0 last October. It has given many people the chance to get the feel of a PC devoted to an Internet view of everything. The Web view is at the heart of 98 too ? as an interface. Users can configure their PCs quickly so that programs are activated with one click, the mouse pointer changes to a hand, folders can be viewed as Web pages and the browser can be used as the main tool for looking at everything.<br>So MSIE 4.0 users can do that already on their Win95 systems. What 98 will give them is a lot more reliability, performance and stability. Even though Access has been testing a private beta version - unofficial sources predict a public beta in a month or so - it is almost rock solid. In two weeks there have been no crashes. Any problems that have happened have been noted by 98 itself and in nearly all cases fixed while the PC barely missed a beat.<br>There are a few minor bugs, such as the shutdown screen going on strike occasionally but, basically, 98 has been such a good performer it is going to be a tear-jerker on January 31 when the program expires.The unofficial word is that Microsoft will release 98 in June. Windows 3.x users, as well as those on 95, will be able to upgrade. This will be the last OS capable of supporting 16-bit programs. New Windows systems after 98 will be 32-bit (and better) only.<br>With an estimated 80 per cent of computers in the world driven by Windows, Microsoft has a lot at stake with 98, which is why one senses it has slowed down to get it right.<br>Rather than the revolution of 95 which came to the market amid huge hype - and then great criticism - 98 is already looking like the product it meant to release 212 years ago. One of the reasons 95 ran into early snags was the optimistic promise that it could run on low-end 486s with 4Mb of RAM. The outcry by people who believed that is a possible reason hardware has gone through such an explosive growth in the years since 95's release. On the right hardware, 95 is very good. Similarly, 98 is better. Do not expect a happy time without at least a Pentium 133 and 16Mb of RAM. And just to be sure, make that 32Mb.<br>Microsoft lists the following as 98's significant features:Easier installation: The upgrade wizard walks you through the installation and lets you know how much time is left.Scheduled system tests: You can schedule 98 to check your configuration and hard disk regularly. The tune-up wizard tries to ensure peak performance.System updates: Internet connection on demand when you need to find new drivers, for example.Better diagnostics: The standard diagnostic tool, Dr. Watson, has been upgraded to cover a wider range of problems.Windows 98 will also support several new hardware standards. These include:n USB (Universal Serial Bus): Enables you to add peripherals easily to your PC. This is done using a small, rectangular-shaped connector that's easy to insert. MS says it is fully plug'n'play and USB devices can be connected and disconnected with the PC still running. Examples include mice, joysticks, keyboards and scanners.DVD: The high-capacity optical discs that look like CDs but hold much more data - from 5 to 17GB.3-D acceleration.MMX processors.<br>None of this is to say that 98 does not have its problems. Beta testers have said they have not been able even to boot up after installation. More common is a failure to read their CD-ROM drives after going to 98.<br>One tester, Blake Bowden, has a 98 Web site with a lot of information. It includes a wish-list, provided by himself and other users, of features they would like to see in 98.<br>These include an assistant such as the one in Office 97. ?That would be the bomb. Have a problem? Just click on the guy on the bottom left corner. That would really help out people who aren't familiar with the Windows 95 OS,? says Mr Bowden.<br>A crucial improvement suggested is the ability to convert a hard disk back to a Fat16 configuration. Windows 98 enables brave users to convert from Fat16 to Fat32. However, if programs will not work, tough luck. There is no way back without are-format.<br>The verdict: Windows 98 is so full of promise that June can't come soon enough.<br>HELPDESK<br>Microsoft overview: www.microsoft.com/windows98/<br>Blake Bowden's 98 page: www.connect.net/blake/IE4/index.htm<br>Memphis/98 page (many links): www.memphis97.com/ie4.index.html<br></font></p>
