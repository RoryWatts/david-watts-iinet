            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">E-MAIL is the second most used feature of the Internet after surfing the World Wide Web.<br>It allows rapid correspondence for personal and business matters, participation in newsgroups and the ability to join mailing lists of like-minded people.<br>It makes sense then to have as good an e-mail program as possible. WestWeb has spent the past fortnight testing Eudora Pro 3.0, the latest release of the Qualcomm program, and comparing it with Pegasus, Eudora Light and Netscape Mail.<br>The verdict is favourable. Eudora Pro's latest version is a delight to use in its speed, features and ease.<br>But so are the others. It boils down to personal preference and how professional you need your e-mailing capabilities to be.<br>First let's look at Eudora Pro 3.0, released in October and available in both 16 and 32-bit versions. Its maker, Qualcomm, claims more than 18 million people use Eudora mail clients.<br>Eudora Light is heavily used in Perth and does a good job at basic sending and receiving with a few add-ons like folder management and signatures.<br>The Pro version differs significantly in its power and has a lot to recommend it for heavy or business mail use, as opposed to purely personal Net mailing.<br>On the surface Pro looks like Light, but it has some great features.<br>There is a spell checker, the ability to compose mail in different fonts, sizes and colours - this is a little superficial as you need Pro at the other end to receive this enhanced mail as sent - easily configurable interface for quick folder management, mail filtering, 90 days of free telephone support, and a 150-page manual.<br>It also features support for multiple e-mail accounts, Unix-to-Unix encoding-decoding and multiple nicknames and signatures.<br>The filtering ability of Eudora Pro is a highlight. It is possible to tell the system to check contents of messages for certain words or phrases and have the mail directed to appropriate folders.<br>This gives the ability to trash messages you do not want to see.<br>The downside to Eudora Pro is that it costs more than $100 (recommended retail is $US89).<br>And for $US89 less - that is, free - you can have Pegasus Mail which does many of the same things. Pegasus, which claims 4 million users, has a spell-checker, filtering, multiple account support and signatures among others.<br>The main problem with Pegasus is that is a little confusing to configure, particularly for new users. It is not even readily apparent how to get an ?out? folder or copies of messages you have sent, or how to append a signature.<br>Pegasus also does not appear to check for mail in the background, a standard feature of both Eudoras.<br>However, as a free mailer it is impressive and a significant step up in features from the also free Eudora Light.<br>For pure convenience though, it is hard to go past Netscape Mail. There is no need to use anything but Netscape if all your Net time is spent browsing the Web, sending e-mail or reading news.<br>Netscape Mail is easy to get at in the browser, relatively easy to configure and has the biggest bonus of all - automatic decoding of graphic attachments.<br>The same goes for Web pages. HTML is automatically read as if you were using your browser and all add-ons, audio, animation and video work in the mail window.<br>Perth favours Eudora<br>EUDORA appears to be the most popular e-mail program in Perth, and the Light version is most favoured among a small group surveyed by WestWeb.<br>Of 20 people in the iiNet Fogies discussion group, 12 said they used Eudora Light while three used Eudora Pro. Three used Pegasus and two Netscape.<br>Most of the Light users had stuck with the program after being provided with it by iiNet when they signed on.<br>Several had tried other programs, including Netscape, Pegasus and MS Exchange, but found Eudora Light easy and convenient.<br>The three Pro version users were all involved in computing businesses. The Pegasus users said they preferred it because it was free and feature-rich.<br>URLs for e-mail programs:<br>Eudora: www.eudora.com<br>Pegasus: www.pegasus.usa.com<br>Download from your Internet Access Provider (check on availability), or tucows.ois.net.au/ (the Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software).<br>More e-mail programs, freeware and shareware, at cwsapps.tower.com.au/cwsa.html.<br></font></p>
