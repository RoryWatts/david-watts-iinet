            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Extreme Measures (M)<br>Hugh Grant, Gene Hackman<br>Directed by Michael Apted<br>? ? ?½<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>IN Four Weddings and a Funeral, Hugh Grant made audiences think what a nice, soppy English comic he was. When Grant was found in flagrante delicto with a Los Angeles prostitute in his car, he made people think what an idiot he was.<br>Now, in Extreme Measures, a medical mystery thriller co-produced by girlfriend Liz Hurley, Grant has the chance to make people think what a good dramatic actor he is.<br>Audiences will also have the chance to think about some moral questions well beyond the wisdom of paying a hooker for pleasure.<br>The bottom line is Grant is not bad at all in a dramatic role that, in typical Hollywood style, calls for him to associate with the lower orders, ward off gunshots in an underground tunnel and act like Arnie in physically overpowering a bigger, meaner opponent.<br>Extreme Measures, for all its attempts to portray ethical and moral issues and provoke thought, is another gritty, gun-ridden drama where action often overwhelms dialogue.<br>But it is well done in all the necessary departments - well acted, scripted, directed and photographed. A fairly accomplished piece of unsurprising predictability all round.<br>Grant plays brilliant young British doctor Guy Luthan who is on a visiting fellowship to a low-rent New York hospital. He is on the verge of joining a crack team of neurologists at New York University. The world is his oyster.<br>His easy, humorous charm and brilliance light up an otherwise very grotty emergency department at his hospital. It is the type of place where the blood flows, tempers fray and everyone yells at once - MASH, Hill Street Blues and ER combined. In short, it is the sort of place where you never want to end up.<br>A very agitated, unwell and naked homeless man lands on the table in front of Dr Luthan one night and in his only lucid moment pleads for help. He dies a mysterious death and the only clues are a mumbled name and phrase and a nameless hospital bracelet.<br>Dr Luthan wants to get to the bottom of this. But the body goes missing. The morgue superintendent will not help ... ?You're really quite a creepy person,? a frustrated Dr Luthan tells him.<br>The hospital boss Dr Manko (Paul Guilfoyle) won't help either.<br>But young Dr Luthan will not be dissuaded. His quest for answers hints more and more at a conspiracy of murder and torture.<br>Enter the smiling villain, one of the best at this sort of caper. Gene Hackman is Dr Lawrence Myrick, much-decorated neurological genius, whose work at trying to regrow damaged nerves seems above reproach.<br>Myrick is admired by a small army of wheelchair-bound victims, but, ominously, is guarded by gun-wielding henchman in his sterile, ultra-modern clinic.<br>It slowly dawns that Myrick is using human guinea pigs for his nerve-growing trials. They are not volunteers. They are the lowest of the low: homeless yet healthy men with no families and only friends in need.<br>The zeal of the ?good? Dr Luthan confronts the zeal of the ?bad? Dr Myrick in a showdown over ethics. The question is: do you take one human life to cure the misery of paralysis in thousands?<br>Grant and Hackman play this well, though Hackman is such a persuasive figure it is sometimes hard to tell hero from villain.<br>For his next act, Grant may want to try something really serious - like a British drama where resolution does not come so conveniently from the barrel of a gun.<br>In the meantime, well played sir.<br></font></p>
