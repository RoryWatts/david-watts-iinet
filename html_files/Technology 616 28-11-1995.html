            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LIRON LIGHTWOOD'S pay-TV FAQ sounds like a science fiction television series, which is appropriate considering the 27-year-old Melbourne computer programmer is a self-confessed TV addict.<br>It seems that like so many computer buffs he is also a Star Trek fan and the 11pm time-slot of his favourite show on free-to-air TV has driven him bonkers enough to write an authoritative guide to pay-TV in Australia.<br>Not only Star Trek but frustration with the Federal Government made him an advocate of pay-TV.<br>?The great fiascos which surrounded our Government's attempts to introduce pay-TV into this country helped spur my interest,? Mr Lightwood said.<br>?I am interested in pay-TV because I believe it will increase the choices for viewers.<br>?The reason why I put together this FAQ was to tell people in Australia about pay-TV, firstly because I could, and secondly because, unlike other people, I believe that pay-TV could do some really good things for Australian viewers.<br>?I went overseas last year and experienced the good and bad of cable TV. As a result of this and other things, I believe that pay-TV has brought a lot of good programs to viewers that they wouldn't have otherwise had a chance to watch.?<br></font></p>
