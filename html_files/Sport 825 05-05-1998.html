            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN A sporting first, the armchair this week moves to the second deck of the three-tier stand - right behind the goals - at Subiaco Oval.<br>Here The West Australian inserted a camera in the brain of a West Coast supporter for Sunday's match against St Kilda.<br>It is called brain-cam and here is what it revealed ... after being prised from the supporter's head amid a pool of beer and tears in a dark alley early yesterday morning:<br>First quarter - Gee it's hot. I hope the Saints suffer from this. I'm exhausted and in a sweat just from the climb to the seat.<br>It's a bit tight. We haven't got Kempy and where's that goer Braun? Still we should stitch them up by four goals. Surely, they can't do much in this heat without Burke, Loewe or Hall, can they?<br>And look, we're just playing it close; not getting much of a run, but not letting that Harvey cut loose.<br>Onya Drew.<br>Second quarter - What are they doing? Stop that big bloke with the dyed hair, what's-his-name, cut us up last year, yeah, Everitt, the dag on the Footy Show.<br>There he goes again. Ah! Lucky that one was a point.<br>What? Are you mad, umpire? A goal? You have to be joking. If it comes down to a six-point game, you're history.<br>And who's that Saint kicking them cleanly from 50 each time he gets a run? No. 6. Where's my Record? Must have dropped under the seat when I was booing the goal umpire.<br>Ah, a goal to Gehrig on the siren. Where has he been?<br>Third quarter - Donnelly, yes, Gehrig, welcome back, Bennee, brilliant. Oh, they're good. What did Mick do at the break? Must have put a cattle prod into Fraser. He's running now.<br>Jakovich, you're stupendous!<br>Another goal; oh, this is beautiful. This is special. Where is Bruce McAvaney when you need a few superlatives?<br>Got 'em now. They're running out of legs ... but is three goals enough of a buffer?<br>Last quarter - Way to go, boys. 27 points, yes, can't be that much time left either. They're gone. We're home!<br>Gee, this Harvey never gives up. That looked so easy. Hey, another one. Two kicks from the bounce and they're scoring. Wait a minute, what's happening?<br>Get in front of that big Spider, Ashley. Oh no, not another goal. What's the score (gulp)? Is it really just four points?<br>... Onya Lovell. Ten points, too hard now. Must be nearly over. But the bloke behind reckons old George on the radio says three minutes 47 seconds to go. No, surely they couldn't.<br>Come on Josh, stop that Jones. Gee he's fast. What a kick!<br>Four points again - must be less than a minute -don't like the ball down here.<br>Yes! Well done Ashley, that'll be a bounce...<br>What ... what's he done? ...<br>Here the tape is nearly indecipherable. One side of the brain-cam is saying ?beautiful game, worth seeing, hard to beat?; the other is scrambling something that sounds like ?moider the bom?.<br>But it's only a game ... right?<br></font></p>
