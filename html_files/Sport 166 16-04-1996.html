            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA INTERNET users are on top of the ladder in creating inventive football sites on the World Wide Web.<br>Outmarking all is Todd Culley of Curtin University whose homage to Geelong superstar Gary Ablett has the ability to stop surfers in their tracks.<br>We see Gary Ablett leaping to take the mark of the year against Collingwood in round seven, 1994.<br>A skilful overlay of pictures is repeated for as long as the surfer stays with the page, letting Ablett fly repeatedly. In the great Jack Dyer's words: ?He jumps so high he marks a seagull.?<br>As well as the animated ?speccy? there are details of Ablett's career, achievements, more pictures and Geelong results, regularly updated.<br>Chemical engineering graduate Andrew Dare has jumped into The West Australian's Topteam fervour.<br>At his impressive WAFL site, Mr Dare allows users to download a Topteam program which he wrote that will allow football enthusiasts to make team selections and chart their progress.<br>Topteam is written for Excel and is simple to follow, mapping all players named in The West Australian by position and ranking.<br>The WAFL site has been one of the best football sites in Australia and gives a wide array of information about WA's own league.<br>The West Coast Eagles team has its own official home page now and it will gradually ease out the W'Eagle Web started by supporters last year.<br>Eagles spokesman Peter Taliangis said last week the official page was launched a fortnight ago after weeks of testing.<br>West Coast Web has everything W'Eagle Web had and has added new features. In fact Karen McCulloch, who prepared W'Eagle Web, is the major creator of West Coast Web.<br>The Fremantle Dockers had an unofficial site all last year, but it has been dismantled. A handsome official site has now been established.<br>URLs: Gary Ablett:<br>http://student.curtin.edu.au/~eculley/<br>WAFL (with West Topteam software)<br>http://www.iinet.net.au/wafl/wafl.html<br>West Coast Web:<br>http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/<br>Fremantle Dockers:<br>http://www.dockers.com.au<br></font></p>
