            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Welcome to the Internet, Kerry Packer. The media mogul is joining software mogul Bill Gates to spread the words of his numerous television and magazine outlets on the World Wide Web.<br>You can bet Mr Packer's will not be some sleepy home page. Imagine this: ?Hello, I'm Kerry Packer, wealthy Australian, Here are some of my favourite links: Casinos of the world, cricket, polo, Loony Tunes (that's for my boy James and his girl Kate) and the Department of Communications. This page is under construction, soon I'll add links to Foxtel and Fairfax.?<br>No, Mr Packer's Web presence is bound to be a thumping, commercial one. His family's Publishing & Broadcasting Limited announced recently a partnership with Microsoft to form a Net service.<br>It is likely to be on a browser near you by spring. Microsoft expects the combination of the Microsoft Network (MSN) with contents from Women's Weekly, the Bulletin, Cleo and Channel 9 to attract 300,000 subscribers by the end of its second year, and be profitable after three.<br>Subscribers can expect to pay the same as MSN's 75,000 do now - $9 a month and $5 an hour to surf the MSN-9 sites, or channels as Microsoft likes to call them.<br>Mr Packer's PBL is a significant entry on the Web. The company obviously sees there is money to be made in cyberspace. The cross-promotional opportunities must also have been seductive.<br>Until now, Channel 9 has had little presence on the Net. A major exception has been regular criticisms in newsgroups of A Current Affair and 60 Minutes for a perceived anti-Net bias in their presentation of stories about porn and bomb recipes.<br>Perhaps Nine's current affairs shows will find the Net is actually far more than a place where sensational stories can be found once PBL stakes its claim there and tries to lure punters to part with their money to look at their goodies.<br>It could also come as a shock that many on the Web do not like to pay for information that is often freely available from a rich array of global sources such as CNN, the Washington Post and The Guardian, to name but a few.<br>Commercial TV, up to now, has kept a respectful distance from the Web. Several surveys of Net users suggest they prefer its interactivity to the passivity of TV.<br>Nine, as I said, hardly has a presence. Affiliate station QTQ in Brisbane has a home page made up mainly of information about its news team, and consisting of US links to Days of Our Lives, ER, Friends and the David Letterman Show.<br>TVW-7 in Perth has a similarly quiet page which does seek to offer interactivity by providing a feedback forum for Today Tonight and gives excellent information on Telethon, plus links to the AFL.<br>Australia-wide, the Seven Network has a feature-rich site with a shade too many plug-ins necessary for an easy browse. But it has some good links to its shows, and the one to a list of every AFL grand final played is a footy lover's delight.<br>Channel 10 also seeks to present a network view with links to program guides, publicity packs and information about some of its shows.<br>Pay-TV networks Foxtel and Optus Vision both offer livelier Web sites than any of the commercials, and the ABC took to the Web with gusto early on.<br>One thing seems certain: Mr Packer, accustomed to having things done his way, is about to poke his head up in a far more critical medium where the ?remote control? has an almost infinite range of choices.<br>HELPDESK<br>MSN: www.msn.com.au<br>TVW-7, Perth: www.iinet.net.au/tvw7<br>Seven Network: www.seven.com.au<br>Ten Network: www.ten.com.au<br>ABC: www.abc.net.au<br>Australia's Richest (Kerry Packer profile): www.2000.fairfax.com.au/articles/best_of/1kpacker.html<br></font></p>
