            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web can seem just too much trouble when it is busy. Sites either take ages to load or are inaccessible because of traffic jams.<br>When you have limited time online and want to visit a variety of places, this frustration can take the enjoyment out of surfing.<br>Offline surfing may sound like an oxymoron but it is very possible, just as much fun and faster.<br>A simple way to surf offline is to load Web pages to your hard disk through the File/Save As (or Control S) keys.<br>This is effective for one-off visits to pages, but does not load graphics, audio-video or external links from the downloaded page.<br>Enter the Web agent; software that can scan any site and download all its links and images to your hard disk quickly.<br>Agents, as the name implies, are middlemen on the Net; and like middlemen in the real world require a slice of the action. Their commission is a good 5Mb to 10Mb of your hard disk space.<br>If you can afford that, there are many good reasons to employ an agent to download a favourite site quickly for future viewing offline, giving you more time to explore new Web sites online.<br>With Windows95 it is possible to place an offline site on your desktop for a quick, double-click visit via a browser.<br>WestWeb has test driven three agents: Teleport Pro, NetAttache Light and WebWhacker.<br>All three can be employed while browsing the Web online. Then a site needed for downloading can be plugged in to the agent for retrieval.<br>Once that is done - and all three agents require slightly different methods of setting up a site - the agent plucks each link from a site and all images if required and downloads them to the hard disk.<br>The easiest example is probably Teleport Pro. Say you want to explore the entire Phantom site offline. Call it to your screen while online and activate Teleport Pro.<br>Open a new Teleport file and then open a Project (Teleport's method of organising dozens of pages and images).<br>Key in the URL of the site you want on your hard disk (in this case that is http://www.thephantom.com).<br>Check one of the four options for how far you want Teleport to follow the site (this is important because it governs how many files will be downloaded. Remember that the Web is exponential and one page can lead to 100 which may lead to 1000).<br>The options allow you to choose to stay on one page only, to follow the path, to stay in the domain of the site or to follow all external links.<br>Push the start arrow and Teleport will start connecting through your TCP/IP protocol. It will grab the pages and put them on your hard disk and just as importantly organise them in the same file structure they are in at their Net site.<br>To test your offline surfing, disconnect from your provider but keep your browser open. Use the Files/Open file menu and follow through the directory structure to Teleport's Projects folder.<br>Click on the filename you have called your Phantom project and it should appear on your screen in less than half the time it took to appear online.<br>NetAttache Light is free.<br>WebWhacker is the most impressive graphically, but makes the user place files in categories they may not like. All three can be downloaded through:<br>cwsapps.tower.com.au/agents.html<br>Many other agents are also reviewed.<br></font></p>
