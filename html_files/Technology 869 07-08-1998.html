            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU can do almost anything on the Internet, even send an e-mail to the White House to see if anyone knows how Monica Lewinsky is getting on.<br>Or you can send long letters and pictures of the dog to old friends overseas for the cost of a local phone call.<br>Or ask Microsoft boss Bill Gates for a lazy few million dollars.<br>You can do countless things . . . but you cannot kill Kenny.<br>For those who have not been formally introduced, Kenny's death takes centre stage each week in the cult television cartoon series South Park, shown on both SBS and Foxtel's Comedy Channel.<br>The incomprehensible Year-three boy meets strange, but never unexpected deaths in every episode, though he was spared in one show.<br>The other regular cussing and swearing little boys in South Park greet Kenny's death with a cry of: ?They killed Kenny, the b....s.?<br>But at South Park's official Internet site, run by Comedy Central, killing Kenny is considered murder, so to speak.<br>You can get the little guy, all bundled up in his weird orange snow clothes, bang in the red crosshairs of the sight of an imaginary gun. Pull the trigger and you are the dead one, however.<br>This frustrating scenario is presented at the South Park Shoot "Em Up game, one of a collection of skilfully animated and amusing pastimes for serious users of the World Wide Web of the Net.<br>South Park is not only a growing TV phenomenon, it is fast becoming a cult to match the X-Files and Star Trek on the Net.<br>The all-seeing Yahoo search facility which indexes millions of Web pages, lists nearly 200 sites containing the words South Park in the title in its television category.<br>The Ultimate TV List, a huge site listing popular shows of the past 30 years, has more than 35 South Park sites on the Web, eight places to find episode guides, four chat groups, two e-mail discussion lists and a newsgroup (an electronic bulletin board that allows firm, freewheeling e-mail arguments).<br>The Shoot "Em Up game, then, is just a small sample of what is available. One site called Barbrady's has pirated complete episodes and lets Net users watch them via video replay on their screens - a process that can take hours of downloading and chew up computer resources.<br>Live video on the Net looks like stopgap animation even at fast connections. But South Park looks like stopgap animation anyway, so the attraction remains.<br>Shoot "Em Up lets you pick off - in a totally virtual way of course - a goat, a bear, a couple of unfriendly South Park residents and the truly strange Scuzzlebutt, the mysterious, kindly creature with a stick of celery for a hand and Patrick Duffy for a leg. (yes non-South Park watchers, it is a very weird show).<br>But you cannot kill any of the four central characters of the show, Cartman, Kyle, Stan or the usually doomed Kenny.<br>All the characters pop up on screen at random intervals. The computer user controls telescopic sights on a gun with the mouse. Click the mouse and the gun shoots whichever character is in the sights. You get 10 points for killing one of the lesser characters, but lose ammunition if you hit one of the boys.<br>It is a variation on a common interactive Internet theme, seen before in games such as Slap a Spice Girl and Whack an Eagle.<br>If this all sounds too bizarre and tasteless, then consider that the TV show itself is arguably worse.<br>One Sydney journalist wrote recently that South Park was to cartoons what the Sex Pistols were to music. This puts The Simpsons on the same theoretical level as the Beatles.<br>The issue of copyright on the Net has been a tortured one with examples of corporations such as Disney closing down home users' pages with threats of big legal suits because they had copied images of well known characters.<br>But the whole South Park experience - pirated videos and all - seems to be going on without a care.<br>This global imitation really is proving flattering for the show whose reputation has spread by the most sophisticated word-of-mouth the world has seen.<br>nThe official South Park site with the Shoot "Em Up game is at:<br>www.comedycentral.com/southpark/<br></font></p>
