            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>The Rugrats Movie (G)<br>Directed by Igor Kovalyov and Norton Virgien<br>IT WAS a near thing but I nearly had to see the Rugrats Movie on my own. Even though I was convinced I was young enough to go by myself, it was a great relief when the kids decided to come too.<br>Not that you have to have children to enjoy this big-screen expansion of the popular television cartoon series shown on the ABC and on pay TV station Nickelodeon.<br>Rugrats is enjoyable without the little ones. But it is far more entertaining with them and their infectious laughter.<br>For those who have not seen the TV series, it has a cult following not only among the under 10s, but in student and older circles as well. It is popular like South Park, but able to be watched by grandparents without fear of embarrassment.<br>The movie version takes the normal 15 minutes of fun among a funny group of toddlers who wildly misunderstand the adult world, and tries to make it fill nearly 90 minutes.<br>Dennis Cometti might describe this as a shade ambitious. After all the TV show's strength is in its characters who inhabit a small world containing a few rooms and their backyards. The biggest adventure is to go to the park which is virtually another planet.<br>But the movie takes them deep into the woods which, as the nerdy Chuckie says is ?biggerer than the backyard and the park put together?.<br>These woods, full of wolves, storms and a troop of escaped circus monkeys, allow the Rugrats band to indulge in Indiana Jones-type adventure with a resultant increase in colour, graphics and quality of animation that will surprise those who are delighted enough already by the exploits in the confined spaces of the small screen.<br>However, it does take away from the TV show's clever characterisation and witty dialogue. It was disappointing that the naughty Angelica played a relatively minor part.<br>The catalyst for the move to the woods is the birth of Dylan Prescott Pickles (or Dil Pickles). He is the little brother of the bravest Rugrat, Tommy, but upsets the balance of the toddlers' world with his crying and selfish behaviour. His parents are not thrilled either.<br>Twin Rugrats, Phil and Lill, hatch a plan to take Dil back to the hospital or ?baby store? as they call it. Their mode of transport is a hulking, dinosaur-inspired trolley designed by Tommy's down-at-heel inventor dad.<br>Need it be said that the toddlers take a few wrong turns, inserting themselves in the back of a truck which crashes on a mountain road and spills them deep into the woods.<br>The missing children provoke a media frenzy which provides one of the film's funniest scenes - for adults.<br>A loathsome TV reporter, one of a pack of nasty characters who turn up at the Pickles house when the children disappear, asks Tommy's parents: ?Is it true a dingo ate your baby??<br>The kids, meanwhile, have to cope with a series of events that start with chaos, move through disaster, and end up in near-calamity. Luckily it is only a cartoon, or they would all be dead inside five minutes.<br>The adventures in the wood, plus the frantic search for the children, are woven with a sub-plot about loving your siblings and your friends which gets a bit too cutesy-pie at times. It is saved by lines like this from either Phil or Lill (it's hard to tell them apart) who tells Tommy: ?You used to have a bestest friend ever, but now all you got is a brother.?<br>Children are going to find this film hard to resist. Not one of the 20 in the cinema where I saw it had a bad word to say. Every funny bone had been well and truly tickled.<br>Parents will probably receive a warm glow, too.<br></font></p>
