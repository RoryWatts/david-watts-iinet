            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ENOUGH of whingeing. The past few Armchair columns have tended to accentuate the negative and eliminate the positive.<br>The acid has been on:<br>?Too much irrelevant one-day cricket.<br>?No perspective on the coming Ashes Tests.<br>?The almost total absence of Perth Glory coverage.<br>It is wrong to think those criticisms make sport on television worthless. Far from it. There is just as much that is good as bad.<br>At the weekend, the ABC again showed enough basketball to earn its hoops. Channel 7 chimed in with the worrying Perth Wildcats loss to Brisbane on Sunday. SBS paraded not only the Italian and English soccer, but also took us into the hyped-up world of American football.<br>And Channel 10 was high on petrol fumes again, this time from Bathurst.<br>For the traditionalists, Nine looked a villain with another Canberra Comets one-day cricket match, this time the surprise victor over Tasmania on Saturday.<br>But the local version of Nine has to be applauded loudly for covering first-class matches from the WACA Ground.<br>The weekend's offering of six hours of the WA-Victoria shield match was absorbing.<br>However, it was not just the fact that here was a close contest between teams with a big complement of heavies - Tom Moody, Damien Martyn, Adam Gilchrist, Justin Langer, Brendon Julian, Matthew Elliott, Paul Reiffel, Damien Fleming and Shane Warne to name a few.<br>Nor was it just another chance to check out the recovery of Warne's shoulder (not quite there yet).<br>What made it worthwhile - again - was the friendliness of it all.<br>There is something about Nine's local coverage that is totally devoid of the pretensions that the parent network adopts when it covers anything from the Tests to the most meaningless one-dayer.<br>Michael Thomson is no Richie Benaud, nor is Kim Hughes an Ian Chappell, or Bruce Yardley a Tony Greig.<br>And thank goodness. Instead of detached aloofness, loud shouts of excitement and heavy sales pitches throughout play, Thomo and crew are more likely to tell jokes, have a bit of a laugh and generally make viewers relax while they do.<br>They are no less knowledgeable than the ?big boys?, indeed Yardley should be allowed microphone contact with players on the field he is such an astute judge.<br>And they are just as capable as Greig and Chappell of being over-opinionated. But when they are, another of the commentary crew is just as quick to take the wind out of them with a joke or caustic aside.<br>Thomo's WACA team is one of the pleasing things about summer in Perth. It is not too loud, not too arrogant and usually signals the type of days where you can easily say: ?You wouldn't be dead for quids.?<br></font></p>
