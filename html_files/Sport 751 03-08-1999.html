            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FREMANTLE Dockers supporter Shane Richmond was at a loose end the day after his side beat St Kilda in a Saturday night match at Subiaco last month.<br>Then, inspired by the highlight of that game, he went to his computer, virtually unpacked his Shockwave expertise, and designed a game that can be played on the Web.<br>The highlight of Fremantle-St Kilda was umpire Peter Carey's skilful chest mark during play which earned him a little ticking off from the AFL, as well as an almost permanent place on the TV news.<br>Mr Richmond, 23, came up with the Peter Carey game to add to an already humorous collection on display at his personal Web site.<br>Using Photoshop and Paintshop for the graphics, and Macromedia Director for the action, he put together a game which allows users to control umpire Carey with their mouse.<br>Their task is to manoeuvre Carey into a position where he can mark the pass from Docker Adrian Fletcher to his teammate Brad Wira.<br>If you cannot make the umpire get in the way after five attempts, you have to start all over again.<br>Mr Richmond runs a small Web development business called Blackboy Interactive, but says the creation of games such as the Peter Carey one has nothing to do with work.<br>He says he does not use Shockwave for clients usually. But he does use it - and expertise gained in receiving a post graduate certificate in interactive multimedia from Edith Cowan University - to amuse himself and brighten up his Dockers site.<br>Other games created by Mr Richmond include Virtual Willsy and Whack an Eagle. Web users have to help Andrew Wills kick a goal after the siren in a mythical grand final in Virtual Willsy. And in Whack an Eagle, they have to keep West Coast spies away from a Fremantle training session.<br>Peter Carey game: users.wantree.<br>com. au/~richmond/carey.htm<br></font></p>
