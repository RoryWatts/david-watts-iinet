            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EXPLETIVE deleted the 60s. That goes for all the other so-called good old days, too.<br>Why must people persist with aimless nostalgia, pretending things will never be as they were, certainly never as good as they have been?<br>The most perverse recent example of this was the 25th anniversary of Woodstock, grossly corporatised for the 90s.<br>You would have thought the baby boomers (haven't all non- boomers had enough of them?) had dominated the thought waves enough without this gushing ?defining moment, seminal event? rubbish they used to talk about a pretty good pop festival, the stars of which are now dead in the ground, or just dead but no one will tell them.<br>If I were a teenager, I'd be 27 years younger. More important, I'd have had it up to the back teeth (if I had any) with older people coming along telling me things would never be as good as in the 60s.<br>Come to think of it, when I was a teenager in the 60s I was fed up to the back teeth (which I had) with older people telling me things would never be as good as during the war (that's WWII).<br>Practically every generation has to bear the cross of The Good Old Days.<br>The ancient Romans used to be told by even more ancient Romans that they didn't have circuses like the circuses in Augustus's day, no sir; Christians weren't made of the same stuff any more ... not that you could see from what the lions left behind.<br>And Vikings were probably nagged incessantly during their raids by hoary old horned helmet heads telling them to ?Rape, pillage THEN burn, you whippersnappers? (or the Old Norse equivalent ... vippaschnaepper?).<br>Face it, the 60s were full of rubbish. They had cigarette ads on every other billboard, newspaper, magazine and television way back then.<br>If you wanted anything better than fish and chips after 6pm on a Sunday, you had to hope your mum was a great cook.<br>Cars were cumbersome and dangerous.<br>Fashion was straight out laughable ... flares, platforms, floral puff-sleeved shirts, beads, medallions. As for the women ...<br>Schools were places of World War II discipline - salute the flag, march to class, sit up straight - in which today's under-achievers would have been lampooned mercilessly.<br>The peace generation became the me generation and garnered unto itself the right to make the most chokingly awful television shows like Thirtysomething in an attempt to say its generation was more thoughtful and creative than any other.<br>Why then, when this mob of 40-50 somethings are now in charge of the world, are things still groping along?<br>Shouldn't we have rocketed through the age of Aquarius and be cohabiting peacefully in communes, raising consciousness and too-good- to-be-true, feeling, caring kiddies?<br>No - we got nasty, scolding political correctness instead.<br>The day the baby boomers and the glamorisers of the 60s are taken out and hidden in a deep, dark valley along with their Melanie tapes will be the day everyone else can get on with living for the present and appreciating things for what they are - not what they should have been or might have been.<br>And why classify and segregate the generations anyway? It seems by putting labels on baby-boomers, x-generation, wrinklies and so on, you create plenty of room for bias and misunderstanding.<br>The Who spoke only to a small group when they sang of My Generation. But as their original listeners aged (it's worthy to note that Pete Townshend is now technically deaf and 50 and writes conservative letters to the editors from his mansion), younger people caught up with the music and the feelings. This means My Generation now stretches across two or three gens.<br>In essence we should all be One Generation - and be getting on with life instead of staring mawkishly backwards.<br>And that may also stop more and more of us buying 4WD vehicles to negotiate the wilds of Nedlands and Subiaco, thereby blocking ordinary drivers' view of 90 per cent of the traffic.<br>It could stop those stupid ads on television where families are all so happy and energetic around breakfast tables - fair crack of the Rice Bubbles, who ever saw such a thing?<br>Or anything else you don't like for that matter.<br>David Watts is a former night editor of The West Australian, now working on new technology developments.<br></font></p>
