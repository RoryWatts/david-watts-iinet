            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DEAR Internet, this is a belated happy 30th birthday greeting. Sorry about the delay but my modem had trouble connecting because of all the traffic caused by 200 million of us out there in cyberspace.<br>It is hard to credit that you are really that old. We who know you well realise the first 25 years of your life were fairly dull, colourless and boring - all that text on steam-driven computers connecting at 1200 baud.<br>It must have been fun to finally get some action with a decent browser like Mosaic that showed pictures as well as text.<br>I know that's long gone - five years seems an eternity - and its natural successor, Netscape, has lost the plot with its shopping button. But thanks to Bill Gates' Microsoft, the Explorer browser is becoming part of the furniture and it sure is decent of old Bill to make it such an integral part of Windows.<br>Thanks to you dear old Internet, I am now a very busy person, often labouring for long hours over what to the uninformed might seem useless or trivial matters.<br>Last Wednesday was a good example. I worked for four hours in the evening and one on Thursday morning just to send a seven-second audio file to a friend in an e-mail.<br>This friend is a Goons fan like me. For years we have regaled each other with the ?What time is it, Eccles?? routine.<br>You know the one where Bluebottle asks Eccles the time and he replies he has it written down on a piece of paper. It transpires that the time written on the paper is 8 o'clock.<br>Bluebottle rightly asks Eccles what he does if people ask him the time and it's not 8 o'clock.<br>Logically, Eccles replies that he doesn't show them the piece of paper.<br>Anyway recently I received a CD with an episode of the Mysterious Punch Up the Conker from which the Bluebottle-Eccles gem is taken.<br>I decided to surprise my friend by sending him a snippet. It turned out to be a very tiny one.<br>FIRST I recorded the 3min. 35sec. segment of the CD on to my hard drive with the RealPlayer Jukebox available on you, dear old Internet. This produced a 37Mb .wav file ... about 36.5Mb too much for a normal, weighty e-mail.<br>So I went to work with the Wave Editing Studio supplied with the Sound Blaster sound card. Four hours later I had a 1.2Mb .wav file which I zipped with WinZip into a 740Kb package. I e-mailed this to my friend. It took five minutes to leave my system and about four to enter his.<br>All for seven brutally edited seconds.<br>What wonders will you serve up next for me to occupy my time with dear old Internet?<br>I've already abused my download limit by playing radio stations over the Web. I've heard them gasp, cackle and stop completely as congestion takes its usual toll.<br>Mr Gates told a BBC interviewer recently that he sees your future on the TV screen or on a computer that is operated by speaking to it.<br>The computer will answer. And Mr Gates says we will be able to select its personality.<br>Dear Internet, I can hardly wait.<br></font></p>
