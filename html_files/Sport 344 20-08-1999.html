            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EXACTLY a year ago in this column, I wrote of my addiction to football. I can now say it is cured, thanks to Brisbane.<br>Four weeks ago I watched in horror as the Lions from the deep north dismembered my beloved Eagles. And last Sunday I started watching them do it all again - but with more feeling - to the F . . . word side, also known as the Shockers.<br>By half-time I'd had enough; turned off the carnage and rejoined the real world where I was surprised to find people who did not want to talk about leg speed and guts and determination.<br>By leaving the couch, I was also able to take badly-needed aerobic exercise by throwing my hands repeatedly up in the air in shock and dismay.<br>Thank you Brisbane. I now intend going to the theatre instead of staying at home to watch Tony Lockett pulverise the F . . . team tomorrow night. I may even garden or walk the dog rather than look at the evil things the beastie boys of the Bulldogs do to the Eagles on Sunday.<br>Strange thing isn't it. Since the beastie boys renounced the F . . . word of Footscray to become the Bulldogs, they have gone from strength to strength. The F . . . word was undoubtedly the yoke that held poor, old Fitzroy back for years, finally forcing it to merge with Brisbane. And look what has happened there.<br>Must be a lesson for the Dockers in all that. An F . . . word automatically turns the side into an F Troop.<br>As for the Eagles, I'm just waiting for them to be taken back to the medical clinic they were obviously dragged to six weeks ago, so they can have their real brains and hearts put back in.<br>It is a stupid game. Now I can think about far more important issues.<br>Just the other night, one such issue dawned on me while I was not thinking about football. It is: what constitutes a handsome man?<br>My wife and I were watching a Jackson Browne concert on pay-TV. Browne is a nice singer-songwriter, who at 51 still looks like a 28-year-old with clean, ungreyed hair and remarkable Californian teeth that would not be out of place in the Brady Bunch.<br>My wife immediately pronounced him handsome, right up there in her books with Patrick Rafter and Bruce Springsteen.<br>Blokes don't like to be drawn on these matters in case someone gets the wrong idea, so I simply said: ?He's all right I guess.?<br>We asked the teenage daughter of the house what she thought and she snorted: ?He's gross.?<br>Unlike a lot of teenage jargon, such as awesome, wicked and ugly, gross actually means what it says, so my daughter had declared Browne not handsome; certainly nowhere near her ideals of Prince William or that dorky bloke on Dawson's Creek who reminds me of what aliens are supposed to look like.<br>Is it a generation gap thing this handsomeness question? Is it like popular names published this week in U, out with the Berts and Teds and in with the Joshuas and Shanes?<br>Is it such an individual matter that there is no definite answer?<br>Or do handsome men really exist? According to New York columnist and author Jonathan Ames, borrowing from the Bible and Oscar Wilde: ?All men are intrinsically ugly. That's why God created woman, to compensate for the ugliness of man. He screwed up with the first sex and improved with the second.?<br>I tend to agree. Blokes squirm when confronted with handsomeness, but we are placid and easily manipulated if faced with Nicole Kidman or Elle. Better to go down the all-blokes-are-ugly line; it makes life less traumatic.<br>And ugly is a winner in football. Think of Mick Martyn or Tony Liberatore. Jackson Browne or Prince William would not stand a chance.<br>Ah, football, where men can be their ugly selves at last . . . oh dear, and I thought I was cured.<br></font></p>
