            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOME people might think there is a public debate raging about Net censorship in Australia.<br>However, it is neither very public nor a debate. The whole issue - important not only on civil rights grounds, but also on the future of electronic commerce - has descended to the level of sensationalist TV or radio talk-back shows.<br>Communications Minister Richard Alston made no bones about it last Wednesday when introducing the legislation that is designed to stop access to X-rated Net content, and to put up shields to stop under-18s accessing R-rated material.<br>Senator Alston admonished the Opposition, saying: ?Labor must now stop its stupid political posturing on this issue and confirm that it will support measures to stop paedophiles, drug pushers, bomb makers and racists from using the Internet to spread their poison.?<br>This is known in the trade as a motherhood statement. It has no great proof behind it, as more than two million Australians who regularly access the Net might attest, but it is virtually impossible to argue against.<br>Who in their right minds wants paedophiles, racists, bomb makers and drug-pushers pushing poison?<br>But anyone who now questions Net censorship either for its practicality - and most critics consider it unworkable - or its motives can expect to be tarred with the motherhood brush.<br>Not that many critics have much time to complain.<br>A Senate committee was last week given just nine days to examine the legislation which political commentators say the Howard Government wants to push through as quickly as possible.<br>Nine days is certainly little time to consider why the Net, which pushes hundreds of millions of views with mostly text and simple graphics - and yes, some of it is created by paedophiles, drug pushers and racists - should be judged by the same criteria as passive media such as television and films.<br>And in nine days will anyone choose to remember that Net censorship was examined in great depth by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in June 1996? Senator Alston agreed then with the ABA's recommendations that the Government had little to do with regulating the Net, and that the industry and adults should develop their own methods for shielding children from the nasties.<br>I wrote in The West Australian at the time: ?The ABA's call for parental supervision, self-censorship and an industry code of practice puts the regulatory ball at the feet of Australia's one million Net users. It is a move away from Government intervention and sends a message to politicians to tread cautiously in areas they know little about and which have the potential to change society for good.?<br>But, if you now listen to Senator Alston, who accepted the ABA report, the Net is now too full of paedophiles, drug pushers, bomb makers and racists to let the populace make responsible decisions.<br>Why the change? Why the rush?<br>You need only look at the fact that Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine's vote will be lost after June 30 and the Government will face a hostile Senate. It wants Senator Harradine's vote on the GST and Telstra before then.<br>And Senator Harradine believes the Net is too full of paedophiles, bomb makers, racists and drug pushers.<br>Help Desk<br>Censorship resources:<br>Liberty or Tyranny:<br>rene.efa.org.au/liberty/<br>WAIA resources:<br>www.waia.asn.au/Issues/<br>Regulation/DCITA/index.html<br>A guide for family use:<br>www2.onlineaustralia.net.au/<br>aba/index.html<br></font></p>
