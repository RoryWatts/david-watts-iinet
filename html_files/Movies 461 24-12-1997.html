            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FilmFlubber (G)<br>Robin Williams<br>Directed by Les Mayfield<br>H H<br>THE creative team at Disney appears to have been indulging in too many illegal substances. That is the only way to explain the existence of the Robin Williams film, Flubber.<br>Why remake the pleasant but unremarkable 1961 movie The Absent Minded Professor? Why put the zany slapstick of Williams through too many meaningless and mostly empty scenes?<br>The explanation might also be because they can do neat things with computer graphics and animatronics . . . so there.<br>What Flubber does most is use special effects to try to blind the audience to the fact there is not much beneath its frenetic surface.<br>Flubber is the story of Professor Phillip Brainard, an egghead so absent-minded he forgets his wedding day to college boss Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden) three times.<br>On the third occasion he blows up his basement lab while inventing an oozing green, frictionless, very energetic compound called flubber (for flying rubber).<br>The penny drops right from this moment that Flubber is going to be a bit too ootsy-cutesy for all but the youngest or most easily amused. Why?<br>Well the green flubber acts like a poor lost little animal. It makes purring noises and responds to stroking and gentle words.<br>And it assumes the shape of a human-like character.<br>Already we have been introduced to Brainard's helpful sidekick Weebo, a flying robot that has the conversation and intellect of a human and which plays lightning fast video replays from old movies to help convey its messages (example: feeling sleepy - a shot of one of the Seven Dwarfs yawning).<br>So Brainard invents flubber and this, we know, will be the compound that saves his college from financial ruin and his fiancee from the arms of his no-good, cheating rival Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald).<br>Why Brainard doesn't save the college with Weebo the flying robot - an amazing invention - is hard to comprehend. But anyway, he also has to battle the college's scheming benefactor Bennett Hoenicker (Wil Wheaton) and two very dumb henchmen who try to steal the invention.<br>In the process Brainard has to prove Flubber's worth by applying it to the shoes and hands of the college's ridiculously unfit basketball team and to the engine of his Ford Thunderbird.<br>Both the team and the car fly. No one notices the car even though it often flies at traffic-light level. And only the bad guys care much that basketballers are leaping not only five metres high, but 10 metres in length to come from 50 points down and win.<br>Robin Williams is badly wasted in this. His talent for mimickry, self-mockery and pathos is often wrongly used in films (for example, the forgettable Jack).<br>The makers of Flubber seem to have bet on Williams' funny faces, one-liners and likeable character as enough to guarantee a winner.<br>It doesn't work. You can't make a flimsy film based on one star - the rest just go through the movements - and on special effects.<br>The flubber might be energetic but it's just filling in time.<br></font></p>
