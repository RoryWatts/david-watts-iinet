            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DANGER is their business. The men who drive Formula One racing cars in world championship Grand Prix races are almost legendary in their devil-may-care approach to sport and life.<br>The word dashing comes to mind at the mention of Juan Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Stirling Moss, Graham Hill (and his son Damon) and Ayrton Senna.<br>Formula One drivers race at speeds above 200kmh in million-dollar cars which can look as fragile as eggshells.<br>If motor sport was music, then drag racing might be raw rock, rally driving country and western and Formula One opera. It is the ultimate.<br>Grands Prix have been raced around the world since the 1920s. Then, as now, they were an opportunity not only for daredevils to test driving skills, but also of car makers to push their craft to the limit.<br>The world championship came into being in 1950 under the, at first, loose control of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) -- a body representing the motor sport bodies of the world. The Confederation of Australian Motor Sports (CAMS) is the Australian body and ran GPs at the present Albert Park site, at Lakeside, Longford, Sandown and other courses.<br>Originally, Grands Prix were independent events, financed and organised within their host countries. The FIA merely set the technical regulations for F1, and designated certain Grands Prix to be the qualifying rounds for the drivers' and constructors' championships.<br>But in the 1970s the idea of non-championship Grands Prix died out as it became more and more expensive to hold F1 events.<br>Now the world championship is tightly run over a set agenda of races and under a set of technical and procedural regulations and specifications known as Formula One.<br>The FIA and the constructors' body, FOCA, set the rules under the Concorde Agreement.<br>The FIA president is responsible for setting rules and policy for F1, but he's limited by the Concorde Agreement in how quickly and how far he can push things his way.<br>The FOCA president still controls the purse strings for Grand Prix racing.<br>Jack Brabham<br>AUSTRALIA has produced two Formula One world champions. Jack Brabham won in 1959, 60 and 66; and Alan Jones in 1980.<br>Brabham, born in 1926, was one of the most consistent of the Formula One drivers and was known as ?Black Jack? because of his outlook. A determined and dedicated driver, he also had a good idea of what a car should be like. He is the only driver to have won the world championship in a car bearing his own name. He and partner Ron Tauranac built the 1966 constructors' winning Brabham powered by a Repco engine. The Brabham team also won the constructors cup in 1967 this time with New Zealander Denny Hulme.<br>Brabham retired from GP racing in 1970, aged 44.<br>He competed in 126 races over 16 years, won 14 of them, took pole position 13 times and recorded the fastest lap 10 times. He amassed a total of 253 championship points.<br>In 1981 and 1983 Brabham cars powered Nelson Piquet to drivers' world championships.<br>Murray Walker<br>FORMULA One is colourful enough in itself, but TV commentator Murray Walker has added a touch of personality that few viewers can ignore.<br>Walker's most famous quote has adorned thousands of T-shirts. On the front: ?Unless I'm very much mistaken . . . ? And on the back: ?. . . yes I am very much mistaken.?<br>Here are a few Walkerisms over the years:?He's obviously gone in for a wheel change. I say obviously because I can't see it.? ?With half the race gone, there is half the race still to go.? ?Do my eyes deceive me, or is Senna's Lotus sounding rough?? ?As you look at the first four, the significant thing is that Alboreto is 5th.? ?He is shedding buckets of adrenalin in that car.?<br>?This is the third placed car about to lap the second placed car.? ?This is an interesting circuit because it has inclines, and not just up, but down as well.? ?Only a few more laps to go and then the action will begin, unless this is the action, which it is.? ?This has been a great season for Nelson Piquet, as he is now known, and always has been? ?And the first five places are filled by five different cars.? ?The lead is now 6.9 seconds. In fact it's just under 7 seconds.? ?Tambay's hopes, which were nil before, are absolutely zero now.?<br>At random<br>Lowest number of competitors: 10 (Argentina 1958)<br>Most competitors: 34 (Germany 1953)<br>Lowest number of cars at the finish: 4 (Monaco 1966)<br>Youngest champion: Emmerson Fittipaldi (aged 25, 1972)<br>Oldest: Juan Fangio (aged 46, 1957)<br>Fastest lap: 249.835kmh average (Damon Hill, Italy 1993)<br>Most wins in a season: Nigel Mansell (9, 1992), Michael Schumacher (9, 1995)<br>Most poles in a season: Mansell (14, 1992)<br>Most wins in a season for a constructor: McLaren (15, 1988)<br>HITS: Sources of information and statistics<br>http://www.ultranet.com/~mitchmcc/f1faq.htm (Formula One Frequently Asked Questions)<br>http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/%7Eaharnedy/formula1.htm (Alan's F1 Page)<br>http://www.fia.com/ (FIA homepage)<br>http://www.siii.pt/f1/w3f1/in/f1.htm (Forix: Formula One Results & Information Xplorer)<br>http://mail.descartes.co.uk/formula1/ (Formula1 Web Site)<br>http://dcpu1.cs.york.ac.uk:6666/pete/walkerisms.html (The Murray Walker Quotes Page)<br></font></p>
