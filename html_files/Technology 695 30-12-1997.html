            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>Nutrition and Food on the Web<br>Eating - we have all probably done quite enough of it on the past week. But have those festive dainties been the right things to consume? Just how are you going to get the runaway train of a body back on the tracks? Access, of course, has the answer - just go to Jean Fremont's Food and Nutrition page and read up. Here are several essays on nutrition, exercise plans and the art and science of food. There is even a guide to avoiding the worst excesses of Christmas and the New Year, though for many of you slobs it is probably far too late for that.<br>The most important message is stay balanced - don't worry too much and you and your over-supplied physique will survive. (HC)<br>The Complete Internet Search Engine Index<br>They are all here, all the big names - AltaVista, Dogpile, Yahoo. But there are plenty more search engines out there and some of them are even worth having a look at. The Complete Internet Search Engine Index contains links to more than 60 engines, from general trawlers to specialised directories. Considering finding what you want on the Net is one of the most important barriers to getting good information, this index could prove quite valuable.<br>As well as the more standard engines, good sites such as The Monster Magazine List and the Internet Sleuth are listed here. (HC)<br>Warne's World<br>Australia's master spinner Shane Warne has attracted more attention for what he eats than what he bowls recently. This site puts things back in perspective. It is an English attempt to work him out.<br>The combined resources of Wisden, the cricketer's bible, and the Guardian newspaper have been put into analysing Warne's bowling. The most interesting thing is that this site was put together for the Ashes earlier this year in England. Either Mike Atherton's men are not Net-savvy and they didn't read it, or Warne is just too good. ?Hollywood? broke their hearts as usual.<br>For cricket lovers there are animations of Warne's bowling action and deliveries on each page. The balls covered are his leg break, googly, top spinner and flipper. It is a valuable resource for youngsters wanting to learn more about the art and craft of spin bowling. (DW)<br>Mediadome<br>This site, a collaborative effort from Intel and cnet, goes further than most entertainment sites, using cutting-edge Web technologies ?to create a brand-new experience in Web-based entertainment?.<br>What this means is you had better stock up on a stack of plug-ins before you set foot in this treasure trove of video clips, animation and audio treats. QuickTime, RealPlayer, Shockwave and NetCast would be a good start.In its Webisodes, Mediadome takes users behind the scenes of recent movies such as Titanic and Spawn. In the latter, you can sample the soundtrack and meet the special effects wizards. In the animation section, you can follow the series Fabian's Clueless Mysteries, meet top animators in RealVideo interviews and tour some of the best animation sites on the Web.There are also Webisodes for musicians such as The Rolling Stones (their Bridges to Babylon Web press conference is archived here) and Fiona Apple. Mediadome is bandwidth and memory-intensive so a minimum 28.8Kbps modem is a must. (SY)<br>Reach Out! Youth Suicide Prevention Web Site<br>Thanks to the generosity of listeners who donated to youth radio network Triple J's Real Appeal, the Reach Out! youth suicide prevention service has been able to launch its Web site, called Chill Out! Although only in a pilot phase until a bigger site is launched in March, the site already has an abundance of information to help troubled youth, such as guides to services available, the sort of people you can turn to and how to help a friend in need. There's also an area where you can scream out your frustrations or share your dreams.<br>Reach Out! executive director Jack Heath said as many as 40 young Australians attempt suicide each day and the anonimity of the Net provides a great opportunity to reach out to those in need. The site does not offer online counselling and advises people in crisis to phone Lifeline or the Kids Help Line, the numbers for which are prominently displayed.<br>Chill Out! is an initiative of the New Australia Foundation, a non-profit organisation aimed at promoting national healing with an emphasis on youth suicide prevention. Corporate sponsorship is being sought to help maintain planned extra Reach Out! services such as the Who Cares database, where troubled youth will be able to enter their addresses and be directed to the nearest relevant help service. (SY)<br>Arts Home Pages<br>Popular or junk culture can sometimes appear to overwhelm the Web. The Simpsons, X Files, Star Trek, the Spice Girls ? you can always find plenty about them. But what about the arts? Classical music, opera, literature, drama, sculpture and so forth. Actually they are well represented too.<br>This Melbourne site attempts to guide surfers to places where they might find some enrichment or a break from the fast food world. Some links are broken but overall it is quite comprehensive for the arts in Australia. Topics covered and/or linked to include: concerts, exhibitions, opera, ballet, musical instruments, books, CDs, tickets and education about the arts.
