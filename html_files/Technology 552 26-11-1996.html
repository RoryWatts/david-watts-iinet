            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET interest in the December 14 State election experienced a minor growth spurt late last week.<br>The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats had been the only major political forces using the World Wide Web to try to help their political causes. Both had simple sites.<br>But the WA branch of the Liberal Party shook off tentativeness last Thursday to say it had a Web site. It turned out pretty well.<br>Then the WA Electoral Commission revamped its rather stuffy page last Friday. In a show of independence their Federal colleagues must be accustomed to, the WA Liberals rejected offers from the national office to be incorporated in the Canberra site which has barely altered since the March election.<br>It was a wise move. Liberal State Council Internet project leader Steve Blizzard - who wears so many party hats he forgets all of them - has overseen a simple, effective site which not only presents party policy, but is also starting to offer it in a context that only the Web can deliver.<br>For example, what could be dry policy statements on the Bungle Bungles incorporate links to World Heritage sites.<br>And the Liberals, to date, are one of the few parties to admit there is a wider world of politics. The State page has a link to David Moss's Australian Politics site which offers links to nearly every political animal in Australia, including the arch enemy, the ALP.<br>Mr Moss is a card-carrying Liberal Party official, but maintains a site respected by psephologists who use the Net for its objectivity.<br>One of the eye-openers from the Liberal site is a link to Premier Richard Court's Insite page, on the WA Government server.<br>In contrast to his own party's austere and simple presentation, Mr Court's site is one of the most graphically rich political sites that WestWeb has seen. It takes about two minutes to download at 28.8Kbps and with 16Mb of memory, so it is not a place to visit for those in a hurry.<br>The site justifies the Premier's statement on it: ?The Internet is allowing us to do things that just a few years ago were thought impossible.?<br>No Cabinet member gets the same treatment. Their Government-maintained sites are simple by comparison.<br>The Liberals appear to be ahead in using the Net as an information delivery tool, but are still behind Labor in employing the medium's democratic interactivity possibilities.<br>One of the areas that Labor stuck its neck out with during the Federal campaign was a feedback site known as Soapbox.<br>This allowed Net users to voice their opinions on any subject and have them posted in open forum.<br>Almost half the postings were critical of Labor policy, particularly of former prime minister Paul Keating's personality.<br>The party admitted such open discussion was part of the price of a democratic society.<br>Soapbox is starting to carry quite a few comments about the WA election even though it is accessible only from the Federal site.<br>The Electoral Commission is now a must-visit site for surfers genuinely interested in the election. It carries full information on candidates, electorates, polling places and returning officers, and will carry results on the big day.<br>Web technology has filtered through to a few candidates. The Liberal member for Whitford, Rob Johnson, who is endorsed as the candidate for Hillarys in this election, has an excellent, long-standing site with a variety of good links.<br>Other candidates like Margot Ross, running as an independent in Riverton, and Katie Hodson-Thomas, Liberal candidate for Carine, have simpler home pages stating their aims.<br>URLs:<br>Liberal Party - www.wa.liberal.eepo.com.au (this will change to www.wa.liberal.org.au soon)<br>Richard Court Insite page - www.wa.gov.au/cabinet/court/gfx/index-gfx.html<br>Labor Party - www.wa.alp.org.au<br>Soapbox - www.alp.org.au/soapbox.htm<br>Democrats - www.democrats.org.au/wa<br>WA Electoral Commission - www.waec.wa.gov.au/<br>Rob Johnson, MLA - www.iinet.net.au/~rjohnson/<br>Margot Ross - http://www.iinet.net.au/~margross/<br>Katie Hodson-Thomas - link from Liberal site.<br>General political resources:<br>Australian Politics - netspace.net.au/%7Emalcolm/auspol.htm<br>Palmer's Australian Politics Pages - www.pcug.org.au/~bpalmer/<br>WA Government:<br>www.wa.gov.au<br></font></p>
