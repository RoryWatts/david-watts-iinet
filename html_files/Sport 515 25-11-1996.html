            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS is more like it. Since Friday, true couch potatoes have had cricket and golf - the most gentlemanly of pursuits - to keep them company.<br>And both the first Test between Australia and the West Indies from Brisbane and the Australian Open golf from Sydney have been extremely watchable.<br>Neither have been particularly gentlemanly, but no sport is at this level.<br>These arenas are for the hard-hearted and pragmatic, occasionally for the adventurous. There is no place for niceties or dreams. Fairytales in sport happen rarely.<br>Victorian opener Matthew Elliott found the transition to Test cricket more a nightmare. All resemblance to Bill Lawry evaporated when the tall, skinny Victorian made a fidgety duck in front of 16,000 Gabbaites who wanted to see Matthew Hayden, or Michael Slater at the very least, in his place. It came about because no one told Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh they were supposed to be spent forces.<br>Elliott joined some great names with his duck on debut. Victor Trumper, Syd Gregory, Ken Barrington and Graham Gooch have all had the same fate, as have Michael Atherton and Mike Brearley.<br>Ken Mueleman and Jack Moroney are the other Australian openers to go scoreless in their first innings.<br>For Elliott's sake, let us hope he does not suffer a short Test career like other very good Sheffield Shield batsmen including Wally Edwards, Bruce Francis, Graeme Thomas and present selector Andrew Hilditch.<br>One man who won't have to worry about Test selection for some time is Ian Healy.<br>The inelegant spooner, swisher, slasher and shoveller could not have chosen a better time, with his 161 not out, to become Australia's highest scoring wicketkeeper and the first native Queenslander to score a century at the Gabba.<br>Like another Queensland wicketkeeper of the past, Wally Grout, Healy has had to suffer the rumour mill that has Adam Gilchrist stepping up very soon. Healy showed what he thought of that.<br>Channel Nine's coverage has been first class. The replays get better and even the much-criticised commentary seems to have mellowed.<br>We had Ian Chappell telling us he had his last cup of tea in England in 1963, Lawry - a great batsman - attacking the front-foot no-ball rule for disadvantaging bowlers, and Michael Holding - a great fast bowler - defending it on behalf of batsmen.<br>Channel Seven's golf coverage was also good. Greg Norman's victory looked inevitable after his five-under first round and the drenching, foul weather of Friday which made conditions unpleasant and at times unplayable.<br>Forced to finish his second round at 7am on the third day, Norman looked rightly tired and crabby towards the end.<br>Tiger Woods just looked defeated despite coming back from his disastrous day one.<br></font></p>
