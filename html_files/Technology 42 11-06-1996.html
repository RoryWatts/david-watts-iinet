            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE'S two-year domination of World Wide Web browser use is under serious threat with the beta release of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3.0.<br>Explorer is a thing of beauty which Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates hopes will be a joy for ever in the hottest Net market.<br>The beta of Explorer 3.0 contains its fair share of annoying bugs but demonstrates a long list of features that leave the previous Explorer 2.0 eating dust.<br>Version 2.0, packaged with Windows 95, is a competent but unremarkable browser that is a long second to Netscape Navigator in all releases worldwide.<br>But version 3.0, which Microsoft expects to release fully - and cost free - about September, is an exponential improvement with thrilling possibilities.<br>Explorer is less chunky than Netscape, far prettier and has the potential to support as big a range of video, audio and Java applications.<br>It supports frames at last and will be able to translate Web pages into 23 different languages.<br>For example, a previously unreadable Web page in Japanese will be able to be viewed in English.<br>It also supports the PICS rating standard which will allow parents, teachers or system managers to use password security to block access to sites they consider objectionable.<br>At the heart of Explorer is the ability to link with Microsoft's ActiveX architecture, allowing multimedia programs to come into play on the Net.<br>Explorer will also support Java applets that allow connections to programs on other computers on the Web.<br>ActiveX, despite its attractions, looms as a controversial issue.<br>It relies on links to programs which in the main reside on hard disks and will need lots of workarounds to become portable with the Mac.<br>It also puts the onus back on a user's computer rather than the reliance on the Net as an operating system that has been the buzz with Netscape and Java.<br>Given that Explorer 3.0 will certainly become an integral part of Windows 95 and given that more and more new PCs have 95 as their standard operating system, Microsoft will make big inroads on the Net.<br>With such an attractive browser to plug in so easily, many users will see little reason to seek and download Netscape.<br>But that possible scenario is some months off. In the meantime Microsoft is still well behind Netscape in important ways.<br>News and mail are two great features of Netscape. They have improved dramatically in Netscape 2.0 and beyond.<br>In fact Netscape Mail is one of the highlights of the program, allowing display of graphics and easy linking to Web sites - they appear straight in the mail if sent using the ?mail document? feature.<br>Mail and news are packaged within Netscape. Explorer needs a user to download Microsoft Mail and News - neither quite as good as Netscape - install and configure as default programs to use with Explorer.<br>But Explorer does have the capacity to beguile on what may be superficial, but still important, levels.<br>The browser looks attractive and can be personalised quite easily, allowing users to display a host of favourite links on startup.<br>Microsoft's HTML extensions mean Web pages can look more attractive with the use of the <font face> command. If a Web page with this in operation is viewed on Explorer it is significantly more attractive than on Netscape.<br>Australian users who have downloaded Explorer 3.0 are almost universal in their belief that the browser will be a threat to Netscape.<br>Opinion in newsgroups like alt.news.microsoft is that more work is obviously needed.<br>Explorer appears confused by local files, sometimes even refusing to react when one is typed into the URL location box.<br>Some framed pages turn out back to front on Explorer. For example, a 20 per cent wide frame appears 80 per cent and vice-versa. Some pages - and ironically Microsoft's much touted personalised home page is a main offender - just won't appear or work, according to users.<br>Explorer 3.0 is not available for the Macintosh yet, but Microsoft is certain to be working on that given the very favourable review of Explorer 2.0 in the latest MacUser magazine. Explorer shared a points decision with Netscape as best browser for the Mac.<br>The clever ability of Explorer on installation to take Netscape bookmarks and import them into the ?favourites? folder is loathed as much as it is admired.<br>One user said it felt like Bill Gates was intruding on his computer.<br>And up to last week the program had to be downloaded from Microsoft's US site and was not available at the Australian site.<br>URL: http://www.microsoft.com/ie/<br></font></p>
