            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIAN opening bowler Glenn McGrath bats with a naked blade.<br>As his team's greatest rabbit, it would seem embarrassing to have a sponsor emblazoned on willow responsible for an average of about 3.00. But McGrath was no Robinson Crusoe at the MCG on Saturday.<br>All the Australian bats could easily have been shaved clean as Curtly Ambrose awoke from a month-long sleep to confirm his standing as the West Indies' most potent paceman.<br>The pitch was cracking rapidly, the Windies decided they could field, and Kenny Benjamin and skipper Courtney Walsh backed Ambrose with mighty spells. But the Australians had one of those collective lemming rushes to collapse that used to symbolise clashes with the Windies in the late 70s and most of the 80s.<br>Saturday was just like the old days - the bad, old days. The second innings effort of 122 by Mark Taylor's men was up (or rather down) there with the worst. Channel Nine rubbed salt in by showing a table of Australia's worst scores against the Windies. At the time of showing it was 7-95; but Nine's team obviously didn't think there were many more runs to be had.<br>Richie Benaud made either the very sage, or very stupid remark: ?Eighty-seven (the Windies target) doesn't look like a lot to chase. And in fact it's not.?<br>Benaud is seldom fazed by Test cricket's capacity for random chaos. He takes it all with the merest hint of a wry grin and continues to speak in those clipped tones, mimicked by dozens of would-be comedians and advertisers.<br>He is so cool when all around start to speculate and lose the plot. West Indies commentator Colin Croft, delighted by Ambrose's spell and Australia's discomfort, was singing like a bird about the charming Melbourne weather and the ideal setting for a Test as Sherwin Campbell and Robert Samuels started the inevitable chase for victory.<br>But for some reason co-commentator Tony Greig got it in his head that Croft was misinformed, that this was no fait accompli ... in short the opera wasn't over until the fat lady sang.<br>As a television spectacle it was a dud of course, leaving two empty days and a feeling of having been cheated out of festive fare.<br>In cricket terms, however, the Test was an important catalyst for a much needed West Indies revival.<br>???<br>IF CRICKET is a funny old game, then English soccer isn't far behind.<br>The ABC's Premier League show last week featured last-placed Nottingham Forest's 3-1 win over second-placed Arsenal.<br>It was Forest's first home victory of the season. But the confrontation between Arsenal and England teammates Ian Wright and Paul Merson caused most talk.<br>Wright backheeled the ball to no one in particular, stopping a promising Arsenal move.<br>Merson appeared to say something and Wright chased him at full speed, jumped into his back and gave him a mouthful.<br>Later, Wright was sent off for clipping an opponent behind the ear. The first to remonstrate with the referee and give moral support was Merson.<br></font></p>
