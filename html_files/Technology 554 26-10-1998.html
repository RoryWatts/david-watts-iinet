            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE of the marks of the clever and witty person is the memorable and relevant quote.<br>You know the types - the dinner guest who can give you Hamlet's soliloquy without stuttering; the one who starts a sentence with ?was it Thomas Aquinas who said??, even the eager beaver who can rattle off the relevant section of the Act dealing with sub-divisions.<br>But who needs them? What this column is more concerned with is the average clever and witty person.<br>And that means a reliance on modern junk culture like the words of top 40 hits, quotes from the movies, and even inventive telephone answering messages.<br>As fate would have it, the Web has resources for all of them. (Just so we won't marginalise the Shakespeare-Aquinas types, it also has plenty for you, too).<br>If you want to charm friends and acquaintances with apt quotes from the movies, the best place to look is the same spot you will find almost everything to do with film - the Internet Movie Database.<br>IMDb has a special Quotes Browser area where users can choose a letter of the alphabet and look at all the films that start with that letter and have quotable quotes.<br>The number of quotable entries is well below the 170,749 titles for which IMDb has listings in its general section. But you can still spend weeks chuckling at the lines from thousands of films.<br>If you are looking for something clever from The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, you are out of luck.<br>But there is this entry for the 1987 worthy, Assault of the Killer Bimbos - Restaurant patron: Oh no! A bimbo with a gun, Peaches: Eat lead, Bozos!<br>You can even find Disney films where animated characters are capable of great wisdom, and the bulk of the famous dead parrot skit from the Monty Python film, And Now For Something Completely Different.<br>If music is more your scene, the Web crawls with lyrics.<br>One site of particular junky interest is Top 40 Hits of 1930-1998. This is not a collection of the best 40 songs of that time, but a library containing the words of more than 11,000 songs that made the Billboard top 40 chart in the US.<br>The first song of 1930 listed is Beyond The Blue Horizon, sung by Jeanette MacDonald. She performed it in the 1944 film Follow the Boys.<br>It starts:<br>Blow, whistle blow away,<br>Blow away the past.<br>Go engine anywhere.<br>I don't care how fast.<br>The last entry in the library is not from 1998 . . . yet. The site is a work in progress and had made it to 1995 last week.<br>The last song there is Madonna's Something to Remember.<br>In between, you can find nearly everything memorable, and many just too awful (Honey, by Bobby Goldsboro, for example).<br>But it is a top 40 library and misses many real gems and, being American, many great Australian and British songs as well.<br>For those, you should try the Lyrics Library, an awesomely big collection of lyrics mostly gathered and contributed by the users of the Web.<br>Shy clever people might prefer to let their telephone answering machines do the talking. A British site called The Answering Machine provides dozens of free, downloadable audio files that can be converted for use as telephone answering messages.<br>For example, you could have Arnie Schwarzenegger saying: ?Don't terminate your message . . . I'll be back.?<br></font></p>
