            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>Killer Fonts<br>Computers in general, and e-mail in particular, may have obliterated the handwritten letter but they also enable us to express ourselves more graphically. Killer Fonts goes the extra step by turning famous - and infamous - handwriting into typefaces.The idea of being able to correspond via the quill of Thomas Jefferson or Beethoven or da Vinci is intriguing. Or, as the name killerfonts.com implies, you can send that letter to the editor in the scrawled style of Billy the Kid.Site creators Stuart Shapiro and L. Theodore Ollier have weighted the historical figure hands in favour of scoundrels such as the Zodiac Killer. Still, the most popular sellers are Jefferson, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Jack the Ripper. (WP)<br>Quandary Game Reviews<br>If the idea of shooting your opponents to death in a dungeon-like atmosphere or running them off a racetrack doesn't do anything for you -but putting your grey matter to the test does - this local site may be worth a look.Quandary's focus is reviewing adventure, strategy, role-playing and, occasionally, children's games. The current edition features games such as The Curse of Monkey Island and Zork Grand Inquisitor. The game reviews are thorough but the images are too small to be of any great value (giving the option of linking to a bigger image would be useful).Quandary has had four issues a year since 1995 and the back issues are all online. Not much has changed about the simple, mostly text interface since then other than the background colour switching from grey to white.The site is the baby of Gordon Aplin and Rosemary Young, who say they began playing computer games in 1987 ?after discovering the quite wonderful Zork text adventures from Infocom?. So if you're after an alternative to Quake, drop by here for ideas. (SY)<br>International Save the Pun Foundation<br>Last Wednesday's top puns were: ?Dieting is the punishment you get for exceeding the feed limit"; and ?Fat, the phrase that launched a thousand hips?. There are dozens more awful groan-makers but there is method in the madness.<br>This site is run by the International Save The Pun Foundation, founded in 1979 by the late John Crosbie. The foundation believes puns are necessary because one in five Americans is a functional illiterate, so it tries to arouse a greater interest in reading by encouraging people to have fun with words.<br>The history of punning (or paronomasia) at the site claims the origins can be traced to the Bible and names Shakespeare and Boswell as great practitioners of the art. Links will take you to the puns of the week and of the day and there is a feedback spot for your own efforts. (DW)<br>WA Film and Video Club<br>If you fancy yourself as a budding director and want to meet like-minded individuals, drop by the home of the WA Film and Video Club, submitted by reader Len Varley.The multitude of photos on the main page was a bit off putting for the first-time visitor -but keep scrolling to the bottom and you'll get to the link to the information page. There you will learn that the club, originally known as the Amateur Cine Society, was formed more than 50 years ago, in the days of 8 and 16mm film. Today, the club has less members and video cameras are the favoured medium but many members have expertise in 8mm, Hi 8, VHS and S-VHS. Some still use Cine film. The club meets on the second Tuesday of the month in Claremont. (SY)<br>Titanic<br>The ?unsinkable? ship has been the subject of many documentaries, books and films but James Cameron's three-hour epic romantic drama really takes the cake. At the now mandatory film Web site, you can take QuickTime VR tours of various areas of the Titanic such as the grand staircase or a first-class suite.There are interviews with the cast and Cameron, screensavers, desktop diaries and screen patterns to download (for PC and Mac) plus shots of the real Titanic in her watery grave. This is a very impressive site but you would expect nothing less from a film reputed to be the most expensive ever made. (SY)<br>The Ultimate Guide to 007<br>Some may say, ?Ho-hum, another year, another Bond film?. But somehow the magic of suave, old 007 never seems to vanish completely. This site is full of goodies and each page is introduced with a little Bond audio clip. ?Good morning Moneypenny? or ?The name's Bond, James Bond? cause a ripple of familiar delight.<br>The first 17 Bond films are reviewed in frank detail with full cast lists and production credits. This sample from Timothy Dalton's attempt in The Living Daylights shows what is on offer:<br>?The Bond of The Living Daylights is warm and twinkly toward his leading lady; he is appalled when a colleague is murdered; he has spasms of doubt whether he's killing the right people. Many people thought he was a big girl's blouse.?<br>There are also links to henchmen, interesting deaths and famous Bond sexual innuendos (called Tittle Tattle). One section - Chocolate Bond - is an in-depth interview with Australia's George Lazenby who fell from favour spectacularly after his one go at being 007 in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. (DW)<br>The Field Guide to the North American Male<br>The basic premise of the field guide is that it would be ?lovely if the world of men were as neatly classifiable as that of the animal kingdom?. It then attempts to classify men - though they are North Americans the classifications are universal - as an ornithologist would birds.<br>More than 50 species are described with details of plumage, mating calls, sexual displays, courtship rituals and habitats. A comprehensive Q and A session even tries to explain why many species of male play pretend guitars at certain times of their lives. (DW)<br>The Antenna<br>If the model for the Web is moving inexorably toward that of television, what better and more depressing symbol of this evolution can there be than The Antenna, a site devoted to collecting the sites of US local TV news operations?Tune to The Antenna for quick access to the kidnappings, slayings, and weather catastrophes that make up the sleazy menu of local TV news. Check out the top sites and you'll quickly learn the dark secret of virtually all news sites on the Web - they are creative repackagings of the Associated Press wire complete with TV lingo - "We've learned??, ?We'll have the latest?"It is the place to see just what sheep local TV news operations are - the salt and pepper anchors, the Doppler radar, the abandonment of serious reporting on local affairs. Look particularly at the work of the various ?current affairs? shows; no matter what the city, it's those dirty restaurants, speed traps, and stolen car chop shops that dominate. Those stories, up next. (WP)<br>LA Times-Washington Post (WP)<br></font></p>
