            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Specialised searching is well catered for on the Net. These are just a few sites that can refine your searches to a specific topic. There is no need to plug in a word and hope that a big engine or directory finds what you want in the first 20 pages of results.<br>Movies:<br>The Internet Movie Data Base has user-supplied details of more than 50,000 films and even some TV shows. You can search for titles, actors, crew, genres or even dates and locations. You can submit information or rate the movies: us.imdb.com/search or ballet.cit.gu.edu.au/Movies/search.html<br>The Movie Review Query Engine lets you look for film reviews published online.<br>www.cinema.pgh.pa.us/movie/reviews<br>Television:<br>The Ultimate TV List keeps track of thousands of shows by asking users to submit details like URLs of home pages for F-Troop, for example. An engine on site allows you to ask for details of a specific show. Results returned include FAQs and Usenet newsgroups as well as Web sites.<br>www.ultimatetv.com/UTVL/<br>Software:<br>Download.com is, as its name suggests, part of the cnet empire. Key in the name of a<br>program, even in a fairly abstract way, and it will give you details of where to download it, as well as a capsule review, but only if the program is in its own archives.<br>www.download.com<br>TUCOWS or The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software does a similar job. The Australian mirror sites can present fast results. The search button is not on the front page but click the links to operating systems and it is at the bottom of the page. tucows.ois.net.au<br>Phone numbers and addresses:<br>Telstra White Pages and Yellow Pages cover both telephone directories for all states.<br>www.whitepages.com.au and<br>www.yellowpages.com.au<br>E-mail addresses:<br>Sofcom offers many directories. This one can search for e-mail addresses if they have been submitted.<br>www.sofcom.com/Directories/<br>EMAIL.AU.html<br>Netscape people finder is available from the directory menu on the Navigator 3.0 toolbar or under guide on Communicator. It includes Bigfoot, WhoWhere?, Four11 and InfoSpace.<br>All can seek global e-mails.<br>guide.netscape.com/guide/people.html<br>This list barely scrapes the surface. Recommendations for other search tools are welcomed. Just e-mail watto@iinet.net.au or access@wanews.com.au.<br></font></p>
