            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE eyes of the world have focused firmly on the fly of US President Bill Clinton for two weeks now. Not much has come out of it . . . um, the affair of the Smoking Trousers I mean.<br>It has actually led to an increase in Mr Clinton's popularity, according to opinion polls, and one wonders whether he will take that as an invitation for more of the same.<br>Residents of Iraq may well wish Mr Clinton would leave the girls alone. Every time he allegedly cuddles one, they live in fear that bombs will be dropped on their heads to draw flak away from the President.<br>Zippergate - as the alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky is often called - is striking evidence of the boredom inherent in both democracy in an affluent country and a slow news day. It has been reported that reports of the affair outnumbered those on the death of Princess Diana, and even out-rated interest in the Super Bowl.It has spawned thousands of jokes, hardly any of which are suitable for reproduction in a family publication. One that is:Q: What is Bill's definition of safe sex?<br>A: When Hillary is out of town. Or,<br>Q. What does Bill say to Hillary after sex?A: ?Honey, I'll be home in 20 minutes.?<br>But, this column has nothing to do with the affair of the Smoking Trousers. That was just a cunning ruse to get you to look at my holiday slides.They are not really slides, of course; more like random memories from a delightful week away on Rottnest:<br>F Many people take mobile phones to Rotto. Despite appearances this is not to keep up their yuppie lifestyle nor workaholic nature.Many mobile yappers find a nice, high point on the island, like the cliffs at Bathurst Point where good reception is assured, and where there is a clear view across the sparkling blue water to Perth - it's as though one is looking straight down St Georges Terrace.<br>THEY then dial the number and after a short delay, this is what they say: ?Hi, I'm on Rotto, looking straight across at you in Perth. It's beaut. Nyaah, nyaah, nah, nah, nah.?<br>It takes about a day to get used to the fact that people look quite normal with bicycle helmets glued permanently to their head. That is, unless they are of a rebellious age - say 16-25 - when they go bare-headed but have a helmet dangling from their handlebars just in case.<br>After all, the warning at the North Port ferry terminal could not be clearer. A big sign shouts: Bicycle Helmets Are Compulsory. In fact - and this is probably evidence of affluence again - the sign is similar to one at the Sentosa ferry terminal in Singapore that says: NO SMOKING. $5000 FINE.This sign is about three times the size of the one at the Fremantle terminal but then Singapore is about three times the size of Perth.<br>Many things can kill or maim you on and around Rotto - sharks, rays, rips etc. But outside of the forces of nature you can also face death or injury a) by jumping the queue at the bakery or b) being older than 30 at the Quokka Arms on holiday weekends.<br>Children who try to turn off Pat Rafter, on the TV hired solely to watch tennis, in favour of some dreadful American show, can be dealt with by short, sharp, angry words, such as: ?If I hear any more whingeing, it's off, you're out, OK.? Nothing like a growl to get them out in the fresh air.<br>You might stay on the island only six days but telling friends who did not go how good it was will take about 10 days. Overall Rotto is a very predictable place . . . it's beaut.<br></font></p>
