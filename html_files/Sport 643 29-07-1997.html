            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BEWARE of marketing hype, especially on TV.<br>All last week viewers were led to believe the Bledisloe Cup rugby clash between Australia and New Zealand at the MCG would be the greatest thing since William Webb Ellis disrupted a school soccer game by picking up the ball and running with it.<br>It was not, unless you were an All Black supporter. In fact it was more a case of great fireworks, shame about the game.<br>NZ's powerful 33-18 victory simply asserted the dominance that only the most optimistic had doubted.<br>The crowd was supposed to make a difference, so was the tinderbox atmosphere. They might have done so if the Wallabies had been playing nearly anyone but Sean Fitzpatrick's spoilsport team of hard tacklers.<br>What seemed conveniently forgotten in the lead-up was that the Wallabies have been struggling to form a coherent backline and that the forwards have failed to mix it with the likes of Ian Jones, Olo Brown and Zinzan Brooke for some time.<br>A mythical figure of a 100,000 crowd was supposed to make a miracle. That figure was quoted often by Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett - as big a hyper as there is to be found in Australia - and had no basis in fact.<br>The MCG's capacity is a shade over 95,000. About 3000 members opted not to be seen as traitors so the actual crowd became 90,000 - still a rugby record and still capable of producing an electric atmosphere.<br>Channel 7 claimed 2.3 million viewers and must be pleased that its hype worked.<br>And future contests will even the score and provide better spectacles.<br>They might also be less disrupted by the referee's whistle. Englishman Ed Morrison obviously enjoyed being the centre of attention in front of such a vast crowd.<br>The marketing hype for next Sunday's Dockers-Eagles derby has started in earnest.<br>Seven is calling it the ultimate showdown, which is a bit rich. In AFL terms there is only one ultimate showdown, the grand final.<br>At least it promises to be much closer and harder to pick than Australia-NZ, although West Coast was ominous against Geelong.<br>Even though Fremantle pulled off a treat of a win against Hawthorn - one of the best heart-attack efforts yet - it might find West Coast has forged a much tougher outfit through the adversity of weeks of injury.<br>TV viewers will hope Don Scott does not take up the microphone for the clash. At one stage against the Hawks he could not tell the difference between Dale Kickett, Gary Dhurrkay or Scott Chisholm.<br>The very least a footy commentator has to do is look at the number on the back of the jumper, then at the Football Record. Thousands in the stands find it a relatively easy task.<br></font></p>
