            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS being the Internet, the biggest section of cliches is reserved for computers. In films, computers always have the following properties:<br>Monitors always display inch-high letters; commands are in plain English (eg: get the secret files); no one ever makes a typing mistake or paradoxically uses the space bar when typing at high speed; when the power plant or mission control is the scene of a battle, all the computers will explode; when a computer malfunctions you can tell by the puff of smoke coming from the screen.<br>The list goes on and it's addictive as are all the sections. Consider these random selections:<br>ANIMALS - the snake will always bite the heroine first even if she is surrounded by 30 men.<br>ENVIRONMENT - thunder and lightning always happen at the same time.<br>HELICOPTERS - bad guys' helicopters explode in flames when they malfunction while good guys' copters drift to the ground where the hero emerges slightly scratched but without a hair out of place.<br>HEROES - go without food or sleep for 72 hours straight. The only injuries they get in fights are small cuts at the corner of the mouth which they wipe with the back of the hand.<br>HOUSES - all Paris apartments have a view of the Eiffel Tower.<br>PHONES - all numbers begin with 555.<br>RADIO - the radio will be turned on just as a special announcement about escaped lunatics is made.<br>SHOPPING - bags of groceries are always made of brown paper and have celery sticking out the top. Something always falls out of them when they're brought home.<br>SMOKING - smokers only light up a cigarette at dramatic or romantic moments, otherwise they have no craving for nicotine.<br>Internet users can e-mail their favourites to http://www.well.com/user/vertigo/cliches.html.<br>I'm going to add - all animated dogs always steal perfect strings of sausages from butchers, who are always big, hairy and possibly Italian.<br>And ... you can always tell when the movie is set in Australia, because the Sydney Harbour Bridge will appear even if the bulk of the action is in the outback.<br></font></p>
