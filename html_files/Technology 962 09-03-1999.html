            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE problems of finding the most-visited Web sites in Australia appear to have grown, despite the emergence of a new player in a field becoming more important to e-commerce.<br>American group Web21, which runs the 100hot lists, began compiling data on Australian sites recently. Its rankings join Where Did We Go and AAA as attempts to tell Net users the most popular sites, and thus possibly the most profitable places for advertisers to place banners or push services.<br>But neither 100hot nor Where Did We Go can agree on the rankings.<br>AAA appears a less serious list. An announcement at its home page tells surfers it has no intention of producing a list based on ?exact popularity? because this would be ?absurd?.<br>That leaves 100hot and Where Did We Go as possible sources of important data.<br>100hot suffers an immediate problem because of its US heritage. Its latest list of the top sites declares that rankings are for ?Fall 1999?, ignoring the fact that in Australia we have autumn and not the Americanised season.<br>Its latest top 10 is: OzEmail, AltaVista Yellowpages, iiNet (the big Perth ISP), Monash University, University of Sydney, Sydney Morning Herald, Australian Stock Exchange, www.tig.com.au, www.powerup.com.au, and the Melbourne Age.<br>By contrast, the latest Where Did We Go top 10 is: Ninemsn (Channel 9 and Microsoft), Comsec (the Commonwealth Bank's online brokerage), White Pages, Yahoo Australia, News Corporation's newspapers, Yellow Pages, the ABC, Sydney Morning Herald, Australian Stock Exchange and Fairfax online classifieds.<br>There is little common ground with only three sites - the stock exchange, Sydney Morning Herald and Yellow Pages - in both lists.<br>Web21 says it collects data from many different sources for 100hot. It mostly uses the logs from proxy servers of selected ISPs, and says the figures collected represent the surfing patterns of more than 100,000 people around the world.<br>About 60 per cent of sampling is done in the US for American-centred lists, but Web21 has decided to leave out users connected to the giant ISPs AOL, Prodigy and Compuserve.<br>Its Australian figures are derived from a much smaller sample. High rankings by ISP home pages at OzEmail and iiNet may indicate heavy use of supplied home pages by customers of those services.<br>OzEmail and Monash University - which both feature in the hot100 top 10 - are the only Australian sites that make the top 500 (in the world) at Relevant Knowledge's Media Metrix, regarded by many online critics as one of the more authoritative lists of popularity.<br>Where Did We Go also says its figures are compiled from proxy log files at a range of ISPs in all States.<br>More than 70 million accesses a week - about 2.5 per cent of all Web traffic generated by Australians - are analysed. Rankings are based on requests to Web servers from Australians only. They do not measure all traffic to any site.<br>An explanation at the Where Did We Go site says some Australian sites receive more than 50 per cent of traffic from overseas.<br>The failure to develop an agreed standard for Web traffic measurement is regarded as a continuing problem on the Net.<br>A year ago, the search engine AltaVista was upset that competitors Yahoo and Excite kept attracting most media attention even though AltaVista estimated it was getting 10 million visitors a month.<br>AltaVista asked Relevant Knowledge to estimate its traffic based on new TV-ratings-like methodology. But Relevant Knowledge's measurements showed AltaVista had only five million visitors a month. By that time, the search engine's own methods of traffic measurement showed an audience that had grown to more than 20 million a month.<br>The New York Times commented last year that the dispute, and many others like it, demonstrated how contentious audience measurement had become.<br>New York research firm Jupiter Communications has estimated that sites rated in the top 10 take 52 per cent of Net advertising.<br>HELP DESK<br>hot100:<br>www2.web21.com/world/<br>australia/au/<br>Where Did We Go:<br>usrwww.mpx.com.au/~ianw/<br>Relevant Knowledge's<br>Media Metrix:<br>www.relevantknowledge.com<br></font></p>
