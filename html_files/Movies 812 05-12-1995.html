            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Virtuosity (MA)<br>Denzel Washington, Kelly Lynch<br>Russell Crowe<br>Directed by Brett Leonard<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>BY THE fifth or sixth Jaffa, something started to smell. It wasn't me. I'd washed and had a change of clothes somewhere in the past 24 hours. It wasn't the other 10 patrons lounging around the cinema at the afternoon session.<br>Then, it occurred to me it had to be something on the big screen. Virtuosity had been running reasonably well for about half an hour. Lots of virtual reality shoot-outs and grim jail scenes in 1999 Los Angeles.<br>The grimly handsome and sweating Denzel Washington (of Glory and Crimson Tide) was being grimly handsome as Parker Barnes, an LA cop jailed for murdering a vicious serial killer who had blasted Barnes's wife and child.<br>Russell Crowe (Romper Stomper, The Quick and the Dead) was having smarmy, exuberant fun as Sid 6.7, a computer-generated baddie, composite of the personalities of 183 serial killers.<br>Up to this point, Sid was safely tucked away in a virtual reality game in which he was the perennially elusive target for LA police on training exercises.<br>But as things move from the virtual to the real world, they get silly, out of hand really.<br>Darryl Lindenmeyer (Steven Spinella), the weak and warped computer genius who created Sid, decides to spring him from the virtual to the real.<br>With the help of a brilliant scientist who Lindenmeyer dupes with sexual fantasy - the only sex in an otherwise blokes' action movie - Sid's program is put in an incubator, where it grows into a cocoon from which a flesh-and-blood Sid emerges.<br>The smelly thing about all this is the seriousness with which everyone involved takes all this absolute tosh and gibberish.<br>The cocoon looks like gift wrapping, not a patch on the one from which the gorgeous alien in another bad movie, Species, emerged.<br>Virtuosity would have been OK with this painful lack of scientific credibility - how do you turn an inorganic program into a living, breathing human? - if it had a sense of humour.<br>Instead, as Sid predictably wreaks murderous mayhem wherever he goes and Barnes is conditionally released from jail to track him down, the whole cast gets terribly serious and the plot thickens like crust on a custard - yuk.<br>Virtuosity then turns from nonsensical sci-fi into routine action, albeit with a good amount of blood. After all, among Sid's personalities are Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson, and of course the man who killed Barnes's wife and child.<br>Criminal psychologist Madison Carter, played with little-girl-lost vacancy by Kelly Lynch, joins Barnes on Sid's trail, and in the end we have a race against the clock to stop Carter's child suffering an explosive fate.<br>It's the type of man-against-time-bomb that's been going on for years. Superman used to do it every other day to save Lois and/or Jimmy in the 50s television series. James Bond did it to save the world in Goldfinger.<br>What might have been good becomes dull and predictable with good acting by Washington and Crowe wasted on the script of Eric Bernt.<br>The only fun comes near the end, with Sid lying in a dozen pieces on the floor, still alive and vicious.<br>He resembles nothing more than one of my favourite heroes, the Black Knight, from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, who, having been reduced to only a head in a vicious sword fight, yells at the victorious knight: ?Come back you coward and I'll bite your ankles.?<br></font></p>
