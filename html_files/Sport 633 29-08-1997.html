            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS column was supposed to be about funny things that doctors say. It will have to wait. I am angry this week and here is why:<br>IT MUST be embarrassing to be a Victorian sometimes. Melbourne is actually a nice place despite the pollution and foul weather. But it doesn't take much to sort out the level-headed from the flat-headed . . . or pointy-headed.<br>The latest catalyst was the Bulldogs-Eagles match last Saturday which acted as the last hurrah for the godforsaken Whitten Oval.<br>It is now history that six Bulldogs - we probably should call them mongrels -ganged up on the youngest Eagle, Michael Gardiner, before the bounce.<br>If this act of mass cowardly intimidation was not premeditated, then one can only presume something in the fetid air of the western suburbs got to all six at once.<br>The immediate wash-up was that Eagle Jason Ball was suspended for two matches for striking Paul Dimattina in the mayhem that followed the mugging of Gardiner.<br>Both Ball and Dimattina told the Victorian-based members of the AFL tribunal no punches had landed and the Bulldog staged for a free kick. The tribunal decided to accept the umpire's version and throw Ball out.<br>A week earlier, Nathan Buckley of Collingwood faced a similar charge and the evidence was similar; acting for a free and no contact. What did the tribunal do? Why it accepted the players' versions and Brownlow Medal favourite and adopted Victorian Buckley got off.<br>What really makes the blood boil, however, is the defence by some Vics - and by former Eagle Karl Langdon on Channel 7 on Wednesday - of the mugging of Gardiner.<br>A bit of biff, chesting, eyeballing and verballing are all part of the game - if it is one against one and they are roughly the same size. The fighting of such battles is often crucial in winning the football war.<br>BUT six on one? Gardiner was probably flattered initially. The Bulldogs thought so highly of his obvious talents they just had to unsettle him.<br>Bulldogs president David Smorgon was obviously at a different game. In the Melbourne Age this week he was reported as saying it was a very good, hard, tough game and he called West Coast complaints distasteful. He said the Eagles had a history of verbal abuse and gang tackles. Maybe so but the question was one of cowardly street-fighter mugging, not tough football.<br>On the Internet there is a discussion group dealing with footy only. Bulldogs supporters were notably absent from discussions about the game which were dominated by West Australians upset at gutter tactics.<br>The exception was this Victorian: ?. . . the Bulldogs won. Would you be sooking so much if the West Coast Eagles had won??<br>Responding to a statement that the Gardiner mugging was cowardice, our Melburnian had this to say: ?Ooooh, look Mummy they're bumping into me. Stop them Mummy. Maybe they should've waited until he had the ball then charged him.?<br>With support like this there was no need for any other brilliant observations. A few Victorians joined the fray to say they did not necessarily agree with the Gardiner mugging but it was what the Eagles deserved.<br>They are maddening, people like this. The issue of a young footballer with great talent becoming the subject of gangland terrorism does not seem to be a blot on a great game to them.<br>My one-eyed view is they are afraid that interstate teams have become the pacesetters and their suburban-based competition on horrible little grounds like Whitten Oval is nearly over.<br>Well I've got news for them - the AFL has been a true national competition for years now.<br>And good riddance to the Whitten Ovals over there. Last week's tactics came two days after the emotional unveiling of a statue of late Footscray champion Ted Whitten.<br>I wonder how proud he would have been of his successors.<br></font></p>
