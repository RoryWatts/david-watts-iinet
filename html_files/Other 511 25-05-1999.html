            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO Australian organisations with vastly different aims have updated their Web sites to reflect growing confidence in the medium.<br>The national branch of the Australian Labor Party and the West Coast Eagles football club hit the Web with dramatically redesigned pages.<br>One pushes political ideas and the other Australian football, but both have opted for a slimmer, easier to read and less graphical interface.<br>The ALP took several months to unleash its new look. It operated a special election site during last year's campaign that drew on the latest Web technology, including data base management and Java.<br>After the October election, the party kept its election site but had an under-construction message on the old site.<br>This meant the party's main pages were missing for several months while a complete overhaul was done.<br>The Eagles, on the other hand, stuck with their old look until happy with the redesign and did not miss a day in cyberspace, a move that has delighted Net-savvy supporters who visit the new site in increasing numbers.<br>The ALP was the first major political party in Australia to use the Web. It started a site in July 1995 that featured the party's history, policies, contact details for MPs and a user forum.<br>The forum was used heavily by supporters and opponents alike during the 1996 election and was eventually removed.<br>The other features still exist at the new site, but all respond far more quickly. The latest press releases and transcripts of speeches and interviews have been added and are updated daily.<br>A message at the new site says the party sees the Web as a long-term investment. It used its old site to release policies simultaneously with their release by traditional means during last year's election campaign.<br>Growing experience with the Web and user feedback had led to a redesign that takes away big downloads and cumbersome graphics.<br>The West Coast site has almost mirrored the club's success on the field this year.<br>The Top100 index of most-visited sites recently ranked it the sixth most popular Australian sporting site visited by Australians, and the 13th most popular of all sporting sites. It was also the most popular AFL club site, with Essendon and Hawthorn next.<br>This popularity made it the 87th most visited Australian site in all categories.<br>Peter Taliangis, the club's membership development officer, estimates the site is receiving more than 100,000 visits a day and could be looking at more than 30 million for the year.<br>Seventy per cent of the hits are from within Australia and 10 per cent come from the US.<br>Others have been recorded from Britain, Singapore, New Zealand, Canada, Indonesia and Malaysia.<br>The redesign of the site by the Hotlinks company takes advantage of West Coast's diverse computer database and means the club no longer has to go through the exercise of converting existing data into HTML.<br>?The database structure means all the major parts of the site can be driven by someone who has computer skills, but not necessarily know anything about HTML,? Mr Taliangis said.<br>?Anyone, from the work experience student or the chief executive, can add material to the Web site. That sort of flexibility is fantastic.?<br>He said the site's main objective was to deliver entertainment and information to people interested in the Eagles.<br>A highlight of the redesign is the use of the main page as a virtual newsheet. The club updates its news as many times a day as is warranted.<br>Mr Taliangis said 10 stories were added in one day, emphasising the aim of providing Web users with information they found hard to obtain elsewhere.<br>A Java chat site is taking off and the club's talkback forum, where supporters often engage in lively online discussions, has been streamlined.<br>Mr Taliangis said the club was also providing a free e-mail service twice a week to more than 5000 members and supporters.<br>Other popular areas of the site were the free tipping competitions, photo gallery and player profiles.<br>About 100 orders had been made so far at the new online shopping area.<br>Mr Taliangis said the club was looking at the Web as the perfect place to help with auctions of Eagles memorabilia and merchandise, and membership and ticket sales.<br>HELP DESK<br>ALP: www.alp.org.au<br>Eagles: www.west<br>coasteagles.com.au<br></font></p>
