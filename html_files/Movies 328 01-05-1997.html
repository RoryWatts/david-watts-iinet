            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Donnie Brasco (MA)<br>Al Pacino, Johnny Depp<br>Directed by Mike Newell<br>THE Godfather films have cast a big shadow over mafia movies. It is easy to see this in Al Pacino's latest voyage into gangsterism, Donnie Brasco.<br>At times you can sense front-seat passengers in the hoodlums' cars being nervous to the point of fainting at what the boys in the back are up to. As any lover of The Godfather knows, a good way to get rid of a rival is to make him feel relaxed in the front seat, then garrotte him from the back.<br>Given that Donnie Brasco is set from 1978 on, and is based on a remarkable true story, it is highly likely that the mafia boys portrayed had all seen The Godfather and knew the dangers of car rides with supposed mates.<br>The Godfather's sweeping grandeur has made it a classic of modern cinema. Better, then, to forget all about it and the murderously lovable Corleone family. Donnie Brasco is a film on a different level altogether.<br>It deals with the lowest ranks of the Mob, the foot soldiers, not the dons and their palaces and limousines. It is also laden heavily with truth as it is based on the memoirs of FBI agent Joseph Pistone.<br>From this emerges a grim, realistic film where grotty corner bars and puddle-soaked streets predominate. This is the environment of a down-at-heel loyal mafioso called Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino).<br>He is such a lowly soldier he sometimes resorts to robbing parking meters to fuel his gang's contribution to the higher-flying echelons of the Mob.<br>Into his life walks Donnie Brasco, a young and cocky man who impresses Lefty almost immediately as the type of guy he can teach and gain respect for introducing into the family.<br>But Donnie (a good portrait from Johnny Depp) is really Joseph Pistone, undercover FBI agent with the job of infiltrating the mafia. That is giving nothing away. The secret comes out in the first five minutes.<br>The film devotes some of its energy to showing mafia shenanigans like gunning down rival gangs and sawing up their bodies with hacksaws. But for the most part it concentrates on the growing relationship between Lefty and Donnie.<br>The important struggle of Pistone with changes in his relationships with wife Maggie (Anne Heche) and children are touched on in a superficial manner.<br>If it was simply a shoot-em-up gangster film it would be very drab indeed. The Godfather did this far better as did the cocaine-charged Goodfellas.<br>But the choice of Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell has been a good one. He is able to draw out the Lefty-Donnie relationship into a solid thread, making a quite watchable, if very tense and grim movie.<br>It is a different role for Pacino. We have become accustomed to seeing him in charge in films like The Godfather, Heat, City Hall and Scent of a Woman. Where he has been vulnerable, as in Frankie and Johnny, he has been less of an acting force.<br>But in Donnie Brasco, Pacino is effective as a very vulnerable man. For all his tough talk, Lefty is very low on the food chain. He has a delicate type of cancer, his son is a junkie and he is always broke.<br>He also knows he is going nowhere in the mafia despite having ?clipped 26 guys?. As he admits: ?Even a dog gets to lie in the sun on the pavement.?<br>Depp's Pistone initially sees Lefty as an easy entree to the mafia. And Lefty sees such promise in the new boy that he feels there will be reflected glory for him.<br>But these base, ambitious feelings give way to a genuine affection and deep caring as the two become friends who would literally kill for each other.<br>It is not a homosexual pairing but more a bantering mateship where the affection flows just below the surface.<br>Donnie Brasco begs the question: who will be your typical Italo-American gangster when Pacino is not around? Depp could be, but his range still seems to be romantic rather than brutal.<br></font></p>
