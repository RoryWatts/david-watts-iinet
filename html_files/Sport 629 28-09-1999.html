            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SO who won the battle of the grand finals - the AFL or the NRL?<br>Putting aside all bias towards the free-flowing athleticism of football against the up-and-down-the-field predictability of rugby league, the vote would have to go to the NRL at Stadium Australia on Sunday.<br>The match was watched by a world record rugby league crowd of more than 107,000. The AFL attracted just under 95,000. It has been more than 50 years since league outdrew football on its big day.<br>The Storm's 20-18 win over St George-Illawarra was one of high drama. It got within striking distance courtesy of a pass that looked forward.<br>It tied the score at 18-all three minutes from the end because of that rare beast, the penalty try. There has not been a grand final penalty try for 22 years.<br>Melbourne's triumph can be described as a fairytale, although that word is used advisedly not least because it is applied to the actions of some big, boofy blokes such as Glenn Lazarus.<br>The team has existed for only two seasons and represents an Aussie rules-mad city that before Sunday was only vaguely aware of its existence.<br>Though both channels 7 and 9 appear to have spent the gross national product of a Third World country in bringing the grand finals into our homes, Nine must be judged the winner because its coverage was commercial-free.<br>Where Nine used swags of super slow-motion replays to analyse how tries were scored - or whether they were scored - Seven reserved its heaviest use for Justin Murphy's agonising knee injury.<br>And Seven started its grand final coverage on Friday night with a mostly Victorian look at the AFL competition during the 90s.<br>Called the Decade That Delivered, it glossed over the fact that West Coast dominated football for three or four years by showing highlights only of losses.<br>Indeed it was a total surprise to see the Eagles in three grand finals after the footage appeared to make them such easybeats.<br>Some less sober critics such as Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett have claimed that the Storm's NRL win is further proof that Victoria is truly the home of all football.<br>But the Storm is a franchise team. It has no Victorian players. Five of the squad, including Sunday stars Rodney Howe and Matt Geyer, played for the now-dead Perth Reds.<br>The Storm was born during the Super League fiasco and can thank the News Corporation empire of Rupert Murdoch - which owns 50 per cent of the NRL - for its existence.<br>It is about as Victorian as Alfie Langer and rugby league is about as traditional to Melbourne as bobsledding.<br>Sydney rugby league critic Malcolm Knox put it this way: ?It shows you can go to a place where bugger-all people follow the game ... and throw bagfuls of money at a team, and it doesn't matter that they're not a real club, just part of a company ... and yet they can still win a comp.?<br>I think he barracks for St George.<br></font></p>
