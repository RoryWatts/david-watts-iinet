            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE greatest swimming comeback, maligned Australians dripping gold, silver and bronze at the pool, a killer bomb set by lunatics, spine-tingling rowing medals, two of the most controversial 100m athletics finals in Olympic history - try to digest that with your Weeties.<br>Throw in some excellent cycling medals and a totally unexpected women's javelin silver; not to mention an audacious softball victory over the previously unbeatable Americans and a bronze in that very un-Olympic pursuit of beach volleyball.<br>If Atlanta 96 on TV didn't satisfy the lounge lizards at the weekend, they should give up and snore in front of Neighbours for the duration.<br>As Bruce McAvaney says (quite a lot) you just get the feeling there is more drama to come.<br>The weekend that changed these Games from an anxious, teeth-gnashing interrogation of our swimming performance into a celebration of our overall sporting prowess began with the quiet Queenslander Susie O'Neill.<br>She and Petria Thomas took the 200m butterfly quinella, ending Irish mermaid Michelle Smith's one-woman domination of the pool.<br>Within an hour that happy moment was topped by high emotion as Kieren Perkins proved his greatness with a 1500m gold unequalled for guts.<br>Perkins, ?a real superstar? as Neil Brooks called him, struggling for superlatives, left the opposition in his wake despite being the slowest qualifier 40 seconds off his world record.<br>Almost everyone - except this column - wrote Perkins off. Daniel Kowalski was supposed to win a deserved gold.<br>But no one followed the script. You don't when a champion like Perkins puts his body and soul on the line.<br>The jubilation as he hurdled security barriers to hug his tearful girlfriend was moving stuff with echoes of Pat Cash doing a similar thing when he won Wimbledon in 1987. Cash hugged his coach there.<br>A brave bronze for the men's medley team shortly after kept things on a high.<br>Saturday just wouldn't have been Saturday without the footy despite the drama and excitement of the morning.<br>But as the Bears surged ahead of the Eagles at the Gabba the shocking news of the killer bomb in Atlanta was flashed on the screen.<br>The same news flash was put on the screen during the rugby Test between New Zealand and Australia that followed, catching Channel 7 out.<br>Saturday night with tight security checks and flags at half-mast should have been sombre.<br>BUT it didn't take long for the nerves to tingle as the Oarsome Foursome and the women's pair won heart-stopping golds at Lake Lanier.<br>The silver won by men's pair Weightman and Scott was equally thrilling. They failed by just 0.93sec. to upset British champions Steven Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent.<br>If we'd won we would have denied Britain its first gold of what has been a wretched Games for it.<br>And Redgrave would have been denied his historic fourth gold at successive Olympics which puts him in the distinguished company of American discus thrower Al Oerter, Danish yachtsman Paul Elvstrm and Hungarian fencer Aladar Gerevich.<br>At Stone Mountain it rained and rained, forcing the cycling finals into the wee hours.<br></font></p>
