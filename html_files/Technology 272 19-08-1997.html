            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Speed is not the only way to judge search engines. Reliability and trust in the results returned are at least equally important.<br>One way to check reliability is to fudge the results. I asked seven engines to look for something which I knew already, and a subject whose URL I also knew.<br>This subject was Dr Fred Epstein, a pioneering neurosurgeon in New York.<br>Though not a household name, Dr Epstein is regarded with some reverence in his field where he has broken down barriers and performed life-saving operations to remove tumours from the brainstems of young children.<br>As befits such a man these days, there is a Web page devoted to his activities as the director for neurology and neurosurgery at the Beth Israel Medical Centre.<br>The page - www.bethisraelny.org/inn/<br>epstein.html - was put up in December last year so, should be well within the ken of major engines.<br>Here is what the seven engines returned in response to the simple query ?Dr Fred Epstein?.I left out Australia's Wombat engine because it returns only Australian sites.<br>AltaVista had the page I was looking for at number one.The next nine entries all concerned documents written by Dr Epstein as part of his work at Beth Israel.<br>HotBot had an entry about Dr Epstein at number three in its first 10. It linked to an older site, outlining his work at New York University where he made his reputation.The Beth Israel site I was looking for was listed at number nine.<br>WebCrawler did not find the page I wanted but turned up several sites about work similar to Dr Epstein's, in which he was mentioned.<br>In its first 10 responses, Excite had a Lawrence, a Paul and a Ralph Epstein, but no Fred. They were all doctors, however.<br>Yahoo was similar, fetching sites about Dr Arthur Epstein, a physicist.<br>Infoseek obviously uses different criteria to sort its database. It returned no Epsteins at all among its top 10. However, every response had a Dr Fred.A search using ?Epstein, Dr Fred? was inconclusive.<br>It is hard to figure out exactly what Lycos returned. There were no Epstein sites but there was an awesome amount of biomedical and other research material.<br>On the surface, it looks as if AltaVista, HotBot and perhaps WebCrawler performed best.But experience of the Web's dynamic nature shows that while Lycos, for example, may appear to fail a simple test like this, it will deliver brilliant results in a different field.<br>A lot depends on what you are looking for and how far you are prepared to dig into the tens of thousands of results that can be delivered.<br></font></p>
