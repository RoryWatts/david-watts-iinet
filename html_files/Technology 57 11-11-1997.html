            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Louise Woodward case ruling will appear on the Web at the same time as in the courtroom.<br>The nanny case ruling due this week from the US gives WA Web users the chance to be part of history.<br>Judge Hiller Zobel is going straight to the Web in releasing his decision on defence motions in the case of 19-year-old British au pair Louise Woodward, convicted recently of the murder of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen.The judge will rule on a motion that the verdict be set aside or reduced to manslaughter.<br>The Web has played host to bigger and more important news stories in the past, most notably the death of Princess Diana and the Oklahoma bombing. But it has been a catch-up medium. The news has broken elsewhere and Web sites have trailed TV, although they have usually provided more meaty information than soundbites.<br>The nanny case ruling is the first instance of the Web being used as the means of delivering the news, putting WA's 100,000 or so users in a privileged position.<br>The Lawyers Weekly's site in Massachusetts chosen by Judge Zobel was under siege last week when thousands of people mistook his announcement as a ruling and bombarded the Web page.<br>The site has been hit more than 500,000 times in a week, compared with the average 30,000 a day, causing Web masters to beef up the technology.?Obviously we started working on capacity issues as soon as we heard we were going to get the decision. We have a T1 line which can handle "normal' traffic but knew that this was no ordinary day,? said Erin McCormick, technology vice-president for Lawyers Weekly.<br>?We have sites in place to mirror our site on their servers if needed. You would still type www.lawyersweekly.com to get to the information. We've been up and running all day and expect to be able to handle the traffic from here on in. We've also turned a number of graphics into text to speed up the loading process.<br>?We expect to receive the opinion in the normal channels from our direct link to the court,? Ms McCormick said.<br>?We then basically cut and paste it onto our Web site. So the turnaround should be immediate. It may also come to one of our e-mail addresses which would also allow us to post it immediately.?<br>Massachusetts-based Lawyers Weekly was founded in 1972 and is considered the bible for the legal profession in Massachusetts. Other sites will deliver the ruling almost simultaneously by providing quick links to Lawyers Weekly with their own backgrounders, comment, audio files and graphics.<br>One of the better is The Louise Woodward Case provided by Newton Town Online in suburban Boston. It has full coverage of the original trial, a time-line of events, backgrounds on the people and the issues involved.<br>Also worth a look is Court TV which has a long detailed look at the accusations of baby-shaking and the defence arguments.<br>Help Desk<br>Lawyers Weekly: www.lawyersweekly.com/staff.htm<br>Louise Woodward Case: www.townonline.com/woodward/<br>andwww.townonline.com/newton/news/woodward/html/zobel_ruling.ht<br>Court TV: www.courttv.com/news/report.html<br></font></p>
