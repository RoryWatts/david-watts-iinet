            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 7 was right to stick with the football last Sunday afternoon, despite the passing of the Princess of Wales.<br>Nine showed blanket CNN and Sky coverage while the ABC relayed the BBC's sombre broadcasts, which included the chilling announcement of Diana's death to a goosebumpy backdrop of the Union Jack at half mast while God Save the Queen played.<br>But life goes on even amid great tragedy. And Seven acknowledged it by giving viewers the lift of a thrilling last round.<br>If there is a lesson to be learnt in both sport and life, it is to expect the unexpected and to prepare for as many downs as ups.<br>The sporting roller-coaster had plenty of each at the weekend. Let's examine them:<br>Up - Jeff Farmer's virtuoso performance for wooden spooner Melbourne at the MCG.<br>Down - It was against the Dockers, who should now be allowed to lick their wounds in peace, knowing they are still at least a year away from serious finals contention.<br>Up - The spirited games of Richmond, Essendon and Collingwood. None had anything to play for but pride, and their wins over Carlton, Adelaide and North were great advertisements for the game.<br>Down - The fact that poor, jaded Hawthorn could not join them by knocking off the beastly Western Bulldogs to ensure a final in Perth for West Coast.<br>Up - The stirring early efforts of Port Adelaide against St Kilda as it tried to sneak a finals spot.<br>Down - It was a vain bid and was shown on TV way past most people's bedtime.<br>Up - The record crowd of 46,000 at the SCG on Saturday night.<br>Down - They saw the flaws of their beloved Swans exposed by a very good Geelong side.<br>Up - The strength and skills of West Coast against Brisbane.<br>Down - They were apparent only for a quarter and a half. The Eagles now have to trot their stuff at Football Park in front of more than 40,000 Crows supporters. There is room for only 2000 opposition fans.<br>Up - Brisbane made the eight.<br>Down - Brisbane made the eight.<br>The ups and downs were not restricted to the AFL, of course. For example:<br>Up - The powerful form of Pat Rafter in the US Open tennis championships.<br>Down - The Channel 9 telecasts start at 1am which is basically no one's fault because of the time difference, but a highlights package at a reasonable hour might help.<br>Up - The action-packed highlights of the world cycling championships on SBS.<br>Down - The crash of the Ukrainian pursuit team when it had gold in its grasp.<br></font></p>
