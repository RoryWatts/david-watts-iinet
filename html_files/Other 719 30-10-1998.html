            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT I want to say today is pretty serious. Nevertheless let's have a joke by way of introduction. Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were on a camping trip. They had slipped into their sleeping bags for the night and were looking up at the sky.<br>Holmes said: ?Watson, look up. What do you see??<br>Watson: ?I see thousands of stars.?<br>Holmes: ?And what does that mean to you??<br>Watson: ?It means that of all the planets and suns and moons in the universe, that we are truly the one most blessed with the reason to deduce theorems to make our way in this world of criminal enterprises and blind greed. It means that we are truly small in the eyes of God but struggle each day to be worthy of the senses and spirit we have been blessed with.?<br>Holmes: ?To me, it means someone has stolen our tent.?<br>The moral of the joke was more succinctly put by Joni Mitchell in her song Big Yellow Taxi: ?Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got "till it's gone.?<br>What seems to have gone from modern society is maturity.<br>Take a look at some of the blockbuster news stories of the past week or so.Liberal ministers Tony Abbott and Peter Costello and their wives sue publishers Random House for defamation over a passage in Bob Ellis's book, Goodbye Jerusalem, that claims the ministers had pre-marital sex with a woman whom one of them married. The claim is untrue, it transpires.<br>To add more rubbish to the heap, former governor-general Bill Hayden repeats sexual rumours about former prime minister Paul Keating ?as an example? of the harm such unfounded gossip can do.Sunday newspapers of the Rupert Murdoch variety go into drooling overtime about James Packer's new companion Jodi Meares - a delightfully curvaceous young woman pictured in a brief bikini with the hulking heir to Channel 9 and a lack of tax problems.<br>A report in the Sydney Sunday Telegraph follows the couple every step of the way down the main street of Noosa, remarking when they cuddle, hold hands or speak.In England, the republican cause is further strengthened by claims from Penny Junor, alleged friend of Prince Charles, that the infamous Charles-Di break-up was the fault of the late princess.<br>Ms Junor, whose son goes to Eton with Prince Harry, is said to have received more than $1 million for the book in which the claims are made.<br>No one can possibly divine the truth of her allegations because the main protagonists of them - Diana and an officer with whom she is said to have had an affair - are both dead.<br>All this without touching on US President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the sex scandal that has defined 1998 as a year of utter childishness.<br>For aren't all the above just merely grown-up versions of children's tittle-tattle, or dobbing? Don't they remind you of the schoolyard and groups of 10 and 11-year-olds with snotty noses and still-to-be-formed minds?<br>Taking a few examples, the Clinton and Lewinsky case from the schoolyard point of view would go like this:<br>Ooh-aah, we saw her rubbing up against Bill behind the toilets.<br>To which Bill could say - just like that naughty boy Paul. Got ya, I dobbed ya, you're in for it now.<br>The Packer case - Jamie's got a girlfriend, Jamie's got a girlfriend, nyah naah nah nah na.<br>The Penny dreadful affair - I know something you don't know. Wanna know a secret? Di was bad, but you'll just have to take my word for it.<br>How I wish we'd all grow up.<br></font></p>
