            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Popcorn<br>By Ben Elton<br>Simon & Schuster, $24.95<br>THE other night, instead of my usual sweet dreams about wrestling the Gladiatrix Storm, I tossed and turned in anxiety. It was Ben Elton's fault.<br>The English comedian has always had a dark and cutting edge to his humour. Nowhere is that more evident than in his latest book, Popcorn, which ultimately goes to the core question in modern society - are we responsible for our actions?<br>The nightmare-making parts of Popcorn are fairly frequent for a work of light fiction, enough to make it dark, bordering on black humour. It is too serious to be hilarious, and too funny to be grave.<br>Elton has set his work in Los Angeles, a city of which he appears to have a very jaundiced view.<br>Even at his darkest and most cutting in his first novel, Stark, Elton still heaped a few dollops of goodwill on his mainly Australian characters.<br>Similarly in Gridlock, his fellow Englishmen got some sympathy. But here we have Bruce Delamitri, coolest of the cool in Hollywood, on the day and night of his supreme triumph at the Oscars where he wins the best director award.<br>Within hours he comes face to face with two white-trash mass murderers, who, the argument goes, are rabid creatures invented by Delamitri himself.<br>Bruce is no maker of light romantic comedies. Murder, mayhem, sick humour and all to a thumping rock beat are his imprints on the film scene.<br>Oliver Stone or Quentin Tarantino in thin disguise? It could be either or both. Elton describes Bruce's films in a way which conjures up Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction by Tarantino.<br>But the psychopathic pair - Wayne and his girlfriend Scout - who get their kicks killing masses of totally innocent shoppers in malls and fast-food shops, are straight out of Stone's Natural Born Killers.<br>It doesn't particularly matter which one is thinly disguised as Bruce. What is more thinly disguised is Elton's contempt for this sort of film which shows a truly rotten side of life.<br>Wayne and Scout allegedly are the victims of that rotten side - little schooling, abused childhoods, a life of junk food and talk-back TV, and most importantly a heavy diet of Bruce's gory films.<br>It is the sort of lifestyle that makes them senseless slaughterers, caring little for the consequences. Or is it the fault of their lifestyle?<br>Bruce spends a fair part of Popcorn trying to argue that his films reflect rather than influence life. About half the American population says Bruce is innocent; the other half that he is as guilty as hell and his work should be banned.<br>He is the type of hip Hollywood intellectual with attitude who would appear to be a hero to Wayne and Scout.<br>But is he? Elton throws them together after Oscar night when the murderous duo break into Bruce's mansion - Wayne has a plan for salvation - spoiling Bruce's strangely inept seduction of a Playboy centrefold.<br>This is where some nightmares begin. Wayne and Scout dispose of Bruce's security guard with ease and to prove it Wayne plucks his severed head from a bag and impales it on a lamp in front of Bruce and his Playboy bunny.<br>Within pages Wayne has shot dead Bruce's visiting agent, maimed the model and taken Bruce's soon-to-be ex-wife and precocious daughter hostage ... all live on network and cable TV.<br>Stunned but delighted Americans watch the showdown and it is their response to Wayne's ever-increasing demands for publicity that provide Popcorn's biggest impact and lasting memories ... as well as fundamental questions concerning the type of people we all are.<br>Popcorn takes a little getting used to because of Elton's confronting story. But his ease with language and the one-liner, kick-in-the-guts humour he deploys like a missile are treats that make this book hard to put down ... and worth thinking about.<br></font></p>
