            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU want to watch Test cricket on TV? Easy, just click on Nine. But wait, that's the Shopping Channel from some unknown pay-TV operator isn't it?<br>Sometimes Nine's Test telecasts - and certainly its one-day coverage - are just like a visit to the shopping centre.<br>Richie Benaud, Tony Greig and Ian Chappell are most often the salesmen. Bill Lawry would get too excited perhaps.<br>They flog photographic prints - big ones - of great moments in sport.<br>The average price is $150 which Benaud always assures us is great value.<br>According to Nine's sports site on the Internet - and the boys have been flogging that of late, too - the must-have photo goodies are the work of the Loughman brothers, who after three years of development, have perfected their ?revolutionary technique of wide-angle/zoom photography?.<br>Greig is the salesman in cyberspace. He explains: ?Each print comes with a title plaque and framing information which I am sure you will find enhances the presentation of your valuable print.?<br>He says the prints are expected to increase in value over time.<br>Indeed, at auction one called The Tackle went for $2600. Or maybe it was $26,000. The authors of the Sports Shop, where Greig spruiks, have written $2,6000.00.<br>All this has very little to do with Test cricket, of course. For some reason, Nine, is not content with a commercial after each over -- and that can be one every three minutes with spinners on both ends.<br>Nor is it content with running nagging little messages across the bottom of the screen when it is back at the game.<br>Although all that sounds like more than enough sponsorship, the viewer is then buttonholed by Benaud and Co to come up and view the network's etchings, as it were.<br>We have all had an eyeful of the Victory Dance, four shots showing Australia winning the Ashes earlier this year. Now, we are being seduced by Cathy Freeman winning the 400m world title at Athens, a long shot of Tiger Woods at the US Open, and Greg Norman plugging away at the Australian Open.<br>It is to Nine's credit that we actually get to see a fair bit of cricket as well.<br>Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting saving Australia, Shane Warne scaring the wide-eyed Darryl Cullinan so he is run out, Gary Kirsten's disbelief at being given caught behind for 83, Dave Richardson pausing to check his lbw on the big screen, Mark Waugh being an absolute duffer in the crazy opening to Australia's second innings ... it was all there with an ample supply of slow-motion replays and the accompaniment of Greig-Lawry bickering. And it has been absorbing and tense.<br>One senses these South Africans are about as fun-loving as Kepler Wessells. Yet this is what Test cricket is all about.<br>If Nine can show that as well as they do, defining the fine line between tedium and absorption, why bother to treat the viewing public like a bunch of shoppers looking for a fix after the Christmas sales?<br>Save it for the pigeons at square leg.<br></font></p>
