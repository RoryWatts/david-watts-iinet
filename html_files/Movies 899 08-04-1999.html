            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE MATRIX<br>Keanu Reeves is a computer expert recruited by the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a terrorist and cult leader who exists 2000 years in the future. Reeves is told that he is The One, the saviour who is the only hope in the battle against malevolent technological forces aligned against mankind in 1999. The Matrix was filmed in Sydney and written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, best-known for their controversial lesbian thriller Bound. Rated M (Not reviewed).<br>A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES<br>Boaz Yakin's follow-up to the acclaimed Fresh is set in a community of Orthodox Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and concerns the daughter of gemologist (Renee Zellweger) who is trapped in an unhappy marriage to a devout scholar (Glenn Fitzgerald). Her escape comes in the shape of the scholar's older brother (Christopher Eccleston), a diamond merchant who offers her both romance and a place in the business. But her freedom has a terrible price. Revue Cinemas in Dalkeith. Rated M (Not reviewed).<br>THE RUGRATS MOVIE H H H<br>CHILDREN will love the way the popular Rugrats has grown from the TV screen to 90 minutes of wild adventure. Chucky, Tommy, Phil and Lill and to a lesser extent, Angelica, are propelled into the woods after failing to exchange Tommy's new little brother, Dil, at the ?baby store? (the hospital). Wolves, storms and a group of escaped circus monkeys lie between the Rugrats and home. The expansion to the big screen adds colour, better graphics and wilder stories, but does take away from some of the characterisation and witty dialogue that has made the TV show so popular with all age groups. Rated G (David Watts)<br>VARSITY BLUES H H<br>ALL the stereotypes and cliches about small-town America and heroism are here. Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek plays understudy to the high school football team's star quarterback. He is thrust into the limelight when the star is injured. Not only does he lock horns with the dictatorial coach Kilmer (Jon Voight as reptilian as ever), but he has to fight off the chief cheerleader in a whipped cream bikini. It is almost futile to condemn Varsity Blues because teen audiences seem to thrive on this celluloid version of junk food. Rated M (David Watts)<br>SHE'S ALL THAT H H H ½<br>On the face of it, She's All That looks like just another teen romance where the rich/cool boy falls for the poor/dorky girl. But this one is peppered with delightful characters, savvy dialogue and such savage put-downs I'd be scared to set foot in this California high school. Its story involves an unlikely friendship that blooms into romance when cool Zack takes a wager that he can win over Laney, who is more turned on by art than boys. There is enough spunk in the scenes to lift She's All That above the deluge of teen films. Rated M (Sue Yeap).<br>CENTRAL STATION H H H H<br>There's nothing original in the premise of a cranky, selfish older woman becoming the protector of a child after the death of his parents. However, what matters is not the particular journey director Walter Salles takes us on in this Brazilian variant of the American road movie, which is fairly predictable, but the graceful, tender yet thoroughly unsentimental way he develops the fractious relationship between odd couple Dora and little Josue. What elevates the film is the beautifully modulated performance of veteran stage actress Fernanda Montenegro, who deservedly was nominated for a best actress Oscar. Rated M. (Mark Naglazas).<br>CRUEL INTENTIONS H H H ½<br>First-time writer-director Roger Kumble strains a little in resetting Liaisons Dangereuses among privileged teens in Manhattan's Upper East Side; reputation does not quite have the same impact as it did back in 1782 and the writing of letters seems almost anachronistic in this era of mobile phones and e-mail. However, Kumble has created some very credible equivalents of the sexy seducers Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil in the spoiled preppy brats played with zing by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe, with enough witty barbs to lift it above the level of the average teen-oriented pic. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>HILARY AND JACKIE H H H<br>While many have complained that this bio-pic of Jacqueline du Pre is an outrageous falsification, especially a scene in which du Pre sleeps with her sister's husband, the real problem with it is that the sensational stuff is largely irrelevant. It's just thrown in, like a naughty anecdote told among the chattering classes. There is very little in this stylish, swift-moving but frustratingly elliptical film that provides insight into either the genius or the emotional problems of the great British cellist. Worth seeing for the fine performances of Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths as Jacqueline and her less talented younger sister Hilary. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE H H ½<br>Kevin Costner is just too perfect playing a boat-builder grieving for his dead wife. He's only ever loved one other woman in his life, chooses his few words carefully, has poetry in his soul, is great with children and older folk and always immaculately dressed. So much time is spent capturing the tasteful country living magazine-type details that this air-brushed romance between Costner's Garret Blake and Robin Wright Penn's Theresa never achieves the passion that justifies its final-reel spill into tragedy. Paul Newman as Garret's old-coot father adds some body to this very watery soup. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>ANALYZE THIS H H H ½<br>Robert de Niro, a Mafia boss who goes into therapy with understandably nervous Dr Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) after an anxiety attack, breaks down and bawls his eyes out so many times you're afraid his gun will rust. The skill with which de Niro shuffles between neurotic New Yorker and scary mobster is what helps sustain this one-joke movie from Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day), providing plenty of laughs without ever descending into Naked Gun-style parody. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>HAPPINESS H H H H ½<br>Audiences are going to be shocked and confused by Happiness, with every character in this black comedy suffering some form of contemporary dysfunction. However, you need look no farther than the deeply ironic title to discover the meaning of this brilliantly made, envelope-pushing film and, most importantly, the justification for showing the things that scared off its original American distributor. In pursuing perfect happiness so relentlessly, these sad, self-loathing New Jersey suburbanites fail to notice the few scraps of joy that life tosses at their feet. A disturbing and dangerous film but well worth the risk. At the Luna. Rated R (Mark Naglazas)<br>PAPERBACK HERO H H H ½ Hugh Jackman and Claudia Karvan conjure up the stuff of appealing romantic comedy in this tale of a romance-writing truck driver too embarrassed to use his real name when he sends his work to the publisher. Instead Jackman's blokey Jack borrows the name of Ruby (Karvan), the tomboyish girlfriend of his best mate, Hamish, for his little subterfuge. Ruby hears of the masquerade when a publicist (Angie Milliken) drops in to sign the supposed writer for a promotional tour. Engaging performances from a strong cast. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST MATTHEW.<br>(Cinema Paradiso at 1.50pm on Saturday). Italian director Pier Paulo Pasolini created a powerful yet controversial view of the gospel story in his 1964 film using non-professional actors . Its cine-verite, quasi-documentary style was a far cry from the sentimental depictions of Christ by Hollywood and was coloured by his Marxist sentiments at the time. Rated M. (The film is part of the Cinemateque season at Paradiso. Cheapest way to see it is to buy a four-film season pass for $20, which allows another three classic films until November. An eight-film pass is even better value at $30. Cinematheque runs every Saturday afternoon.)<br></font></p>
