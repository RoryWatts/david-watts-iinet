            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE NSW Government's proposed Internet censorship laws have so outraged the ACT PC Users' Group that it has started an online petition calling for sense in cyberspace regulation.<br>The NSW plans, attacked by Net users as ignorant and draconian, will be put to the State Attorneys-General conference on Thursday as a possible platform for uniform national legislation.<br>The ACT attack on the plans is the latest outburst of user anger since NSW Attorney-General Jeff Shaw announced tough plans in April to fine and jail users viewing or transmitting material unfit for 15-year-olds and younger.<br>Critics say this would prohibit sensible and educational use of the Net. Mr Shaw says he wants to crack down on paedophilia.<br>The ACT PC Users' Group petition is addressed to the ACT Government, but those who sign it can also ask it to be forwarded to the NSW and Federal governments.<br>The petition says users are concerned regulatory moves planned against the Net are ?being taken in ignorance and fear, not in response to practical or researched need?. Policy was being formulated by officials ignorant of the nature of the Internet and without proper consultation with users.<br>?We are concerned because policies now being proposed do not adequately protect our freedom of speech, our freedom of assembly or our privacy,? the petition says. ?We are concerned because these policies endanger the safety and liberty of Australian citizens, diminish Australia's industrial competitiveness, harm the education of Australian children and lower Australia in the esteem of other nations.?<br>URL for ACT petition:<br>www.pcug.org.au/%7Ekauer/petition.html<br>NSW discussion: aus.org.efa and aus.org.waia<br></font></p>
