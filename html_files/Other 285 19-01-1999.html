            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TELEVISION has turned sport into a vast arena of great expectations.<br>Not that the field of human combat was not already under such strain.<br>My grandfather used to tell me the streets of Brisbane would empty when the wireless breathlessly announced Bradman had gone in to bat. The expectation was that the master would make a century and entertain the populace.<br>The outcome was that he nearly always did. But wool was on its way to being worth a pound a pound and you could leave your back door unlocked, too.<br>Now, TV, with a combination of slow motion, tilted camera angles and music, is trying to turn sport into something bigger than and different to the huge distraction it always has been.<br>Look no further than Channel 7's coverage of the first day of the Australian Open yesterday.<br>The relentless home crowd pressure is on Pat Rafter or Mark Philippoussis to be there at the end. To a lesser extent, a lot is also expected of Lleyton Hewitt and Jelena Dokic.<br>Seven - in pursuit of sport as another blockbuster program - intensified the pressure with a segment showing Philippoussis playing at super slow motion (to accentuate his power no doubt) and to the accompaniment of Frank Sinatra's Let Me Try Again.<br>If one viewing was not stomach-churning enough, Seven put it on again at the end of its daytime coverage to highlight the main game of the night.<br>This daytime cover featured our great hope, Rafter, winning handsomely against German Oliver Gross after the usual early hiccups.<br>It also featured a tiny segment of Rafter smashing away to the accompaniment of grand classical music.<br>Does the difference in soundtracks make Rafter the classic hero and Philippoussis the sentimental favourite?<br>Will Hewitt be given a few verses of Blond Headed Stompy-Wompy Real Gone Surfer Boy?<br>And young Dokic treated to some lines of William Blake - tiger, tiger burning bright?<br>Tennis on TV seems less and less to be about the game. More and more a parade of healthy, young personalities who the public see as celebrities.<br>One Seven interview with spectators yesterday featured a bloke in a cocktail dress, camping it up that he had come only to see former champion Mary Pierce, now better known for her dramatic on-court antics than her hard-hitting game.<br>Why else would Russian super-brat Anna Kournikova be such a crowd puller? The 17-year-old barely wins a match, but she looks good in a tight tennis outfit.<br></font></p>
