            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN LONDON, the Sunday Express newspaper makes annual Dubious Achievement Awards for those who drop stitches while weaving life's rich tapestry. Among their awards this year were these gems:<br>? Mr John Bloor, who mistook a tube of Superglue for his haemorrhoid cream and glued his buttocks together.<br>? Percy the pigeon, who flopped down exhausted in a Sheffield loft, having beaten 1000 rivals in an 800km race ... and was immediately eaten by a cat.<br>? Poacher Marino Malerba, who shot a stag standing above him on an overhanging rock - and was killed instantly when it fell on him.<br>It is a pity we in Australia do not have the same sort of awards. There would be many contenders to bring a smile to our faces, though not all the dubious achievements mentioned above are funny, of course.<br>Glued together buttocks- especially with painful haemorrhoids - are no laughing matter. Nor are gulped-down pigeons or men dying under falling stags.<br>And my main contender for a dubious achiever award is no joke either. Step forward, after you've used frequent flyer points to get here, Malcolm Arthur Colston, independent senator representing the State of Queensland.<br>What brings Senator Colston immediately to mind is not his well-fed size nor his well-proved ability to collect gongs. He already has a BA, BEd (Hons) and a PhD. The former teacher, research officer and psychological consultant has been adorned with the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal (1978), National Medal (1979) and Reserve Force Medal (1985).<br>According to biographical details at the National Library in Canberra, he has also kept the rank of major earned during his days in the Army Reserve.<br>No, none of that, even though it all sounds exemplary. What brought the blurred image of the big Southport (Gold Coast) pollie into sharp focus was a poignant letter to the editor from Amanda O'Brien, of North Perth, published in The West Australian on Wednesday.<br>T HE letter contrasted the lives of Senator Colston and an unnamed disabled friend of the writer's. The wheelchair-bound friend, living on $175 a week, pays for food, taxis, medication and all household items.<br>Like the big senator, the friend is on committees. But unlike Senator Colston, the disabled friend gives his time voluntarily in work for others and pays the cost of getting to and from meetings.<br>On the other hand, we all pay Senator Colston's handsome salary and superannuation benefits which will amount to about $1 million when he finally deigns to leave Parliament.<br>But what does the senator want? During his more than 20 years of supping at the public trough, the senator, it has been found, has claimed improperly thousands of dollars worth of travel allowance.<br>He recently put these ?oversights? down to sloppy bookkeeping. And the staff member accused of the bad work got a pay rise.<br>Prime Minister John Howard needs Senator Colston's ?independent? vote to ensure his Government's legislation gets through what otherwise would be a deadlocked Senate.<br>For example, last week he sided with the Government in outlawing the Northern Territory's euthanasia laws.<br>To cap it off, Senator Colston, who quit the Labor Party last year, has been wearing the hat of Deputy President of the Senate - a very high office indeed. And this week he has actually been the acting President of the Senate.<br>He really does set a fine example of good government. Make a few sloppy mistakes, even claim you were in two cities at the same time so you can get a travel allowance, quit your party allegiances ... and end up in the big chair with a grand title.<br>What hope do normal Australians have of trying to impress on the young, especially, the basic tenets of honesty and hard work?<br>Former prime minister Paul Keating once described the Senate as ?unrepresentative swill?. Performances like those of Senator Colston give some weight to this harsh statement.<br></font></p>
