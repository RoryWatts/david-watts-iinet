            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THANK Logie Baird, or whoever the deity of television is, for highlights. Channel 7's prime-time overview of day two managed to give our first gold medallist his proper day in the sun.<br>The unfortunate thing about Michael Diamond's historic trap shooting gold was that it happened while the bulk of the population slept. And it also happened in a not very tele-visual sport.<br>For a while, it looked like repeated replays of Daniel Kowalski's 200m freestyle bronze were going to overshadow Diamond's terrific moment.<br>Here was a man, unheralded in pre-Games hype, shooting a near-perfect score and putting Australia up with the big ones nice and early.<br>But last night Seven had the whole works - tearful medallist, happy family and even a small pro-gun statement to make up for what to most viewers earlier in the day would have been seen as a concentration on swimming, cycling, basketball, hockey and rowing.<br>And at the pool and the rainswept cycle road race, our hyped athletes swam and rode into dry territory.<br>Samantha Riley was no match for the South African 100m breaststroke powerhouse Penelope Heyns, who monstered the event with a world record, just as Fred from Belgium did the day before in the men's version.<br>The fact that Heyns almost sounded like an Aussie when Neil Brooks interviewed her in a poolside coup was some small comfort.<br>And how like a fearless young champion she was when she told Brooks: ?I'm still getting the feel for the race.?<br>It was wet on the leafy cycling road race circuit, but we Aussie viewers were left thirsting for a sight of defending champion Kathy Watt.<br>Channel 7 crossed to the early stages of the race about 11.25pm on Sunday, replaying a spectacular crash which Drew Morphett described as ?a bit of a bingle?, much to the chagrin of fellow commentator and cycling champion Phil Anderson.<br>?It's clear you don't ride bikes, mate,? Anderson told the chirpy footy commentator.<br>We had a sighting of Watt then, but two hours later, when the final laps started to unravel, she was nowhere to be seen. She finished ninth.<br>ANNA Wilson (17th) was up with the leaders early but in the later cross she disappeared, too. The only footage of Tracey Watson (39th) was her unfortunate crash, one of many by competitors in the slippery conditions.<br>The trouble with television is it is an unreliable form guide. Our rowers were magnificent in the Lake Lanier heats. The cameras hugged them and their superbly fit bodies from all angles as they powered to four heat wins in six events.<br>But we are none the wiser about the other teams because we were shown only Australian heats. It is still unknown whether we will blitz the opposition when it comes to the crunch.<br>On air this morning - Swimming: women's 400m freestyle; men's 100m freestyle; women's 100m backstroke; men's 200m butterfly. Tonight - Men's basketball v Yugoslavia. Swimming includes men's 400m freestyle heats and women's 200m breaststroke.<br></font></p>
