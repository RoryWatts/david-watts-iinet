            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It is easy to take new technology for granted. Sometimes it does the soul good to sit back and reflect on how helpful computers and the Internet are.<br>Last week I found myself hammering the keyboard and haranguing the PC for its occasional go-slow tactics.<br>But instead of continuing this heart-attack approach to computing, I decided to take time out and think what I'd been able to achieve.<br>The mind automatically switched to a personal passion. But I dare not write about the Samantha Fox Web Ring in a family newspaper, so I switched to another passion: footy.<br>Every weekend I am able to go to the AFL page and click on non-televised games which I can virtually watch because the scores are updated every 20 seconds. So are the stats.<br>And if the AFL Net connection is becoming congested, I switch to the Age Footy 98 page where I can be similarly entertained, not only by scores and stats, but by e-mail barracking from around the world.<br>Michael Voss, a footballer I admire, broke his leg in the Fremantle-Brisbane match on a Sunday. And the next day I was able to go to the Brisbane Lions site which gave me an update on his condition and allowed me to send him a get well e-mail, to which the club responded the next day (unlike Prime Minister John Howard who has yet to reply to an e-mail I sent him on election eve in 1996).<br>A friend in Spain was in e-mail contact last Wednesday with all the latest news about her recent marriage and new job. I was able to fire off a quick reply and apologise for forgetting her birthday the week before.<br>As a brain tumour sufferer I was able to ?talk? to a farmer in the US who suffers the same complaint and ask him about a new herbal remedy he was trying.<br>On Thursday I was beguiled by one of the best Web sites I have seen; a virtual tour of the Chateau of Versailles outside Paris (see WebSights, page 6).<br>And that night I was able to direct my daughter through several searches for information on great flood disasters for a project she is doing at high school.<br>Those are only a few of the goodies the week in front of a PC brought.<br>Thousands of other Australians - if they took the time to reflect - would have noted similar benefits.<br>The number of people experiencing the help of computers and the Net is growing rapidly. A report in The West Australian last Friday quoted an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey as showing home computer use had jumped 23 per cent to 2.4 million in the two years to February 1998.<br>If figures like that continue, there is bound to be much more satisfaction at the ability to communicate, entertain and work in the home.<br>There will also be a great need for guidance. We who use them daily know that computers can be a pain. In fact it sometimes feels like little green men running around inside make them work . . . or not, as the case may be.<br>The Access liftout has tried to be a focal point for such guidance for 12 months now. Unfortunately uncertain economic times mean that sections like this have to pay their way.<br>Although liked by readers, Access is not a focus for advertisers and thus will not appear in this form after today.<br>The West Australian will now publish an enlarged computer section in the Business pages on Tuesdays and readers who have sought our advice will have the same access and response.<br>It has been a worthwhile year for all of us here, but life must go on, albeit in a slightly different way.<br>Never take anything for granted, however. With figures like those from the ABS, who knows what the future will bring?<br>HELP DESK<br>AFL page:www.afl.com.au<br>Age Footy 98: www.theage.com.au/footy98.index.html<br>Brisbane Lions: www.lions.com.au<br>Australian Bureau of Statistics:www.statistics.gov.au<br></font></p>
