            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EVERY senator has been sent a copy of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four in a protest against Internet censorship legislation due to come before the chamber this week.<br>Como Internet service provider and protest organiser Mark Reynolds said yesterday the book was an obvious symbol for opposition to the Online Services Bill which he called a totally unwarranted extension of Government powers.<br>?People from across Australia and around the world have contributed towards this project,? Mr Reynolds said. ?I hope it will make all senators stop and think about the importance of the issues they are dealing with.?<br>The protest, known as Project 1984, is the latest move by Net users to highlight their anger about a censorship regime which they claim will not work, will slow the Net, and make it more expensive. Nearly 13,000 Net users signed an online petition against the Bill and more than 100 submissions to a Senate committee examining it damned moves to rate Net content on the same basis as television and films.<br>Mr Reynolds said he had sent a fax to all 76 senators saying that the censorship Bill put Australia in the same league as repressive regimes in China and Saudi Arabia.<br>?The Internet is not pay television ... It should not be subject to classification and censorship any more than conversations, letters, faxes or telephone calls,? Mr Reynolds' faxes said.<br>Communications Minister Richard Alston has repeatedly claimed the Bill is designed to protect Australian children from paedophiles, bomb makers, drug pushers and racists ?pushing their poison on the Net?.<br>He has also repeatedly dismissed claims from critics in the Net industry that the legislation was introduced to try to win the vote of Tasmanian Independent Brian Harradine, a strong morals crusader and outspoken critic of Net content.<br>Senator Harradine, who has described the legislation as too weak, said yesterday he would still support it.<br>He rejected claims that the legislation had been introduced to win his support for the GST.<br>He emphasised he was not happy with the Bill, but congratulated the Government on making a start on addressing the problems of pornography, violence, hate sites and bomb recipes.<br>Online critics of the Bill have said there is no evidence that people want the Government to regulate Net content, particularly as material that is legal in other media would become illegal online.<br>A protest march against the legislation will be held in Perth on Friday.<br></font></p>
