            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT are AFL fans going to do on September 27?<br>That is grand final day, of course, but it feels like there has been a grand final a week in the first five frenetic rounds already.<br>No one is unbeaten and no one has failed to win. TV viewers have certainly had their fill of emotional, close contests, too.<br>It began with the first match of the year, Melbourne's shock victory over premier North Melbourne. The big grins and backslapping among Neil Balme and crew seemed Septemberish.<br>Since then, three wins in a row to newcomer Port Adelaide have all been attended by high emotion and grand final-like scenes.<br>It doesn't hurt to have three straight matches at home. But the professionalism Port showed to knock off early-season favourite Brisbane on Sunday indicates the team is a genuine AFL competitor.<br>In Melbourne, Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett has taken another step in stealing the best from other States.<br>Remember how he pirated the Australian Grand Prix from Adelaide? Now, Mr Kennett has stolen Perth's weather.<br>What other explanation is there for the weekly contests at the MCG being bathed in glorious sunshine?<br>The Anzac Day contest between Essendon and Collingwood was a sell-out, allowing Victorians the rare pleasure of a live TV match from their own headquarters.<br>The Footy Show's Eddie Maguire called it ?the biggest sell-out ever?, which is hard to explain given there are a finite number of seats to sell out. Presumably a sell-out should always mean the same number of tickets sold.<br>The Anzac Day match with its bumper crowd of 83,000 proved not to be as big a sell-out as two years ago when the sell-out was 90,000, or last year, when it was more than 85,000.<br>Viewers saw how upset Collingwood's Robbie Ahmat was after a verbal joust with Bomber Michael Prior. The big question in what has become a very sticky situation is whether the adjective Prior used to describe Ahmat was ?dark? or ?dumb?.<br>All the football talkfests on TV have tried to make sense of the racist sledging debate.<br>Few have turned up anything new, mostly because these shows are hosted by and stacked with old players who tend to see situations through their own playing experiences in a less racially tolerant and more robust time.<br>It was refreshing to see Kevin Bartlett on Seven's Footy Panel on Sunday trying to put the argument in an up-to-date context, admitting modern pressures like political correctness.<br>Bartlett missed the chance to find humour in the colour situation on the field when calling the Fremantle-St Kilda match on Friday night .<br>After all, the Dockers with Black and White were too good for the Saints with Brown and Gray. KB persisted in linking up St Kilda's young firm of Brown, Smith and Jones.<br>And have you noticed that Bartlett's most common criticism is ?that's a poor pass?? He didn't earn his ?Hungry? nickname at Richmond because of his brilliant passing.<br></font></p>
