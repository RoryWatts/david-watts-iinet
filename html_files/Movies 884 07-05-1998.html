            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">New release<br>A THOUSAND ACRES<br>Described as ?King Lear in the cornfields?, this adaptation of Jane Smiley's novel is about a cranky old farmer (Jason Robards) who, for tax purposes, divides up his kingdom among his daughters. When the youngest (Jennifer Jason Leigh) discovers she has been cut out of her share of the inheritance she goes to war with her elder siblings (Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer), dividing the family and unearthing dark, devastating secrets. Directed by Australian Jocelyn Moorhouse (Proof, How To Make An American Quilt), the film looks pretty and the performances are heartfelt but Smiley's novel has been insufficiently dramatised, with the story leaping from one overwrought melodramatic moment to the next. Full review, Today page 5 Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>DEEP RISING<br>Those sick of the Titanic phenomenon might want to set sail with Deep Rising, a sci-fi action movie about a giant squid that attacks a cruise ship in the South China Sea and gobbles up all on board. When the bad guys board the ship with every intention of hijacking it on its maiden voyage, they find the remains of 1000 dead passengers looking like, according to one US critic, ?a big vat of uncooked Southern barbecue. There are a couple of survivors, the evil owner of the ship who, in the tradition of such movies, didn't heed warnings about the power of nature, and a beautiful jewel thief played by Famke Janssen who was locked inside the brig at the time of the attack. None of which matters, of course, because all fans of this kind of B-grade schlock really want to see is the giant squid, which apparently has ?a vast evil head with lots of tentacles and lots of mouths with many teeth?. Rated MA (Not Previewed)<br>SWEPT FROM THE SEA<br>At last a movie based on the work of a classic author other than Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy or Henry James. A close adaptation of Joseph Conrad's short story Amy Foster, Swept From the Sea is about a doomed love affair between a simple country girl and a Ukrainian peasant who is swept on to the Cornish shore in 1888 after his emigrant ship sinks on its way to America. The Ukrainian, who speaks no English and whose hair, beard and ragged clothes make him look like a wild man, strikes fear into the hearts of the locals - all except Amy Foster (Rachel Weisz), a girl born in scandalous circumstances. Amy and Yanko (Vincent Perez) court, fall in love, are married and have a child. Unfortunately, the hunky Yank also attracts the attention of the local doctor (Ian McKellan) who grows jealous and resentful of Amy. This Beeban Kidron-directed period drama, spiced up with the hint of homosexuality, has swept into town with mixed reports, from ?plodding? to ?deeply poignant?. Rated M (Not Previewed)<br>THE BOYS<br>Those despairing that Australian film is about to enter one of its cyclical barren periods (Diana and Me, A Little Bit of Soul) will have their spirits lifted by The Boys, a gritty crime drama in which the tension is cranked up to an almost unbearable level. Based on the celebrated 1991 play by Gordon Graham, which was itself based on the ghastly rape and murder of nurse Anita Coby, The Boys moves between two time periods - the day in which Brett Sprague (David Wenham) returns to his family home after a 12-month stint in jail and, in a series of largely silent flash forwards, the aftermath of what we presume to be a dreadful crime. Those dark events, however, are not the focus of this powerful, flawlessly acted drama. Rather, it is the exploration of the relationship of three brothers whose inability to deal with women leads to frustration, despair and violence. This official entry at the Berlin Festival, adapted by playwright Steven Sewell and directed by newcomer Rowan Woods, may prove to be the film of this Australian cinema year. At the Luna. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE<br>Bill Murray, as an American dork named Wallace Ritchie visiting his suave banker brother in England, plays the man who knows too little. But the actor and director, Jon Amiel, know just enough to keep the laughs coming. What's better than a pain-in-the-ass relative turning up to stay? Turning him out of doors immediately, to spend his birthday in a ?Theatre of Life? in which a group of actors includes a ?real-life? extra in their dramatics. What could be funnier than that? Have Wallace stumble off the streets and into an ?even-more-real? drama in which Russians and Cold-Warmongering Brits are conspiring to blow up a peace ceremony. Murray, even before he puts on a Cossack suit and dances like a sack of Siberian potatoes, is just right as the bumbling sibling. Every family should have one. Peter Gallagher (James Ritchie), Joanne Whalley (Lori), and Alfred Molina (Boris the Red Butcher) do their bungling bit for a movie that rides a running gag and flogs it almost to exhaustion. Art movie, it ain't. Artful entertainment, well, why not? Rated PG (Patrick Cornish)<br>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION<br>With the talent on display here - direction by Nicholas Hytner fresh off the Oscar-nominated The Madness of King George, script by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein, two bright young stars in Jennifer Aniston (Picture Perfect, TV's Friends) and Paul Rudd (Clueless) - you'd expect that this romantic comedy about a pregnant woman who falls in love with her gay best friend would be a cinch. Unfortunately, Wasserstein (adapting a novel by Stephen McCauley) turns what is potentially an interesting examination of marriage, masculinity and family into a series of amusing but not very memorable sitcom moments. By constantly pulling back from the edge the film is completely devoid of any sexual tension, which is lethal for any romantic comedy - hetero or homosexual. The Object of My Affection looks beautiful, with its squeaky clean, upper-crust New York settings and Woody Allen-ish jazzy score, but even Woody Allen has stopped making this kind of superficial Woody Allen movie (see Deconstructing Harry). Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>Recently out<br>AFTERGLOW<br>This romantic farce about two unhappily married Montreal couples who accidentally swap partners is pure Alan Rudolph - ambitious, eccentric, adult and very sexy but wildly uneven. What cannot be faulted are the luxuriant performances of Julie Christie as the depressed former horror-movie star and Nick Nolte as her randy handyman husband. These veterans glow so bright we have to squint to see their young co-stars Lara Flynn Boyle and Johnny Lee Miller. At the Windsor and Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BLUES BROTHERS 2000<br>The vast army of people who revere the original Blues Brothers will be disappointed with this vapid and timid sequel. While the original crackled with creativity, energy and laughs the latest instalment lacks nearly everything. But the music is to die for, with a supergroup consisting of B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Clarence Clemons, Stevie Winwood, Dr John, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Billy Preston and Isaac Hayes providing one of the great musical moments to grace the screen. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>FOR RICHER FOR POORER<br>Despite starring two of America's most popular TV actors, Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley, this comedy about a rich and unhappy Manhattan couple forced to hide out in Amish country is not funny. Not even Alley's extravagant gestures and Allen's screwed-up face can milk much more than a smile out of this lame effort. Rated M (Pam Brown)<br>ONE NIGHT STAND<br>The new film by British stylist Mike Figgis feels even emptier than usual. The plot, which concerns a TV commercial director played by Wesley Snipes whose one-night fling with Nastassja Kinski causes him to question his shallow, compromised career and lifestyle, is so slight and familiar. With almost nothing of interest in the story Figgis fills the abundant emptiness with big-city atmospherics, silky-sheeted sex and an oddly out-of-place sub-plot involving a gay man (Robert Downey jun.) dying of AIDS. At the Paradiso and Dalkeith. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING<br>Acclaimed novelist Richard Flanagan should be applauded for attempting a serious, European-styled art movie about the generational after-effects of World War II. It uses a complex structure to trace the story of a young woman of Slovenian heritage (Kerry Fox) who returns to her native Tasmania to uncover the dreadful secret of her mother's disappearance. Unfortunately, the various pieces don't add up to an emotionally satisfying whole. At the Astor and Ace Subiaco. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>UNDER THE SKIN<br>Writer-director Carine Adler wrenches her debut feature out of the safe milieu of British kitchen-sink drama. Adler uses jerky hand-held camera, disorienting jumpcuts, grainy stock and slow motion to tell the shattering story of a young woman's desperate search for love and identity after her mother's death. What also makes Under the Skin seem very un-British, almost European, is its raw sensuality, with grieving Iris (Samantha Morton) embarking on a self-destructive binge of casual sex. Tough, not always convincing but rewarding. At the Luna. Rated R (Mark Naglazas)<br>U.S. MARSHALS<br>This sequel to The Fugitive sticks closely to the 1994 blockbuster, with dogged Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) pursuing a seemingly innocent man and Wesley Snipes taking over the Harrison Ford role. Unfortunately, without Ford to stand up to the powerhouse Jones (who won an Oscar for his role in the original), U.S. Marshals feels like a one-armed action movie. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE WEDDING SINGER<br>There's absolutely no reason why this fluffy romance should be set in the mid-1980s apart from the opportunity to pack the soundtrack with rock and schlock from that era of glorious excess. What allows the audience to forget it is being manipulated like crazy are the affable performances of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore as the depressed wedding hall singer and the waitress engaged to the wrong man. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>Still on<br>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY<br>After the sweet inconsequentiality of his most recent films Woody Allen has descended into the dark night of his artistic soul and given birth, kicking and screaming, to a self-centred, pill-popping, skirt-chasing, foul-mouthed novelist named Harry Block. Bitter, black and drenched in self-loathing, this portrait of The Meanest Man on Earth (Allen's original title for the movie) is the writer-director's most original and envelope-pushing work for at least a decade. At the Windsor and Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>LOST IN SPACE<br>There's danger, Will Robinson!, at every turn as the space-age scientific family (headed by William Hurt and Mimi Rodgers) set out to colonise a new planet with Earth facing extinction. Witty one-liners keep the dialogue alive while amazing special effects steal the show. If the 1960s TV show was camp, this one is pure corn. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>PRIMARY COLORS<br>Mike Nichols' beautifully crafted adaptation of Joe "Anonymous' Klein's bestseller goes beyond a simple spoof on the embattled Clintons and deals with the more universal issue of idealism and pragmatism in the grubby world of modern politics. It also helps us understand how a small-time politician from a dirt-poor corner of the US became the most powerful man on Earth - and how, most importantly, he has survived numerous, potentially ruinous ?bimbo eruptions'. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE BIG LEBOWSKI<br>After the relatively straightforward Fargo, the Coen brothers are up to their old tricks again with another clever but maddeningly inconsequential genre spoof.This one features Jeff Bridges as a lazy, dope-smoking modern version of a Chandleresque detective. It's also their funniest movie yet - a wonderfully acted, laugh-out-loud knockabout comedy with several hilarious, dazzlingly photographed druggy dream sequences. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK<br>The famous musketeer cry of unity ?All for one and one for all' is uttered no less than seven times during this latest adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of two kings in the France of Louis XIV. However, the only ones not listening seem to be the film-makers themselves, who yank the film in too many directions at once. It's energetic and never dull but fails to establish a style that allows the audience to be swept up by this rousing romantic tale. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>Cinematheque<br>GALLIVANT<br>Something special this week at the Cinematheque - a new feature-length docu-drama about a film-maker who travels around the coast of Britain in a camper van, taking with him his 85-year old grandmother and seven-year old daughter. The girl suffers from Joubert's Syndrome, which hampers her walking and restricts her power of speech. ?Gallivant is that rare thing,? according to Sight and Sound, ?a celebratory film that never turns sugary or mawkish.?<br>The National Cinematheque is on each Saturday afternoon at the Cinema Paradiso. For details of tickets and times consult the Palace Cinemas ad Saturday's West or phone 9227 1771.<br></font></p>
