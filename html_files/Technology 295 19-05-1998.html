            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Attorney-General Peter Foss is no Bill Gates. This is a good thing really.<br>Last week Mr Foss launched the WA Justice Ministry's new Web site called Justice Online. An avid Internet user, he did the demonstration himself on a laptop with a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser.<br>But, unlike Mr Gates's personal demonstration of Windows98 in Chicago last month - marred by a famous crash - nothing went wrong for Mr Foss. It was smooth sailing all the way as he showed guests at the launch how to navigate through the 650 pages of information on tap at Justice Online.<br>Mr Foss even took the audience on a virtual tour of the Supreme Court with the surround video plug-in that loaded automatically with Explorer (Netscape users will have to download and install it manually).<br>The tour enables a 360-degree view of a mock trial and has clickable links on main features such as the prosecution, defence and jury.<br>The Justice Online site replaces one which ministry staff freely admit was awful. One even said it was possibly the worst site on the whole Web.<br>The new one is light years away from that category. Though it is neither flash nor of avant-garde design, it is light, fast and, above all, informative.<br>Staff led by manager of public affairs Sian Martin worked in co-operation with Perth company Pretzel Logic on a project that lasted 18 months and cost about $50,000 before Justice Online went public.<br>Their brief was to provide a Web site that would truly serve the public. It should do that well.<br>Mr Foss said the aim was to put out Government information, but for it to be seen from a public perspective. People needing the sort of information the ministry provided mainly were people who needed a problem solved.<br>The ambition, therefore, was to break the shackles of confusing legal terms and unhelpful red tape.<br>Justice Online shows people where they can find Justices of the Peace, marriage celebrants, how and where to pay fines, how to register births or deaths and even tells them the most common names for babies in WA. It lists all the State's courts and the hearings scheduled in them as well as the waiting time for cases to be heard.<br>Advice for victims of crime is available as well as news about the prison system; how many prisoners, how many cells and so forth.<br>Overall, it is a serious attempt to present as much information as possible in as user-friendly a way as possible.<br>Mr Foss believes many people will benefit now because the Internet continues to gain popularity and is being used more in homes, schools and public libraries. He believes one of the major benefits will be in education, with children able to find out much more about the machinery of justice in the State.<br></font></p>
