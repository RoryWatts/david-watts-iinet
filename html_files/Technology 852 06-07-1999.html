            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet has produced so many remarkable breakthroughs in its short history that it is easy to take them for granted.<br>One area where the medium is emerging as a playground for home users is music.<br>And one company that is leading the way in furnishing that musical playground is Real Networks, maker of RealPlayer, the virtual de facto standard for playing live video and audio off the Web.<br>Its latest development is the Real Jukebox player which Net users can download free in its current beta version.<br>The jukebox allows users to turn their PCs into veritable hi-fis. They can play, record, manage and add to their digital music collections.<br>The American PCMagazine said of the jukebox: ?... remarkable ... will change the way you listen to music on your PC forever.?<br>Maybe, but this remarkable development has to be put in context. It is by no means the greatest thing since sliced bread.<br>The jukebox allows people to record CDs on to their hard drives so that the sound card and speakers can take the place of normal household CD players. The quality of sound through its RMX format is described as ?near CD quality?. That is, it is not quite there, despite offering the flexibility of mixing a varied music collection on the PC.<br>Many average to lower-end home PCs may also put out less than high quality sound because they have insufficient memory, older soundcards or tinny speakers. A three-minute music track will also take up 2Mb of disk space.<br>However, the jukebox does allow playing and recording in MP3 format as well, opening up the rich resources of often-free digital music on the Web.<br>These MP3 songs can be downloaded and stored along with traditional CD songs in a PC music library which is easily maintained by the jukebox.<br>The present downsides of MP3 playing or downloading are the bandwidth constraints imposed by home users' average 56K and 28.8K connections.<br>These speeds make downloading of the often hefty music files a long and sometimes boring chore. And real-time or streaming audio playing of MP3 tracks off the Web presents problems when links are prone to interference.<br>Anyone who has listened to radio or watched video on the Web with RealPlayer will know about crackling sound, long pauses and stop-gap animation.<br>The remarkable thing is that it can be done and is improving in quality every month as connections become more stable.<br>One of the highlights of the jukebox which almost transcends worries about connection speeds and reliability is its ability to tap into resources on the Web to flesh out your knowledge of the music.<br>The jukebox, like a lot of less sophisticated software, allows people to listen to music from CDs put in the CD-Rom drive.<br>If you are connected to the Net at the same time you can use the jukebox's CDDB (basically CD database) function to list information about the CD you are playing such as track name, artist and track duration.<br>But more remarkable is that the jukebox will also provide links to sites about the artist, places where similar music can be downloaded or bought, and even works co-operatively with Amazon.com to pop up related literature and CDs for sale.<br>?Net users can also download for a free 30-day trial the latest version of the CuteFTP file transfer protocol program.<br>HELP DESK<br>Real Jukebox version 1.0b, file size 5.6Mb,<br>download time at 28.8K 26 minutes.<br>For Windows 95/98/NT.<br>Pentium 200 and 32Mb Ram recommended.<br>Download at:<br>www.real.com/products/<br>threeintlmusic.html<br>New CuteFTP:<br>www.globalscape.com<br></font></p>
