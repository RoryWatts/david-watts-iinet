            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE are women on the Net ... you've just got to wade through the testosterone to find them.<br>One good place to start is the excellent Beyond the Black Stump which carries Girl's WWWorld.<br>There are 62 links to female-dominated Web sites, including the International Network of Women in Technology, Voices of Women, Women's Medical Health and even Geek Girl.<br>A link to a site called Women on the Net brings the surfer face-to-face with the lovely quote: ?No guys .. this is not a collection of pictures of naked women in awkward positions! *larf* Rather it's a collection of everything I can find that's reasonable about women on the Net.?<br>It is an Australian site with lots of links to ?pages maintained by Aussie girls?, and one to Stephanie Brail's Home Page ... ?a girl from the US who maintains the Spiderwoman mailing list?.<br>The most disarming female site is Babes' World - the product of a moustachioed, macho-looking man called Robert Toups.<br>He is an enormous self-promoter with an ego to match, claiming his page is one of, if not the, most visited sites on the Web.<br>And he doesn't take criticism kindly. Half of his index page is devoted to a withering attack on a female journalist who had the temerity to be out of step with 200 other reviews of his site.<br>She was probably wrong because this is a good site, nothing to do with the pimple bursting, nerdy voyeurism that seems so prevalent.<br>Mr Toups invites women to submit the URLs of their pages, and he will display them if they are not being used to promote prostitution, strippers etc.<br>One of the 100 or so women in Babes is former porn star Brandy Alexandre who uses her page to lift the lid on adult movies and the hypocrisy of talkback shows, particularly one hosted by Australian tabloid TV hack Gordon Elliott.<br>URLs: Women on the Net:<br>http://www.healey.com.au/~hero/women.html<br>Beyond the Black Stump Girl's WWWeb:<br>http://werple.mira.net.au/~lions/women.htm<br>Babes on the Web:<br>http://www.tyrell.net/~robtoups/NETSCAPE-BABE.html<br>Brandy Alexandre's Page:<br>http://www.kamikaze.org/home.html<br></font></p>
