            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NO ONE loves me. Paul Keating answered my mail but that was the end of the relationship. Johhny Howard did not bother to write.<br>What have I done? Am I really so on the nose as to be an untouchable.<br>After all, it was their fault.<br>They - or people in the Labor and Liberal parties unknown - said I could take part in democracy of a new-fangled electronic kind on the Internet.<br>Tempting me was the chance to have the great debaters answer questions on-line about Australia's future in cyberspace.<br>At least Mr Keating - or perhaps an electronically literate henchman - had the good grace to talk to me.<br>Within 24 hours, there was the reply: ?Dear David, thank you for your e-mail. It might be quicker to send your questions via editor@alp.org.au.?<br>I rushed the questions through ... four days later still no response.<br>Mr Howard was a different matter.<br>The Liberals had been crowing about how their World Wide Web site had an electronic contact for every candidate.<br>There was space to write to the candidate of your choice all right. But all mail went to the same address.<br>I nonetheless posted Mr Howard my request to ask questions.<br>That was Monday.<br>The lackey who took my e-mail is perhaps still trying to catch Mr Howard.<br></font></p>
