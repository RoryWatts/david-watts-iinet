            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet throws up some unsavoury content at times. Last Wednesday, a World Wide Web site called CricInfo was showing Australia 7-175 at tea in Calcutta.<br>Shocking. And it became more obscene as the days passed - Australia all out 233, India 3-369 (that was Thursday) and India 5-633 (on Friday).<br>Obscene is not a bad word to describe it. Try these as well: miserable, pathetic, puny, dumb, terrible, awful, shocking, horrible and bad.<br>Another word that hopefully is not too optimistic - aberration.<br>The Australians can hardly get any worse in the final Test which starts tomorrow in Bangalore.<br>A nation has been searching for answers. Captain Mark Taylor has been quoted as uttering a comment as profound as the one used by the truck driver in the Swan Brewery ad (?you've got a job, so you do it.?)<br>The skipper's answer on Saturday night was: ?We didn't make enough runs, or take enough wickets.?<br>Advice and explanations abound. At a Melbourne Age Internet site, fans have weighed in with their recipes for an Australian comeback in Bangalore.<br>Responses yesterday were dominated by Indians - why not; they dominated the Test?<br>Most said Shane Warne should swear off the beans. One helpful soul said Australia could win if it recalled Don Bradman.<br>The best thing about the debacle was that not much was seen on TV. Channel 9, normally berated for failing to cover anything outside Australia and England, has aired a couple of hours of lowlights.<br>Nine showed a huge, colourful, enthusiastic and knowledgeable crowd going bonkers over beautiful batting (Mohammad Azharuddin must qualify as one of the great artists).<br>On Sunday afternoon, Nine displayed a nice sense of irony by playing an hour of Australia's dreadful last innings, followed by live coverage of the Sheffield Shield final from the WACA Ground.<br>One minute viewers could cry in our beers as Greg Blewett, Michael Slater, Mark Waugh etc. surrendered meekly; the next they could raise the same glasses to the Warriors as they walloped Tasmania.<br>Cruelly, just as we were licking our lips in anticipation of a Brendon Julian onslaught - he had just made 119 between lunch and tea - he was out lbw second ball into the coverage.<br>The juxtaposition of the awful Aussies and the wonderful Warriors almost seemed a good argument for secession.<br>Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, a loyal WA cricket supporter, did not go quite that far.<br>But he did tell the ABC yesterday: ?I think that it is a terrific thing that the regular unfairness with which West Australian players are treated in national selections, means that WA has the opportunity to deliver punishment for it.?<br></font></p>
