            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">US President Bill Clinton should have turned to the Internet before playing doctors and nurses with Monica Lewinsky.<br>The writing would have been on the wall - or the computer screen at least - that he and the young intern were not very compatible.<br>Bill and Hillary are even less compatible than Bill and Monica.<br>The ?facts? about compatibility that may have spared the world the sordid details of the Starr Report are readily available to any surfer of the World Wide Web at Dr Love's Love Calculator site.<br>The calculator might be the work of two Dutch software engineers - Matthijs Sypkens Smit and Thijs Kinkhorst - but it has very little to do with the precision of mathematics or science.<br>Although the details are shady, the calculator appears to function according to the basics of numerology. That is, letters of the alphabet are given numerical values which can be added, subtracted, squared, multiplied or whatever to suit the machinations of nerds like Mr Smit and Mr Kinkhorst.<br>Such machinations then allow a gullible public to become addicted to the mindless fun of typing names into the Love Calculator to see how compatible couples are.<br>It is of course the compatibility of the names . . . or rather the numbers behind the letters in the names . . . that is being presented.<br>Funnily, no matter how evident that is, Web surfers cannot get enough of the Love Calculator. More than three million people have visited the site since it opened in 1996.<br>Compatibility is shown as a percentage figure once a person types in two names in separate boxes at the calculator site.<br>For example, if you type Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, a separate screen pops up showing their names and the figure ?27%?.<br>This is accompanied by a little message from the mythical Dr Love. In Bill and Monica's case, the message says: ?The chance of a relationship working out between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky is not very big, but a relationship is very well possible, if the two of you really want it to, and are prepared to make some sacrifices for it. You'll have to spend a lot of quality time together.?<br>The result for Bill and Hillary is only 12 per cent, and the message is more disheartening. It starts: ?Dr Love thinks a relationship might work out between Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham, but the chance is very small.?<br>In the interests of quasi-scientific endeavour, Websightings took an entire afternoon testing the Love Calculator this week and found the following results:<br>James Packer - Kate Fischer: 96 per cent<br>Humphrey Bogart-Lauren Bacall: 87; Homer Simpson-Marj Bouvier (her maiden name): 22; Fran Fine - Maxwell Sheffield: 84; Tommy Lee-Pamela Anderson: 69; David Beckham-Victoria Adams: 23 (but 93 if you call her Posh Spice); Romeo - Juliet 98 (but only 66 if you put in their surnames). Net users can even download the program behind the Love Calculator and set it up on their home machines. The program is small and - unlike Bill and Hillary - eminently compatible with all makes of computer. All it lacks are the little messages from Dr Love.<br>If one-to-one relationships become too boring, Dr Love also offers a Mass Calculator at the site. This allows a user to type in the name of one party, then dozens of others in a separate field. Results show the compatibility rating of the one person with every other person named.<br>It is even possible to send an e-mail to the site containing a list of names and a quick response showing compatibility ratings is promised.<br>All in all it is absolute tosh but the perfect way to look busy in front of a screen . . . if you can suppress the giggles of disbelief.<br>Love Calculator:<br>www.lovecalculator.com<br></font></p>
