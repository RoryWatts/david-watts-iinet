            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET users are writing to the Labor Party's official Net site to attack Prime Minister Paul Keating and the Government.<br>The Soapbox site allows World Wide Web users to fill in a form with comments about political issues which is then e-mailed to the party.<br>Comments are published electronically at the site.<br>Before the election was announced, published comments were almost totally pro-Government.<br>The day the March 2 poll was set there was even an anodyne message from a Victorian supporter saying: ?I would like to wish the Labor Party good luck in the coming election. I think you are going to win.?<br>But the next message was far less complimentary. Sent on Sunday, it was a plea for a fairer family law system from Emmanuel Theodosiou, president of the Queensland organisation, Children And Parents After Separation.<br>He accused both Federal and State Labor Governments of destroying the family.<br>Noting that he was not a Liberal, Mr Theodosiou wrote: ?The policy structure of the ALP seems to be to destroy the family unit and provide "stop gap' measures to pay for lousy policy initiatives.<br>?Is there anyone out there, sitting member or candidate, who will support families in Australia??<br>The next published message, again written on Sunday by an Internet user who did not give his name, was virtually a rehash of Labor's winning 1972 slogan ?It's Time?, but with a twist.<br>Headlined ?Time for a change - vote Liberal!?, the message said: ?As far as I am concerned this country of ours does not have one single decent politician.<br>?They are all corrupt and live with the philosophy of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.<br>?Well it's time for a change. John Howard may be no better, or God forbid, an even worse PM than Paul Keating has been ... but that's the chance the people of Australia must take.?<br>The message ended: ?Liberal and proud of it.?<br>The Liberals do not have an official Internet site but supporters have set up Net pages outlining policies, history and philosophy of the party.<br>Comments can be e-mailed, but are not published.<br></font></p>
