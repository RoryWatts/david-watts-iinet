            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">One of the best things about the World Wide Web is that you do not have to be a rocket scientist to make your mark on it. Creating documents in HTML - hyper text markup language - is not too taxing if you are prepared to concentrate and work at it. The next logical step, publishing your pages, is a similar rewarding challenge.<br>DAVID WATTS explains how it's done.<br>The Web offers users the chance to say what they want to a rapidly growing global audience approaching 100 million. A recent report in the Guardian newspaper said about 10,000 people a day were publishing Web pages. It added that about five million Internet users had established sites and estimated that between 20 and 50 per cent would eventually do so.With 100 million users, that means between 15 and 45 million people are expected to join the trend often known as vanity publishing.<br>The assumption throughout this guide is that you are familiar with basic HTML and have created, or are about to create, a group of pages that could be called a Web site.<br>1: Finding a home for your home page:<br>Users' pages are held on Web servers - computers run mostly by Internet Service Providers.<br>Most major providers in WA offer room on their computers for members' pages as part of normal accounts - there is no extra charge, within certain limits. Check your ISP's home page under the heading, services or products.<br>The amount of space offered varies. For example, Global Web and Highway 1 allow 5Mb of storage for pages and e-mail. iiNet Technologies offers 10Mb, Wantree 20Mb and Omen between 10 and 20Mb, depending on the type of account.<br>The national operators OzEmail and Telstra BigPond allow 5Mb. In today's world of 4Gb disks, those figures may sound puny. But it would take a heavyweight site with interactive multimedia and whopping graphics to trouble the providers.<br>The best place to check what ISPs are offering is the WA ISP list, a comprehensive listing of the State's providers, summary of services offered and links to their home pages.<br>Descriptions of Web hosting services will normally spell out in detail how to make your own space on the server. Basically, the user has to tell the server electronically that they want to use a directory for their pages.<br>The most common tool to do this, according to a random sampling of ISP guides, is Telnet. Telnet is computing in the raw. It sheds all the graphical hoo-ha associated with Netscape, Explorer or Eudora, for example, and allows direct communication with the ISP's nominated server (they will give you the address which will be something like computer.myisp.com.au).<br>After logging on, the user typically issues a command such as ?makewww? or ?createpage? (it varies according to ISPs) and that's it. You have now set up a directory on the Web server for your pages and will have a site on the Web called something like www.myisp.com.au/ ~user<br>Such an action will also set up a default home page. It may be index.html or default.html, depending on the ISP.The HTML page you intend to use as your main, or home, page on the Web should bear that name, so that when you get around to uploading - or sending - it follows the ISP's filename structure.Thus your home page on the Web will be something like www.myisp.com.au/ ~user/index.html, and it will be able to be called up with www.myisp.com.au/ ~user/<br>An alternative to ISP Web hosting well worth a look is with a service like GeoCities, an American company that offers free space for pages among its so-called Neighbourhoods.<br>GeoCities offers easily-followed authoring and file management utilities, graded to a user's experience, so that publishing is basically a follow-the-prompts exercise.<br>Its categorisation of Web pages is restrictive if you are a Renaissance-type person with a broad range of interests. However, its user base has grown from 10,000 pages in October, 1995, to one million last October, suggesting it is not a bad way to get on the Web.<br>2: Go back to your computer and get organised:<br>The HTML pages and any associated files such as graphics or sounds should reside in directories on your own computer that mirror those on your Web server. Filenames should be the same where possible.Most servers in WA are Unix-based and therefore stringent about filenames. You may have a PC that lets you call up a file called JIM.GIF by typing in jim.gif. But if you load JIM.GIF to your server then try to access it on the Web by typing jim.gif, it won't be able to find it. Unix servers will also use the extension .html for hyper-text files. Older systems such as Windows 3.1 can only create three-letter extensions like .htm, so be prepared to do a bit of file-renaming when you load such files to your server.<br>The structuring of directories is important. If they follow the same logic as on the server, then you can write and test your HTML offline and it should work exactly as if you were on the Web. When writing HTML, the back slashes in PC names can often be replaced with the forward slashes of Web server directories and still work on your own PC because of the sophistication of most HTML editors and browsers.<br>Different directory structures can mean a lot of unnecessary coding and superfluous files as well as restrictions on offline testing. It is recommended you have a main folder for your HTML files, especially the all-important index or default, and a sub-folder for images - usually JPEGs and GIFs. You can set up other sub-folders as the need arises and you want clearer organisation of your site.<br>Say you want to create some pages about cats, a subject that does not sit well with your main pages which might deal with Plato or thermodynamics (who knows?). Just set up a sub-folder called cats and create any feline pages in there.<br>Thus you might have a structure on your hard disk with c:\web (your main HTML folder), c:\web\images (for your images) and c:\web\cats (for the moggies).<br>Logical directory structures allow HTML to be written using relative paths when linking to files within your site. Relative paths allow faster access than pointing to the exact or absolute address - or URL.<br>A graphical illustration of relative path addressing is available at Web Tutor, an excellent guide to HTML.<br>3: Testing, testing, testing:<br>Before publishing any pages, check them thoroughly. Have an HTML editor open and a browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer in offline mode. WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors are fine in the early stages of creation, but go straight to the raw HTML code for fine-tuning and checking.<br>Troubles that can arise include incorrect filenames (either the name or the directory), overblown or badly treated graphics, incorrect coding, particularly incomplete tags, or missing files. A browser in offline mode reads local HTML rapidly. Just type the location of the file you want in the location or address bar and hit enter. For example, if you wanted to check a cat file, you might type: c:\web\cats\cat.html<br>Click any local links to check they take you to the desired file. If you click on outside links, your browser will either protest or try to dial your Net connection, depending on your configuration.<br>It is not a bad idea to call your local HTML files up while online to verify that external links do work.<br>And don't forget that some good HTML editors such as Homesite, HotDog, FrontPage and PageMill have excellent preview modes that work like browsers.<br>4: Upload and away:<br>Here you will meet the flexible and speedy FTP, or File Transfer Protocol. Despite the efforts of browser and HTML editor programmers, FTP remains the easiest way to send, or upload, your files to a Web server.<br>Popular FTP programs are CuteFTP, FTP Voyager and WS FTP for the PC and Anarchie for the Mac. WS is less glamorous-looking than the others but is still effective. FTP Voyager presents an exact replica of the Windows Explorer and has easy drag-and-drop facilities. And CuteFTP just does its job simply and quickly.<br>A good FTP program will allow you to set up the parameters for connection to your server's site. These are site address, logon name and password (from your ISP account), and you can add which local directory you'd like to start in (c:\web in our example) and to which remote directory you'd like to connect.<br>On connection you will usually be presented with a window showing the directory and files on your PC and another window with the directory and files, if any, on your server (you may have to navigate to your page directory, full names of directories on servers can be exhausting). FTP then allows you to copy a file, group of files, or entire directory, from your PC to the server. Methods vary, but the operation is called uploading. FTP programs also allow you to create directories, rename files, delete files or view them on either system.<br>You should ask your ISP which FTP program it recommends. Often an ISP will have provided one with your setup software, or have copies that can be downloaded via browser for installation on your hard disk.<br>None is terribly resource hungry nor taxing on space. There are good FTP repositories at major software sites like Download.com, Tucows, Beyond the Black Stump, and Consumate Winsock.<br>HTML editors can also send pages to servers. You cannot usually rename files or create directories on your server from an editor program, however.<br>Programs like HotDog promise a Web site management regime on your local system as well as mass publishing abilities. You need to read the help files thoroughly and have a good poke around before the publishing ability becomes apparent.<br>The best PC WYSIWYG editor, Microsoft FrontPage98, devotes a lot to its Web Explorer side which manages sites on your system as if they were on an outside server.<br>This shows a lot of potential, although it has the annoying habit of intruding on and re-configuring previous creations. The biggest hurdle is that only a handful of ISPs can handle sites published by FrontPage. More are gearing up to NT servers to complement their mainly Unix equipment, so more people will be able to publish with FrontPage.<br>At the moment it is better to use the Web editor, and experiment with the Explorer as a site-management tool because it offers good, graphic representations of how files relate to each other.<br>5: Tell the world:<br>When you've Telnet-ed, browsed and FTP'd yourself on to the Web, it would possibly be a bit daft to stay quiet about it. You should submit your site to major search engines like Yahoo, AltaVista and Lycos by following the submit URL links at their sites. Or you can go to a site like SubmitIt and notify as many search engines as you want with one hit.<br>You can also use the Meta tag ability of your HTML files to alert search engines about the content of your pages. For example, if your pages deal with Plato and cats, you could add a line of HTML code under the section of your home page file, saying something like . Don't be tempted to draw engines' attention with sensational but irrelevant content descriptions like ?sex?. It is annoying for people searching for genuine information and most big engines now filter it out.<br>Recognition of content through Meta tags can make your page appear higher in a search list.<br>Help Desk<br>Micrografx: www.micrografx.com<br>Franklin: www.franklin.com<br>Ricoh: www.ricoh-aust.com.au, www.ricoh.com.au<br>Links to basic HTML guides and editors:<br>www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/access/htmhelp.html<br>WA ISP list: www.cynosure.com.au/isp/<br>Telnet: text-based application that lets you log on to a Unix computer, typically your ISP's (if you have shell account access).
