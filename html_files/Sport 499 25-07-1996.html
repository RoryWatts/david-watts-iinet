            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WOULDN'T have mattered if the Australian three-day event team missed our second gold medal late last night. The guts and determination of Gillian Rolton had won the equestrians a bigger prize already.<br>There has been no more dramatic television moment at these Games then early yesterday when Rolton - who had already fallen on the flat and broken a collarbone and two ribs - was jarred sickeningly from her mount Peppermint Grove and landed on her shoulder at the water jump.<br>But she ploughed on, obviously in pain and not as much in command of her horse as she would have liked.<br>With flag carrier Andrew Hoy still to ride, Rolton's ride may have been important to the Australian tally. In the end it wasn't. In fact, her score was discarded and the team rocketed from sixth after the dressage to first, a commanding 61 points clear of the US.<br>What an embodiment of the Olympic spirit, but what a let-down that Channel 7 could not bring us scores during the event.<br>We had pictures of an obvious drama, but no context in which to frame them. Stan Grant and Lucinda Green, an unlikely duo, said something vague about the computers not being linked up. They thought Australia was on top after Hoy's brilliant ride on Darien Powers.<br>THAT is what they told midnight anchorman David Fordham when he crossed to them, although Fordham, rugby man to the bootlaces, was more interested in talking about Bo Derek for a while.<br>Asked why Australia was in charge, Grant told Fordham: ?They came out here and absolutely gunned it?.<br>Perhaps Grant should leave the talking to Green. At least she knows the Queen's English. If you asked Grant if he knew the Queen's English he'd probably say: ?Is she??<br>To be brutally honest, Grant is out of his depth and just as guilty as others of putting the mockers on.<br>?Australia are in a very, very strong position. We don't want to jinx them by saying it. They are in a very strong position. Could well be gold here tomorrow,? he told Fordham.<br>Brutal honesty reigned at the home of the bronzed Aussie, the pool.<br>Steven Dewick, having finished sixth in a 100m backstroke heat he would rather forget, told Linley Frame he was lousy.<br>Looking lower than a snake's belly, he said that the medley relay team was a medal chance if he swam well, but nowhere if he continued to be lousy.<br>It was a moment of awful self-punishment. In fact the poolside chats are getting a bit dark and gloomy to match our performance.<br>Yesterday there seemed to be a lot of psychoanalysis in comparison to the first day joy of, say, Sarah Ryan, who, painted fingernails and all, looked as if she was about to jump all over Neil Brooks such was her elation at making the 100m freestyle final.<br></font></p>
