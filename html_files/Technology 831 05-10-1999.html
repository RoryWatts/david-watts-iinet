            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE speed and global reach of the Internet has given rise to a new industry - the almost daily production of lists.<br>Latest notable entrants in this field are:<br>?Cnet with its list of the 10 essential Web sites.<br>?Business Week's inaugural e.biz 25, a list of the 25 leading innovators and most influential people in the industry.<br>?The Lycos search engine's weekly list of the 50 most searched-for words or phrases.<br>Cnet, an American online publisher and technical news organisation, claims its 10 sites are ones that every Net user should bookmark.<br>It has resisted the temptation to include its own sites in the list, despite running some of the more helpful technical pages on the Web such as builder.com for site developers and download.com for shareware enthusiasts.<br>Cnet's recommended sites are claimed to be high rankers at Media Metrix, which is fast becoming the Net's equivalent of a TV ratings service.<br>?These are the sites we surf when we want to find something on the Web, build a home page, go shopping, hear the latest tech buzz, groove to funky tunes, or fire off an e-mail message. In short, these are the most supremely useful sites on the Net,? cnet says.<br>It has broken the list into five categories - the Big Enchiladas, Fabulous Free Stuff, Shop Till You Drop, See the Real World and Goodies for Techies.<br>Yahoo and Microsoft are rated the two essential Big Enchilada sites - that is they are considered the best information providers of those produced by giant Net companies.<br>GeoCities and Hotmail are the two Fabulous Free Stuff sites. GeoCities wins its listing because it provides free space for more than 4.5 million people to house their personal sites.<br>The Hotmail free e-mail service is applauded for its speed of access and message composition design.<br>AMAZON.COM, the pioneer of selling goods on a massive scale on the Web tops the Shop Till You Drop category. Cnet has ranked the pioneering eBay online auction site as the next best in this area.<br>The See the Real World category concentrates on library-like research and the Web's ability to deliver travel planning more efficiently than in the real world.<br>The recommended sites in this section are Encarta and Preview Travel.<br>Slashdot.org and MP3.com rank as the most essential Goodies for Techies sites.<br>Business Week drew up its e.biz 25 list because it believes the current e-commerce revolution is as profound a transformation in society as was the industrial revolution.<br>?It's clear that while technology laid the foundations for the Web's first wave, it is sharp thinking by individuals that's powering the second wave - the e-business revolution,? staff writer Steve Hamm says in the magazine's latest edition.<br>The shock omission is Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who the magazine describes as the daredevil of the PC generation.<br>But the nature of the Net - its creative chaos - meant there was now a redistribution in leadersip, and no place for Mr Gates.<br>Among the 25 who did make the list are Yahoo chief executive Timothy Koogle, financier Masayoshi Son, of Softbank Corp, and e-commerce king Jeffrey Bezos, of Amazon.com.<br>The Lycos search engine believes it is virtually tapping into the Net community's brains with its weekly update of a list of the 50 most searched-for topics.<br>The list, called the Lycos 50, ranks the people, places and things which Lycos says were most on the public mind in the preceding week.<br>For example, the top search three weeks ago was Hurricane Floyd.<br>The information is gathered each Monday by sorting the top 50 requests from the 12 million words typed into the Lycos search box each week. Pornographic, four-letter words and lewd queries, including names of adult film stars are excluded.<br>The top 50 last week was headed by searches for the popular game Pokemon. Britney Spears, Pamela Anderson Lee and the Backstreet Boys also featured in the top 10.<br></font></p>
