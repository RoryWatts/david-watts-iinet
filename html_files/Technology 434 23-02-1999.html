            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GOOD things are worth waiting for. This is the case with the Rottnest Island Web Site developed by Perth company Pretzel Logic.<br>The site was launched for the Rottnest Island Authority late last year, but its full effect could not be appreciated in tests by The West Australian using Netscape browsers until recently.<br>Netscape had trouble with the Macromedia Flash technology needed to run the site's highlight, the virtual bike ride. It worked with Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Netscape handled other Flash sites smoothly.<br>But now those hiccups have gone, allowing full enjoyment of what must be one of WA's best thought-out sites.<br>The bike ride gives Web surfers a ?ride? around the island, with the chance to visit 14 stops, including Thomson Bay, Little Parakeet, the Salt Lakes, Parker Point and West End.<br>Some stops have still pictures, others have Surround Video, a 360-degree image that users can move around as if watching a film.<br>WA Web users may not be surprised at the attractions they see. But they may be surprised at the ease of navigation and how the latest Net technology can make something so well known more appealing.<br>Those around the world will get an eyeful of something new and exotic.<br>One of the aims of the site is to attract more visitors, whether from overseas or over east. This potential was seen by Gordon Hill of the authority at the site's launch.<br>The Rottnest Island Authority is very excited to be finally offering a site that local, interstate and international visitors, and more importantly, potential visitors, can enjoy exploring, he said.<br>Pretzel Logic says it has designed the site to try to match Rottnest's relaxed atmosphere.<br>Its brief from the authority was to provide potential visitors with all the information they would need. In doing so, the many pages also provide a rich source of knowledge in one package.<br>The list is comprehensive. There is a section for school children who want project help, navigation maps and surf and tide conditions, notes on the history and the environment, guides on booking accommodation accompanied by Adobe Acrobat maps showing where that accommodation is, and an all-important introduction to the quokka.<br>Surfers can also send virtual postcards, look at a gallery of Rottnest pictures and read the authority's latest newsletter.<br>The vital question of how to get to Rottnest is answered at a page which is enhanced by links to the Rottnest Express and Oceanic Cruises sites. Contact details for Boat Torque 2000, Captain Cook Cruises and Jandakot airport are also online.<br>HELP DESK<br>Rottnest Island Web site: www.rottnest.wa.gov.au<br>Pretzel Logic: www.pretzel.com.au<br>Rottnest Express: www.rottnestexpress.com.au<br>Oceanic Cruises: www.oceaniccruises.com.au<br></font></p>
