            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Johnny Mnemonic<br>Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren<br>Directed by Robert Longo<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>TO SAY that Keanu Reeves's latest star vehicle Johnny Mnemonic won't be everyone's cup of tea would be a poor choice of words. More like ... not everyone's drop of acid, or tab of ecstasy.<br>This exciting futuristic tale is not a mums and dads movie. With rock poets Henry Rollins and Ice-T playing major roles and a bleak, at times unpleasant, setting always in the dark, it is not a sunny, happy film.<br>Yet it doesn't take itself too seriously and the cyberpunk otherworldliness of scriptwriter William Gibson has a fascination, as do the wizard special effects and computer graphics.<br>There are times when Johnny Mnemonic, despite its darkness, has its tongue very firmly planted in cheek.<br>For example when all seems lost Reeves as Johnny bemoans his lot to his spunky tough bodyguard, Jane, played by Dina Meyer, in a lovely take-off of Peter Finch in Network.<br>Where Finch yelled, ?I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more?, Johnny cries, ?I just want room service ...?, then goes on to list the good things involved, including ?a $10,000 a night hooker?.<br>Well, it is the future - none too distant though in 2021, so many things are recognisable.<br>Life 26 years from now, according to Gibson's script, will be dominated by the Internet and virtual reality. Big corporations will control all information and the have-nots or LoTeks will scramble on the streets, many of them victims of a disease caused by electromagnetic fields generated by the super-abundance of technology needed to live.<br>This is the world where people like Johnny are essential. They are mnemonic couriers, shedding their own memories so data can be implanted and smuggled between corporations.<br>Johnny gets his chip in the old block from a group of what turn out to be altruistic scientists new to the game of smuggling. In the middle of generating the code that will later allow Johnny to shed his data to a paying customer, the Japanese Yakuza enter and blast the scientists.<br>Johnny, all alone, tries to work out who his data is intended for and along the way finds no one likes him.<br>The company from which the data was stolen wants his head frozen and his slimy crime boss Ralphie (Udo Kier) has sold him out.<br>The really bad news is that Johnny's data load is twice what it should be and he will die within 24 hours if he doesn't get rid of it.<br>The Tarzan-strong Jane enters, saves Johnny's head from a Yakuza ice bucket and the two go in search of a way to get rid of the deadly data, using virtual reality computers that just could exist in 26 years, and lots of violent street battles.<br>Back at the ranch, the bereaved boss of the pharmaceutical company from which Johnny's data has been stolen has hired the mercenary, mad and mostly bionic Street Preacher (Dolph Lundgren looking like Charlton Heston as Moses) to send Johnny ?to Jesus? - a task he relishes as he bumps off others by crucifying them.<br>Johnny and Jane discover the secret of the data through meetings with Rollins' crazed good doctor Spider and Ice-T's street guerilla leader, J-Bone.<br>All come together for a climactic battle in which two surprise sources come to the aid of Johnny and Jane.<br>Reeves is always likable. This is no exceptional performance but he is a good screen hero with his boyishness and clean-cut looks. Lundgren's role is the only bit of padding in an otherwise tight and hard film.<br>First-time feature director Robert Longo has been criticised for making a slack version of Blade Runner but he has done well here, providing both the believability and fancy that bring Gibson's grim drama to life.<br></font></p>
