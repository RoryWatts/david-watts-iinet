            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOMEONE wise once said football is a funny old game. Too true.<br>Why else would a band of apparently happy Blues supporters sing ?We Are the Navy Blues? just minutes after Carlton lost to West Coast on Sunday?<br>They warbled away while troops of perplexed Eagles fans shuffled past on their way out of Subiaco Oval.<br>Carlton had just lost its seventh straight match and West Coast had broken a four-game duck. Please explain, as Pauline Hanson might say.<br>Football support - even from the armchair - requires faith. The seemingly thrilled Carlton barrackers were obviously pleased to see their chosen team was not a complete joke as might have been thought after the previous week's 89-point thrashing by Port Adelaide.<br>The manner of the Blues comeback from a 44-point deficit to lose by just eight points would have renewed their faith.<br>What then could relight the fires for Eagles fans who almost saw a repeat of the choke against St Kilda, and whose side kicked abysmally?<br>Using childlike logic you could say that they really were eight goals better than Carlton and really looked a 20.12 team rather than a 12.20 one.<br>Unfortunately that explanation denies reality.<br>Or you could focus on coach Mick Malthouse's explanation. He said after the game: ?The side will ebb and flow from time to time, given the fact that we have had almost a 50 per cent turnover in personnel in the last three years.?<br>The Eagles have had to find about 16 new faces since 1995, according to a list of everyone who has represented the team on display at the club's official Internet site.<br>Names from 1995 no longer with them include Peter Sumich, Peter Wilson, David Hart, Michael Brennan, Karl Langdon, David Hynes, Don Pyke and Brayden Lyle.<br>You can throw in Brett Spinks, Jason Heatley and Shane Bond too.<br>However, 13 members of the team that just beat Carlton on Sunday were around in 1995. And 18 of the 22 were listed as having played in 1996.<br>Significantly, Andrew Donnelly, Ben Cousins and Fraser Gehrig were all regulars that year which was marred by long absences by Glen Jakovich and John Worsfold because of knee reconstructions. A key missing element from 1996 is Chris Mainwaring, due to resume soon. Mitchell White, another 96 trump card, is possibly not far off a proper return.<br>Now that 1996 bunch lost four games on the trot, then won 11 straight to finish the year with a 15-7 record, 125 per cent and in fourth place.<br>Would it be too much of a leap of faith for Eagles supporters to expect a similar turnaround this year? Statistically speaking, it appears reasonable.<br>But has there been a more even competition? There are no easybeat Fitzroys or Melbournes. Richmond is roaring. The Bulldogs are giving their backers faith that they might see the club's second flag.<br>Teams in a similar boat to West Coast include Adelaide, Geelong, Essendon and Brisbane.<br>Something has got to break soon.<br>Let's hope it is not the faith.<br></font></p>
