            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE developers must be spitting microchips. Their work from late 1994 made the World Wide Web easily accessible and popular.<br>Microsoft piggy-backed on their ideas, producing good browsers that came close but could not beat Netscape's.<br>Now the browser battle is all but over. Microsoft has blown it apart with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, released last week. It is only in pre-release - that is, it is not even beta software - yet its potential is enormous.<br>And Microsoft has served notice that Net users will have to make a definite choice between it and Netscape.<br>MSIE 4.0 uses dynamic HTML which gives users more control over the look of their sites. Netscape does not support it at the moment, so users face the possibility of not being able to see some Web content at all.<br>MSIE 4.0 is far more than a Web browser or Internet tool. It changes the way we look at a computer and in doing so makes it easier and friendlier.<br>The operating shell enhancements show us what Windows 97-98 will look like. The browser is not just for the Web, it is for the entire operating system.<br>In typical Microsoft fashion the software tends to take over the computer. Instead of the annoyances of previous Internet Explorers where they became default browsers and grabbed Netscape bookmarks, this time there is method in the apparent madness.<br>MSIE 4.0 places a browser view on every operation, so that, for example, the Windows 95 Desktop can be seen in a browser window.<br>This allows for one-click operation - like clicking on a Web link - to open any application. It also allows use of a back or forward arrow to scroll easily to other folders or apps.<br>Dial-up access is on demand from any application, including Windows Explorer. If you want to connect to an FTP site to download software, you can go to Windows Explorer, type the FTP address in the browser window of the enhanced toolbar and you will be connected to the site.<br>This overcomes a weakness of earlier MSIE versions. They could not compete with Netscape's FTP abilities. Now it is likely that excellent software like Cute FTP and WS FTP will feel MSIE's blows too.<br>Even IBM's Notes client juggernaut is likely to feel a chill wind blowing through. The Web Ahead feature in Notes has been copied and improved on somewhat.<br>This is through the new auto-pilot Subscriptions feature which puts the computer on auto-pilot. Dial the Net between midnight and 5am, find favourite URLs and report to the desktop whether these have been updated.<br>For example, if you bookmark the Times of London's front page and tell MSIE 4.0 to add it to your subscriptions, the system will connect to the Net automatically at a set time (say, midnight), find the URL and whether it's been updated and report that fact with a highlighted icon on the taskbar.<br>When the user looks at his screen in the morning he will see the Times has been updated. One click on the icon and he can read the new front page offline.<br>Obviously people on time-charged accounts will have to be careful. Unattended browsing takes no account of congestion or unavailable sites.<br>Put the Web browser in offline mode, and you can read all the pages in your cache by using the normal Web URLs, and not by the convoluted and fragmented file names of the past.<br>Not all the new features are to do with the on-screen environment. Power printing is an admission that many surfers like to see paper copies of favourite sites.<br>This allows any link on a page to be right-clicked. Select print target and MSIE goes to the nominated URL and prints it.<br>A link documents option even lets you print all documents linked to the one you are viewing. This may be useful, but you could empty your paper tray with a single click on a site with many links.<br>?Next week: getting under the bonnet of MSIE 4.0.<br></font></p>
