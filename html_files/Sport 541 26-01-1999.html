            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SORRY Ian Botham, you were out of order. It was bizarre, it was unnecessary, it did nothing for the game of cricket.<br>Botham, commentating on Channel 9 on Saturday, used similar words to attack umpire Ross Emerson for calling Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan.<br>He wrongly cited Oscar Wilde - later correcting this to Andy Warhol - to say every man had his 15 minutes of fame and ?well done Ross, you've had it?.<br>And so did Botham. As if his fame as a great all-round cricketer and general hell-raiser was not enough, Botham hogged the microphone for at least 15 minutes to give his withering opinion of the throwing call and the subsequent Sri Lankan dummy spit.<br>His colleague Bill Lawry got a few words in, mostly sounding like a witness to a horrible road accident.<br>Viewers of what, amid all the bombast and tantrums, was a thrilling game, were soaked in Botham's venom during the entire 14 minutes of the incident.<br>Nine, quite rightly, did not break for an advertisement nor go to race six at Caulfield. The cameras stuck with the tempest on the Adelaide Oval, and the microphone stuck with the howling gale of Botham's contempt.<br>And the man, who had had a good tour up to then with generally calm and thoughtful insights, raised as many questions about the role of the commentator as he did about the umpire.<br>Umpire Emerson had the perfect right to no-ball a delivery that in his opinion was invalid.<br>But did Botham have the right to say: ?All Muralitharan's twists and turns are with his wrist not his arm. There is nothing at all wrong with his action.?<br>That is his opinion and, thanks to the technology of his station which routinely replays Muralitharan's deliveries, all viewers are quite capable of forming their own opinions.<br>And how about this Botham blast: ?Here we have a club cricketer Emerson, the man who is telling the ICC throwing committee that they don't know what they are talking about.?<br>The ICC throwing sub-committee, as a nervous-looking Doug Insole later explained to Richie Benaud, had talked about Muralitharan and passed his action at the time queries were raised.<br>But that did not preclude any umpire from subsequently judging his action to be wrong.<br>?Bowlers can throw at any time and there are bowlers with very good actions who put a bit extra into it and they throw,? Insole said.<br>?On that basis, there's no way you can say to an umpire: "You won't no-ball this chap'.?<br>And Botham's claims that Emerson's actions did nothing for the game of cricket?<br>When Benaud surfaced after the Botham spray, he put everything into a different, though no less dramatic light, when he said: ?There has never been any respite from controversy in cricket.?<br>It echoed Lawry's plaintive statement earlier that ?it's only a simple game, cricket ... but it has lots of complications?.<br></font></p>
