            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS column has been declared a football-free zone today. In no way have I gone off my obsession with big, boofy blokes chasing leather in Australian football, soccer, both codes of rugby, gridiron or even Gaelic football, for that matter.<br>But the airwaves will be so full of football on Sunday, I need some space, so will lay off a topic dear to my heart.<br>I can't wait. Channel 7 will have two AFL games in a row with the ?bigger than Ben Hur Sydney-Eagles clash? at 1.20pm. Ashley McIntosh will wrestle with Tony Lockett as big Plugger tries to break the AFL goal-kicking record.<br>While this is going on, the ABC will beam Bobby Despotovski and the boys of Perth Glory giving it their all against Sydney United in a bid for a magical grand final spot.<br>Foxtel, which I also have, has drawn the short straw and will be showing live rugby league.<br>Luckily I have three TV sets, so I plan to line them all up next to each other in the living room and watch so much football that my brain hurts.<br>Observant readers will ask how I plan to watch three televisions-worth of non-stop on-field violence with only one. And it is a fair question. Honestly, I have not worked that one out but rest assured I will be doing everything in my power so I don't miss a moment.<br>All that footy to look forward to . . . that is why I am not writing about it today. Not a word will pass my fingertips.<br>If you wonder why I will choose to veg out on the couch in front of three televisions, two VCRs and an assortment of remote controls, not to mention umpteen games of three different codes of football, I would have to say it is because I haven't got a life.<br>This is the result of being a parent, which many of you will know leads to permanent poverty and the inability to go out anywhere on a Sunday . . . hence the need to soak in football.<br>Many who have teenagers will be familiar with the following scenarios:<br>Teen: Dad I need my pocket money.<br>DOD (Dear Old Dad): Here you go darling, $5, is that ok?<br>Teen (taking a $10 note out of DOD's wallet): Get a life, Dad. And I need some money for the movies this afternoon.<br>DOD: What about your pocket money?<br>Teen (lifting $25 from ever-lightening wallet): Be serious, Dad. Oh, and I need braces.<br>At which point DOD writes out a huge cheque so some nice man can update to this year's model Porsche.<br>And so it goes. That is why I'll surround myself with footy, soccer and rugby and order the rest of the family to leave me in poverty-stricken peace.<br>Another reason I do not want to talk about football is that I believe it is starting to affect my language.The other day I heard Dennis Cometti tell Liam Bartlett in a radio interview that he thought some of his co-commentators got a bit carried away, trying to make a science out of a simple game.<br>I have to agree. I hear it all weekend and when I ring my Eagles mate Bill to have a natter about the weekend's events, the conversations invariably go like this:<br>Me: I've got two words for you Bill - leg speed and desire.<br>Bill: That's three, but how were the small, crumbing-type players? Did they get the hard ball by being first to the contest and by getting front and square in the space left by the leading talls?<br>Me: Absolutely centimetre perfect and they showed compassion and commitment as well as an ability to transform their run-with players into running types out of the centre.<br>There you go then, a whole column without talking about football.<br>Gave it a red hot go, didn't I?<br></font></p>
