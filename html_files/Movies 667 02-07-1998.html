            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE APOSTLE HHHHH<br>Hollywood heroes are generally so squeaky clean, so free of human frailty and failing (see Robert Redford's freshly laundered horse whisperer, for example) that Sonny Dewey, a Texan Pentecostal preacher who calls himself The Apostle, is a welcome relief. Played by Robert Duvall, who also wrote the screenplay and directs, Sonny is the kind of man who can whip an audience into a frenzy of religious fervour one moment and stalk his estranged wife (Farrah Fawcett) the next. When Sonny's evil ways are no longer tolerated he is forced to flee to a Louisiana backwater where he sets about the process of redemption, building a new church and trying to be a better man. But Sonny will always be Sonny. Duvall has never been better playing a bad man who wants desperately to be good, whether persuading his bedraggled flock to open their hearts to Jesus or romancing the world-weary radio station receptionist (Miranda Richardson). Even more impressive is Duvall's writing and direction, which is so bold, so deeply felt, so sympathetic to folk normally ridiculed by Hollywood that all we can do is fall to our knees and give praise for this small miracle of a movie. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>DR DOLITTLE HHH12<br>Forget the anal humour. Forget the shameless exploitation of cute children and talking animals with human characteristics. Because when you throw off those shackles, Dr Dolittle is funny and enjoyable. Eddie Murphy plays the uptight doctor of the title surprisingly straight, allowing the humour to bounce off him, rather than hamming it up as he sometimes does. And it works neatly in this very 90s updating of the tale. Murphy is a stressed-out medico who suddenly rediscovers his childhood talent of talking to and being understood by animals, who in turn talk back. These are modern animals with attitude, funny lines and big doses of cynicism, not all cute and fuzzy . . . especially the tiger with a chronic headache. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>GREASE<br>Twenty years on and Grease is still the word. So girls - drag out the bobbysocks and big skirts; boys - slick back your hair and throw on a leather jacket, for a trip back in time to the summer days and nights at Rydell High. Set in the late 50s, Grease united Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta as Sandy and Danny, a squeaky clean Australian holiday maker and an American greaser who have a summer fling. When Sandy's family stay in the US she ends up at Danny's high school, where her goody-two-shoes image certainly doesn't suit Danny's reputation as one of the macho T-Birds. While Grease is mostly fun and fluff, it does touch on issues of peer pressure and teen sex - in its own singing and dancing way. I'm yet to see this digitally remastered anniversary version but any scenes added back in certainly can't harm Grease's status as the biggest grossing movie musical of all time. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>SLAPPY AND THE STINKERS<br>Lifting plots from movies seems to be OK these days if one of the characters acknowledges it, as apparently happens in this Our Gang/Little Rascal-type kiddie-mischief adventure about five foolish but imaginative children who want to steal a flatulent sea lion named Slappy from the local aquarium and return it to the ocean. Before anyone can say, ?Hey, isn't that the plot of Free Willy? one of the kids rationalises that if the idea was good enough for the whale, it is good enough for the sea lion. Despite its unoriginality, one US critic noted that Slappy and the Stinkers, which follows the adventures of seven-year-olds enrolled in the summer enrichment program at the Dartmoor Academy, has ?a sunny look and a generally brisk pace?. The film's snot-nosed humour, including peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, whipped cream, slushy drinks and bird droppings in the face, as well as the destruction of the school carnival, should appeal to the contemporaries of the little stinkers. And, of course, there's the wind-breaking sea lion. Rated PG (not previewed)<br>WARRIORS OF VIRTUE<br>There's a clear division in this year's choice of holiday entertainment. While the hearts of young girls will be sent soaring by the romance of Anastasia, the boys, if they can get away from the computer games for a couple of hours, will no doubt be taken by Warriors of Virtue, an action-fantasy about a boy sent zooming to the planet Tao where he fights the evil Komodo for control of the Lifesprings. Of course, the journey is also spiritual and metaphorical. Ryan (Mario Yedida) is a wimp, the water boy for the football team, so his journey - initiated by Chinese chef-cum-Zen master Ming (he can land a ladle full of rice on a platter at 10 paces) - is to allow him to prove himself. While the director and stars are strictly no-name the set design is by Eurgenio Zanetti. He won an Oscar for Restoration and apparently manages to create a forest planet, with towering trees and everglades, not unlike the Yoda setting in The Empire Strikes Back. Even the mantra delivered by Ming to Ryan - "The answer lies within you? - has a definite Star Wars ring. Rated PG (not previewed)<br>SEVEN BEAUTIES<br>Lina Wertmuller is little talked about today but back in the 70s she was one of the biggest stars of European art cinema. Her masterpiece is widely regarded to be Seven Beauties (1975), which stars Giancarlo Giannini as a dandy who lives off seven adoring but rather plump sisters in fascist Italy. When one of the sisters is raped, Giannini's character murders the offender and mails pieces of the body all over Italy. Forced to join the army, he ends up on the Eastern Front. National Cinematheque is on each Saturday afternoon at the Cinema Paradiso. Phone 9227 1771 for times.<br>CANNES RETROSPECTIVE<br>The wonderful season of French classics to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Cannes Film Festival continues at the Cinema Paradiso over the weekend. On Saturday at 3pm is Bertrand Tavernier's A Sunday in the Country, about an old painter visited by his family before World War II, while Alain Cavalier's rarely seen Theresa, a visually stark study of the Carmelite nun known as The Little Flower of Jesus, is at 4.45pm. On Sunday at 2.30pm is Van Gogh, Maurice Pialat's spare, riveting portrait of the Dutch master. Andre Techine's My Favourite Season, starring French favourites Catherine Deneuve and Daniel Auteuil as a brother and sister who renew their childhood intimacy while facing their mother's death, is at 4.45pm. All films are on new 35mm prints. For details contact Cinema Paradiso on 9227 1771.<br></font></p>
