            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It almost goes without saying that the Internet, in particular the World Wide Web, is a resource of amazing depth and variety.<br>In the past fortnight, for example, it has been possible to be the most informed person on the planet about the future of the Spice Girls just by clicking on Yahoo's list of sites devoted to the group (see Web Sights, page 6).<br>People of a more serious disposition could have been equally as well informed about the nuclear tension between India and Pakistan by surfing to the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies site which has all the latest news on armouries in those angry neighbouring countries.<br>But just who is privy to this wonderful world of information, be it lightweight or serious?<br>The Australian Bureau of Statistics late last month released the results of its latest survey into Australian Net use. There are really no surprises.<br>The bureau found the biggest user group was aged 25 to 39; only 19 per cent of regular users were female; 56 per cent of all holders of a Bachelors degree had used it, as had nearly 50 per cent of all professionals.<br>In short: young, professional, adult and predominantly male. You could over-generalise and say this is the portion of the population that wants for little.<br>The Australian figures differ little from those revealed in surveys of US and European users, particularly those done by Georgia Tech in America.<br>The GVU studies, performed since 1994, show that female use of the Net is greater and growing in the US and Europe, but the Net-savvy population still fits the young, affluent male stereotype.<br>This disproportionate sharing of the new wealth of the information age does not just apply within countries.<br>International development experts at a recent conference on the Net and society at Harvard University warned that the medium was spreading unevenly around the globe. It had become highly developed in wealthier nations, but patchy elsewhere.<br>This could aggravate inequality between the world's rich and poor.<br>A common assumption, often heard from politicians and computer industry people, is that the Net will automatically lead to rising incomes and reduced inequality.<br>But, according to the experts at Harvard: ?Data from the World Bank show this isn't the case, neither globally between nations, nor nationally within countries. Even though IT is widely introduced into the global system, inequality is still high. The top 5 per cent are increasing their share of world wealth, and the bottom 5 per cent are losing their already small share.?<br>The experts equated access to the Net with access to land during the agricultural revolution and access to company shares during the industrial revolution.<br>All this poses difficult questions about what society, and governments in particular, should be doing to try to ensure a fairer share of the valuable resource of information. The WA Government's decision to add $100 million to spending on new technologies for State schools is not a bad start. Early and easy access to the Net would help ingrain more widespread use.<br>The American writer Douglas Rushkoff, in the most recent edition of the Guardian Online section, suggested that governments should not be interfering in the wildly competitive computer industry as the US was doing with its suit against Microsoft.<br>Instead it should be promoting the public interest. This could mean ensuring the availability of online public libraries, free terminals and open standards.<br>?Protecting the marketplace will not prove nearly as important - or popular - as promoting the values that competition doesn't address,? Rushkoff wrote.<br>?And that's what government is here for in the first place.?<br></font></p>
