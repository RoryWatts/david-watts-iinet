            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE newsgroup aus.censorship is a quiet little corner of cyberspace these days. A busy day now will see about 10 people posting their thoughts about governments intruding on free expression on the Net.<br>It was not always so. In April, May and June, hundreds of people joined online debates about censorship daily.<br>In those months Communications Minister Richard Alston was pushing his Net content regulation legislation; or if you want to call a spade a bloody shovel, his Net censorship plans.<br>The aus.censorship group was alive with outrage and denunciation. Most posters agreed with the more than 100 submissions to the Senate that said Senator Alston's laws could not work and could cost Australia a vital edge in information technology.<br>The senator stonewalled these objections and repeatedly cast aspersions on online critics such as those from aus.censorship. His mantra was that anyone against his laws was in favour of pornography, bomb recipes and paedophilia.<br>Nonsense, of course, but politically effective nonsense. The senator got his way and the online critics, after examining the futility of online democracy, got on with other things.<br>But the controversy remains and is being seized on by less predictable critics who have a ring of mainstream, offline respectability - the National Australia Bank, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler.<br>Last week in a report called Building a Stronger Information Economy for Australia, these firms attacked Senator Alston's censorship, due to come into effect on January 1.<br>?The approach taken is considered unworkable and places Australia out of step with the international community,? the report said.<br>It repeated a sentiment, often expressed in aus.censorship, that the Government's intention of protecting minors was appreciated.<br>B UT it said other approaches should be pursued, ones that made the family and not the Government the rightful guardians of children. Again it is a sentiment often expressed forcibly at aus.censorship.<br>?Our review indicates that, although the Government has implemented a wide-ranging program to develop Australia's information economy, improvements need to be made as a matter of urgency, if Australia is to develop as a strong high-tech centre outside the United States, as Israel has done,? said Arnold Bloch Leibler technology partner Michael Dodge.<br>Senator Alston's laws also came under renewed attack from a more predictable source.<br>Labor's communications spokesman Stephen Smith wants the Government to overhaul the legislation because it has failed to listen to industry concerns that it simply will not work and could cost the Australian Net industry not only money, but overseas custom.<br>Mr Smith latched on to the report by the three companies, saying it was significant that major Australian companies such as the NAB were now attacking the legislation.<br>The ball has been hit firmly back into the Government's court. It will be fascinating to see whether the senator can shrug off his latest critics as easily as the online community and their de facto spokesmen in aus.censorship.<br></font></p>
