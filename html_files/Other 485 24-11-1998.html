            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AWARDS<br>Australian Internet Awards Winners<br>www.webawards.info.au<br>THE people have spoken and the word they have said is ... Sausage.<br>Sausage Software was the publicly voted Most Popular Australian Web Site in this year's Financial Review-Telstra Australian Internet Awards.<br>More than 600 sites nominated for the awards.<br>As the public said Sausage, the official judges handed out awards to sites in 19 other categories, including games, sport, education, business, media and government.<br>Each winner is listed with a history of the awards and a hall of fame.<br>MAPS<br>Whereis<br>www.whereis.com.au/search.asp<br>FOR some reason, this companion to the White and Yellow Pages is a little unsatisfying, though still worth a look.<br>It is a Web street directory of the Australian capitals. Users key in an address and Whereis responds with a street map.<br>They can be hard to read and, at times, the results are only approximate. You may end up a map away from where you want to be, but the ability to zoom in and refocus maps is good.<br>REMEMBRANCE<br>Australian War Memorial<br>www.awm.gov.au<br>THE memorial was the deserved winner of the government section in the Australian Internet Awards. This simple and attractive site gives users the chance to search a haunting database - the honour roll of Australia's war dead.<br>The information for the Roll of Honour was compiled from card indices containing material transcribed directly from original records produced during or immediately after each conflict.<br>They detail the personal particulars, the unit, ship or establishment, and the date and circumstances of death of each person.<br>The memorial site also links to a database of its collections, details of how to order old films and pictures, and an education centre, among many well-thought-out features that make it a strong ?virtual? complement to the ?real? bricks and mortar memorial.<br>REFERENCE<br>Guinness Book of Records<br>www.guinnessrecords.com<br>THE ultimate guide to some of humanity's constant striving to be better ... or stranger ... is finally online. But you will need pretty good technology in your browser to appreciate it fully.<br>The site is a joy to look at, with responsive and noisy graphics - if you have the latest Macromedia Flash plug-in.<br>FUN<br>Bizarre Stuff You Can Make in Your Kitchen<br>freeweb.pdq.net/headstrong<br>WITH a title like Bizarre stuff You Can Make in Your Kitchen, there isn't much to add.<br>Experiments include: making sugar and saltpetre volcanoes, electric generators from lemons, rockets out of matchsticks, fake blood, strange goo and glowing pickles.<br></font></p>
