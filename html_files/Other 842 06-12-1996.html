            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DID we need the so-called great debate on television the other night? And if we did, why?<br>It is curious that when you put two clean-cut men such as Premier Richard Court and Opposition Leader Geoff Gallop in fresh suits, stand them on stage and point the cameras at them, they turn out to be ... politicians.<br>Not one gesture, one syllable or one facial expression told anything different.<br>What transpired was two grey men, two lots of question-avoidance and an hour of fidgety indifference for people who watched the debate on Channels 7 and 2.<br>The idea of the televised political debate is old. They have been happening on Australian TV for years, mostly on current affairs shows, and have produced more than a few donnybrooks.<br>But in recent years, the cult of personality has produced more debates between politicians and presenters than between politicians.<br>Richard Carleton, of 60 Minutes, George Negus, now of Foreign Correspondent, and Kerry O'Brien, of Lateline, are just some who like to inject themselves into proceedings.<br>The ?great debate? idea where two leaders thrash out issues under the civil eye of a moderator and, hopefully, under pressure from a panel of political journalists, is essentially American. US audiences like to see their presidential candidates give a full account of themselves this way.<br>In a country with 250 million people, 50 States and where television is far more pervasive and influential than here, it is an excellent forum.<br>But does WA need it?<br>We have 1.6 million people, very standard TV and, let's be honest, small-town politics.<br>The leadership of the free world is not up for grabs.<br>Both Mr Court and Dr Gallop would do far more by getting into the community and talking to people face-to-face.<br>Putting them on stage to answer questions is a good idea ... if it was not so obviously a stage-managed event.<br>The only element of fun in the whole affair came from Channel 9's Matt Price, who tried to pin the leaders down on drugs, asking whether either had tried them.<br>Price obviously was fishing for a ?I didn't inhale? line that made US President Bill Clinton the butt of so many jokes four years ago.<br>But, true to form, Mr Court and Dr Gallop, despite very worthy answers, were not conned into falling for that one.<br>Mr Court lost nothing by his appearance, judging from the polls run by Channel 7. But Dr Gallop has a lot of work to do. We knew that already.<br>The most significant factor was the number of people who said they were undecided about the leaders after the debate.<br>No one won anything. The impression left was of two fairly respectable, slightly wary politicians who are not TV performers.<br>Do we want them to be?<br></font></p>
