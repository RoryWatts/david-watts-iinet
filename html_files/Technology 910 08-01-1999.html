            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN A recent episode of Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia, the Scottish funnyman debagged himself to run naked around the Pinnacles north of Perth.<br>Later in the same show he bagged the Internet.<br>Connolly was musing away on Fraser Island, off Hervey Bay on the Queensland coast, about people's obsession with useless facts.<br>It was not a surprising muse, given that he had read that if you took all the sand from the island and dumped it on Sydney, it would be 200m deep . . . or something equally foolish.<br>Connolly wanted to know who found this sort of rubbish, who cared and wouldn't it be awful to sit next to them on a plane.<br>He also predicted that stuff like the amount of sand on Fraser Island (the world's biggest sand island) would be on the Net, ?that great anorak in the sky?.<br>And he is probably right. There is a lot of absolutely useless stuff on the Net.<br>There is also a little bit about Billy Connolly. Whether it is produced by the sort of raincoat-wearing obsessives he was musing about is impossible to say.<br>One of them, James McGowan, has done Connolly proud with a first-rate fan site. He has packed in a lot of the features expected by Web surfers when seeking celebrities: biography, frequently asked questions, lists of movies and songs as well as pictures.<br>The best thing Mr McGowan has done - and it is a rare useful use of the technology - is to write a JacaScript joke generator.<br>This means when you want to submerge yourself in Connolly's raw humour, you open a link at which his jokes roll across the screen at a speed you can adjust.<br>A less resourceful, but still reasonable, Web homage to the Big Yin is Billy Connolly: God or What.<br>Compared with Mr McGowan's fairly professional effort, this looks to be a basic, home-built site whose aim is to share an appreciation of Connolly, rather than look for site of the month awards.<br>It still has plenty going for it though. God or What has an online quiz at a link called Billy's Hair. This page shows several pictures of Connolly at different stages in his career with his wildly different hair and beard styles. The quiz simply asks surfers which they prefer.<br>Both Mr McGowan's fan site and God or What - even though they are labours of love by cyber-amateurs - have much more to recommend them than what appears to be the official Billy Connolly home page. It looks great. It is powered by clever animation using Macromedia Flash. But it contains little compared with the other two. Its main purpose is to show schedules of tour dates and to point the way to Connolly merchandise.<br>Apart from these three sites there appear to be no general Connolly pages. However, there are a lot that mention him in passing.<br>A simple search using a reputable engine like HotBot or Excite will reveal mentions of Connolly movie appearances, videos for sale, tape recordings etc.<br>Links:<br>Billy Connolly fan page:<br>www.sarsen.demon.co.uk/billy/billy.html Billy Connolly, God or What:<br>freespace.virgin.net/martin.lewis/billy/<br>Official page:<br>www.tickety-boo.com/billy/index.htm<br>Billy Connolly Anecdote: www.ma.man.ac.uk/ ~simon/edinburgh/con<br>nolly_anecdote.html<br></font></p>
