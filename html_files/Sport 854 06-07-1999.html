            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS year's Wimbledon has left a long list of people to feel for.<br>Andre Agassi for meeting Pete Sampras in the final. As Agassi put it: ?I ran into a buzzsaw ... I had some chances but there was simply nothing I could do to stop him.?<br>Patrick Rafter for running into Agassi in the semi-final.<br>Mark Philippoussis for injuring his knee when he appeared to be having the best of Sampras in their quarter final.<br>Steffi Graf for not being able to wave farewell to the centre court crowd.<br>Boris Becker for being able to do so, but only after Rafter gave him a bath.<br>Jelena Dokic for coming from nowhere to the quarter finals and having to put up with the intrusions into her non-tennis life by the British tabloid press.<br>Alexandra Stevenson for also coming from nowhere to the semis and having to put up with her mother.<br>It is tempting to add Perth's Channel 9 to that list.<br>Nine persists in showing delayed telecasts, occasionally treating viewers to rain delays that are two hours old.<br>Armchair fans hate it when broadcasters hold the rights to a major sport but do not show it live.<br>The Internet and Foxtel allowed some tennis fans to know that Rafter had overwhelmed Becker last Wednesday well before Nine showed the match.<br>Nine's program manager, Ric Bryndzej, admitted yesterday that the inclusion of live or delayed sport in prime-time schedules played havoc with ratings and alienated many viewers who were forced to miss their regular programs.<br>He agreed that a dedicated sports channel would be the answer to his and sports lovers' prayers.<br>The best chance of this would come with digital television but the Federal Government does not plan to allow commercial stations to offer multi-channel broadcasting.<br>The bottom line to that is the present set-up is likely to continue, only with better quality pictures of rain.<br>Mr Bryndzej also pointed out that Wimbledon was once a sure winner for Nine. It was shown live and restaurants in Perth closed early because people stayed at home to watch the tennis.<br>?Since then the omission of top-ranked Aussie players and the general disenchantment displayed to tennis brats worldwide has changed the way people view tennis, not just in Perth but around Australia and indeed worldwide,? he said.<br>?Viewer interest declined to the point that it was unviable to sustain the telecast in prime-time.?<br>Ratings for the first week of the tournament were dreadful. But more wins for Dokic, Rafter and Philippoussis lifted viewer interest,<br>Nine shuffled its line-up to take advantage. Even John Farnham made way on Thursday, relinquishing the timeslot pinched from the Footy Show.<br>And of course it rained.<br>Wimbledon, page 60<br></font></p>
