            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Go Now (M)<br>Robert Carlyle, Juliet Aubrey<br>Directed by Michael Winterbottom<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>ESCAPISTS should look elsewhere for their cinematic thrills. Go Now is confrontational, gritty and a very dark comedy about multiple sclerosis.<br>The film was made for television by the BBC and this shows in its close-cropped scenes and its brevity. But its story and the acting of a good young cast are pure big screen stuff.<br>Go Now continues the fine British tradition of calling a spade a bloody shovel, never shirking the issues that real life will always throw at us unsuspecting pawns. Think of Priest, Secrets and Lies - and even of Trainspotting, one of this year's biggest hits. All grip the jugular and say: ?This is what it's like, pal.?<br>It certainly is as far away from Hollywood and tinsel-wrapped, star-draped films like The First Wives Club, as Braveheart was from Babe.<br>Adding to the realism is the fact that the script is by an MS sufferer, Paul Henry Powell, who conceived the idea while looking for something to do when his physical disabilities took away his capacity to play sport.<br>Not surprisingly, given the writer's sporting passion, Go Now is centred on a scruffy suburban soccer team and its best player, Nick Cameron (the adaptable Robert Carlyle from Trainspotting).<br>The team and his mates who play for it are Nick's main reason for being until he meets the gorgeous Karen (BAFTA award-winning actress Juliet Aubrey of Middlemarch fame making her feature debut) at a nightclub.<br>They fall gently in love and move in together. All this takes the first half hour of an 87-minute film and is done slowly and deliberately as if to stress the normality of this couple. In many ways it is very European in flavour - not a lot appears to happen, but the characters grow on the viewer.<br>Gentle rain falls, piano duets are played and the camera lingers on long love-making sessions where both partners are finding pleasure in each other.<br>No hint of drama until Nick drops a hammer at work because of a numb hand. Then in a slightly surreal scene he has a severe episode of double vision while looking at a butcher carrying a bloodied carcass through a street market.<br>Medical tests and frustration follow. Karen goes to the library and her research into Nick's symptoms show he may have MS. She confronts doctors, but no one tells Nick.<br>It is not until Nick has had a car accident (because his numb leg won't press the brake pedal) and he is starting to walk like a hunchback that he discovers a book on MS hidden by Karen ... and the shocking truth dawns.<br>What follows is a gut-wrenching portrayal of a man whose life has just fallen on its backside. The first three stages of grief - denial, anger and depression - are brought to the screen with clear ferocity and force by Carlyle's Nick.<br>Karen becomes a rock, showing true love. But she has doubts too.<br>All this may sound sad and tragic. It is of course. But real life has humour and this is allowed to leaven the tragedy in best straight-shooting British style.<br>A distraught Nick, trying to play pool at the pub with his mates but unable to hit straight, demands they stop patronising him and give him a ?bit of stick?.<br>Pretty soon best friend Tony tells Nick: ?You're ugly, you're skint and you're a four-eyed spaz?. There is little room for insincerity in a line like that.<br>There is pathos, too. Nick's baffled and bewildered parents become legless on a visit to the pub with him. After, his dad wanders drunkenly into Nick and Karen's bedroom and tells his son: ?Walk to me son. Just throw away those damn sticks and walk to me.?<br>Unfortunately with these gems of ideas and scenes building, plus a heart-rending confrontation between Karen and Nick, Go Now ends about 20 minutes too soon. It fails to really come to grips with the totality of change that this illness brings to its sufferer and his circle.<br></font></p>
