            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Hundreds of people have used the World Wide Web to apologise to the ?stolen generation? of Aborigines forcefully separated from their parents.<br>The Apology Australia site, brainchild of Perth man Anthony Shipley, was set up in early June to invite people to list their names under an apology to Aborigines.<br>Mr Shipley set up the site because he was frustrated with Prime Minister John Howard's muted personal apology and the fact that the Federal Government did not make a formal apology in the wake of deprivations spelt out by Aborigines who had been torn from their families for the sake of assimilation.<br>Surfers simply leave their name, e-mail address and postcode at the site. A list of surnames and the State of origin can then be displayed to show who has lodged an apology.<br>Mr Shipley's early analysis of the apologies showed that about 80 per cent were from university domains. ?I think this is a good sign for the future, although it might also mean that they have better access to the Internet and/or the publicity has spread better there,? he said.<br>Most postings were from WA. Mr Shipley felt he needed to promote the site more to the eastern States. The contentious issue of an apology created early flak when Mr Shipley first announced the site in the iinet.general newsgroup.<br>For example, one poster wrote: ?I have nothing to apologise for and I am sick to the core of this idiotic demand. Had I been in government in Australia at that time, I hope I should have had the same good ideas and would point blank refuse to apologise.?<br>But Mr Shipley says he has received far less abusive e-mail than he expected.Apology Australia was recently added to the list of sites at the Matilda search engine's Good Causes page.<br>HELP DESK<br>Apology Australia<br>apology.west.net.au<br>Matilda Good Causes<br>www.aaa.com.au/<br>matilda/causes<br></font></p>
