            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WEST COAST full forward Scott Cummings had one win in the western derby. He appears to be the only pundit who tipped a Fremantle victory.<br>Of course Cummings was only joking. His tip is on record at The Footy Show's Internet site along with those of fellow panellists from last Thursday's Burswood show, Allen Jakovich and Billy Brownless.<br>Football fans who can remember that far back - before the world turned upside down - will recall that Cummings was very funny as he read out the Eagles list and pronounced half the side unfit or out of form.<br>Is this man a prophet? Was it insider trading? No, he was just playing the fool and entertaining viewers.<br>Who would be a football tipster for a living? Such a person would need every bit of Cummings' considerable good humour to pronounce with certainty, week after week, the eight AFL winners.<br>This is particularly so with a team such as Fremantle on the loose.<br>Way, way back in the dim mists of time - two Sundays ago - the Dockers were the Shockers as they stumbled and fumbled their way to an embarrassing loss against a below-par Essendon.<br>Even Channel Seven commentators Dennis Cometti and Kevin Bartlett, who normally do their utmost to bring tension and drama to awful contests, gave up the pretence before half-time, declaring it a shocker.<br>And now the Dockers, with tough physical presence, brilliant one-touch skills and pace, are the toast of the town. Well, about half the town anyway.<br>And the Eagles, who yawned their way to a lazy six-goal win over Melbourne when Fremantle went belly up - are the ones numbed, dumbstruck, tired, hurt, out of form, and maybe out of fashion.<br>On the second part of Basil's Footy Show on Sunday, Brad Hardie asked if the Eagles would now stop strutting around town like peacocks.<br>In a show not noted for sensitivity, Hardie's question may have seemed especially insensitive. But it is one worth following because it is how many Fremantle followers perceive Eagles supporters.<br>WA was the only place where the derby was televised but the shock result spread quickly.<br>Up in Brisbane, supporters of the Lions are licking their lips as they await West Coast.<br>At the club's Internet site yesterday was this suggestion for the Brisbane banner for next Sunday's game: ?Eagles, from third to fifth will the be the state of play, As the Lions clip your wings today.?<br>Who will the experts tip? Allowing for recent form, analysing all results, judging by momentum, taking into account players' body language, you would have to say Brisbane.<br>And Fremantle would be a certainty over Port Adelaide on Saturday night.<br>But as the western derby has taught us - the only certainty in football is that nothing is certain.<br>Or we could just ask Scott Cummings.<br></font></p>
