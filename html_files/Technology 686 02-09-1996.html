            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT MAKES Melrose Place look like Bananas in Pyjamas. The characters live in a comic strip world seething with intrigue, threatened with other-worldly forebodings and they are nearly all up to their necks in fleshy affairs.<br>?It? is the work of a collective of Curtin University students who are pushing new technology as hard as they can to see what sort of art emerges.<br>At the moment their energies are concentrating on a steamy multimedia series called hOUSE@ (correct) which is playing on a computer screen near you.<br>For the past 10 weeks hOUSE@ has been bubbling along, its plot thickening and the images becoming more outrageous and finely tuned.<br>Publicist for the Curtin group, Sian Binder, says hOUSE@ is really the first Australian Internet soap opera.<br>She disputes the claim by US software giant Microsoft that it had the first Net soap when it launched a turgid TV-like romp called Friday's Beach at its Australian site last week.<br>The media hype - and The West Australian admittedly was caught by it - inflamed the Curtin students, who at that time had spent more than eight weeks putting to air their own soap, especially designed for new media.<br>Ms Binder claims more than 15,000 Net users have seen the soap already.<br>She said this week that TechTalk, the Sydney-based producers of Friday's Beach, had been e-mailed immediately the claims started about their ?first soap on the Internet.?<br>She said TechTalk took six days to reply, saying they would look at hOUSE@ before replying further.<br>The hOUSE@ team's main gripe, apart from what they say is Friday's Beach false claim, is that the Sydney-set soap does nothing more than echo TV soaps, adding only a few of the possible enhancements available through multimedia.<br>And the Curtin crew is challenging the very idea that television will be the main entertainment vehicle of the future.<br>hOUSE@ is the students' leadup showcase for a bigger event ... the hOUSE@ gallery and exhibition in October, part of the Artrage 96 festival.<br>Ms Binder said hOUSE@ would celebrate cyber-art and cyber-artists throughout Australia.<br>Internationally renowned new media artist Stelarc would make his first Australian appearance at the celebrations for hOUSE@.<br>The Perth Cyber Theatre dance group would perform, projecting its work via satellite-computer hook-ups around the Net.<br>And there would even be more conventional fare - such as live music.<br>The hOUSE@ Internet soap is not just making waves on the Net.<br>Community radio 6NR broadcasts the latest episode each Tuesday.<br>The format of the soap - on the Net at least - is like no other serial drama doing the rounds at the moment.<br>For a start it is not filmed and there are no scripts on paper.<br>The main characters are all friends of the creators and backroom-workers at hOUSE@.<br>Ms Binder said the ?stars? were filmed on video before the soap got off the ground.<br>They went through simple motions such as walking, then went on their merry ways.<br>Their images, however, were transferred to computer, where for the past 10 weeks they have undergone massive operations such as projecting characters into a virtual reality world beyond the animated street scenes they inhabit normally.<br>It has also involved some computerised cutting and pasting of other bodies on to the ?stars? so they can perform the mostly hilarious bedroom scenes of the plot.<br>The result is an addictive little pot-boiler which never fails to amuse and has the soap's main ingredient ... suspense: you've just got to see the next one.<br>The five scriptwriters - Ms Binder, Kathy Barber, Ben Steele, Nick King and Sam Collins - thrive on late nights, coffee and a sense of the absurd.<br>Not to mention a healthy addiction for the real Melrose Place for a couple of the writers.<br>The five writers, plus Alex Yapp, create the artwork and make the new technology work in each episode.<br>The combined energies of these people from film and television, fine art, electronic computer engineering and computer science disciplines is scheduled to run for another six episodes.<br>Then their work will go on CD-ROM as another contribution to Artrage.<br>Other budding cyber-artists are also being given a chance to have their new media work included on the CD.<br>They can submit details at the hOUSE@ World Wide Web site on the Internet.<br>Web address:<br>http://house.curtin.edu.au/<br></font></p>
