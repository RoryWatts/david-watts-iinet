            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DREW BANFIELD'S handsome, dark visage was focused intently on Carlton's Craig Bradley. Every sinew strained as they waited on the edge of the centre square for the bounce to start the second half.<br>Then the well-proportioned rude girl, wearing nothing but a G-string and smile, tried to kiss Banfield. He wasn't having any. This was a final for goodness sake and there was no time for poofy girl-kissing.<br>If you watched the Eagles brilliant demolition of Carlton on TV you missed this entertaining sideshow. Three girls - I would hazard a guess they were not school teachers - streaked on the field and even when they were led off kept the crowd enthralled with some interesting gyrations.<br>Television does not show this sort of stuff when it broadcasts football. This is family viewing.<br>That is why we see every millilitre of blood that forces players off. And that is why amateur lip readers have to shield their eyes at replays of near-misses for goal.<br>What a weekend for a football fanatic. It was possible to avoid nearly all domesticity or work from Friday night to late yesterday afternoon.<br>To prove this I kept a small diary.<br>Friday 8.30pm: Watch ABC's The Final Cut (well, football does have to wait for some things).<br>9.30pm: Second half of Brisbane-Essendon game, one of the most thrilling ever.<br>Saturday morning: Read the football news from 9am-1pm. Go to Subiaco Oval. Come home like a cat that swallowed the cream. Eagles are brilliant, Blues lack manpower. Koutoufides cannot do it by himself. McIntosh, McKenna, Kemp and Cousins can lift a team.<br>4.45pm: Watch replay to see close-ups of McIntosh taking Kernahan out of the game.<br>7.45pm: Out for dinner.<br>9pm: Hostess's tone rather abrupt when she says: ?Turn that @#**& TV off and come to dinner please. It's ruined.? Over blueberry pie watch Daryn Cresswell's last-minute mark to finish off the game Hawks. Sydney has character but, without Lockett, look vulnerable.<br>Sunday 9am-noon: Read football news, watch Rex Hunt's band of merry men.<br>12.30pm-3pm: Geelong is dishevelled, disenchanted, disappointing and a disgrace. At least they won't be around to cave in again at the grand final.<br></font></p>
