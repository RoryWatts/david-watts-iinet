            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time ... and now you can fool Netscape or Mosaic whenever you want to.<br>HotDog is a hypertext markup language (HTML) editor which lets Web surfers view their creations offline.<br>They no longer have to log on to view their efforts at making Web pages.<br>The time-consuming task, which could mean dollars to Web editors honing their wares on user-pays connections to Internet access providers, has been streamlined and simplified.<br>At the heart of HotDog is a small 5k file called mozock.dll which, when copied into the windows/system directory as winsock.dll, makes HotDog believe it is connected to the Net, thus allowing users to activate their browser.<br>This ability to cheat winsock.dll is a small but vital feature of HotDog.<br>This HotDog comes in standard and professional flavours - a bit like the difference between regular and low-alcohol beers.<br>It is very Windows friendly with, if the users chooses, easy to follow tutorials on HTML, and graphic toolbars to make editing easy.<br>Sausage Software say they are working on releases for Macintosh and Unix users as well.<br>HotDog users who know only the basics of HTML will find after a few sessions they can confidently place tables, images, bold and italic text and rules with ease. The program allows users to place the cursor at an insertion point, click on a graphic toolbar item and fill in easy dialogue boxes to create hypertext links.<br>HotDog Pro can be downloaded from iiNet Technologies in Perth for a 30-day trial.<br>Sausage Software, through its Australian file transfer protocol (FTP) site in Melbourne, has all the news on HotDog, plus the all important mozock.dll needed to fool Netscape or Mosaic.<br>Go to the Best of the Best link at www.iinet.net.au to download trial copies of HotDog Pro. www.sausage.com.au has all the information, copies of HotDog Standard and Pro, plus auxiliary files.<br>???<br>ALSO available for download at iiNet is the newsreader program, Free Agent by Forte.<br>Like HotDog this allows users to work offline, this time in Newsgroups and outgoing mail.<br>Packed with features, Free Agent looks likely to replace WinVN as a defacto newsreader standard.<br>It is capable of multi-tasking, so you decode and display graphic downloads while reading other newsgroup items, or composing and sending mail.<br></font></p>
