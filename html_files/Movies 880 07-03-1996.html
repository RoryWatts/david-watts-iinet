            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Three Wishes<br>Patrick Swayze, Mary<br>Elizabeth Mastrantonio<br>Directed by Martha Coolidge<br>THE three wishes I take into any film starring Patrick Swayze are simple enough: that it's not a lemon, turkey or lame duck. His latest - surprise, surprise - is none of these.<br>While it will probably be out of the cinema in a flash, it is rather pleasant family entertainment.<br>Just why director Martha Coolidge lets a good idea drift aimlessly for 115 minutes before a guaranteed happy ending is a mystery.<br>She has good raw material to work with.<br>The story of a liberated 1950s single mum taking in a beatnik, jobless drifter whom she accidentally hits with her wood-panelled station wagon has lots of possibilities.<br>The drifter, Jack, played in silence and with lots of attempted meaningful looks by Swayze, changes the lives of all he meets.<br>Not least changed are the mum, Jeanne, played by the sexiest Maid Marian of them all, Mastrantonio, and her sons Tom (Joseph Mazello) and Gunny (Seth Mumy, son of Lost in Space's Billy Mumy).<br>They have lost their husband and dad in the Korean War and yearn for a normal life in 1955 outer suburbia.<br>Normal means a dad who plays baseball, goes hunting and fishing and smokes Camels. And a mum who wears frocks, hats and gloves and cooks ?neat? things.<br>But Jack does not offer that. He offers philosophy, Zen style and an apparently magical dog called Genie, who just might be into granting wishes.<br>As Jack recuperates at Jeanne's home it becomes apparent she is no typical suburban girl. Her eyes burn with passion and her body language signals amazing sexual tension for a family movie.<br>Tom just wants normality and latches on to Jack as a surrogate dad. It goes well even with Jack leading the mini-league baseballers in Buddhist chanting before games.<br>The quest for acceptance against the quest for independent thinking provides the dramatic tension.<br>All else appears to be abandoned, especially the development of minor characters, who come out of Three Wishes as cruel, heartless and non-thinking products of suburban ordinariness.<br>Overall, it is a poor man's Edward Scissorhands with little magic, few light moments but with a strong message (Jack's motto): Be happy with what you've got.<br></font></p>
