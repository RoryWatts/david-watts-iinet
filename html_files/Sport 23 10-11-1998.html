            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">UNFORGETTABLE sporting sights dotted television screens at the weekend.<br>Top of the list was probably Might and Power's effortless, seven-length win in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes, shown on Saturday by Channel 10.<br>Shane Warne ran a close second. Nine showed his return to State cricket in the Victoria-NSW one-dayer on Sunday.<br>The crowd was small, but at the risk of being sacrilegious, Warne's lusty batting and good-as-ever bowling appeared to feed the 5000.<br>Up there too was Ten's snappy coverage of Rally Australia.<br>Just as unforgettable was the sight of Merv Hughes' gut wobbling as he ran into bowl for Canberra against Queensland on Saturday.<br>His body may have seen better days, but his line and length have held up well, as has his aggression.<br>Hughes shouldered Bulls batsman Martin Love who had had the temerity to cart him around the Gabba.<br>The body contact right in front of umpire Glen Zimmer earned tut-tuts from commentator Ian Chappell, but, according to AAP, ended with a few jokes between the protagonists in the dressing room after the match.<br>Queensland won easily. But did it really matter? This was a mismatch that really did not deserve TV time.<br>An overweight Hughes being ?colourful? in front of about 4000 people in a little one-dayer is not really cricket.<br>The shame is that the majority of cricket lovers in Western Australia have to put up with this sort of charred offering on free-to-air TV.<br>Real cricket, at least until the first Test in Brisbane in 10 days, is almost entirely the preserve of pay-TV now.<br>According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released last week, about five per cent of people in this State have signed up. The lack of action in rolling out new cable means that that figure will stay low for some time. There is also no choice for subscribers. It's Foxtel or nothing. Over east they have Optus Vision as well.<br>And Optus Vision just happens to have a channel devoted to cricket.<br>Optus covered South Australia's humiliation of England on Saturday, and yet another free-flowing Greg Blewett century against our Ashes opponents on Sunday.<br>It also had Matthew Elliott's twin centuries for Victoria in the shield match against NSW.<br>Because of the complexities of sporting rights, Foxtel had Australia's triumph over Pakistan in the one-dayers.<br>These wins featured Darren Lehmann's century in Karachi, the match-winning bowling of Brendon Julian in Peshawar, the utter professionalism of Ricky Ponting and Michael Bevan, surprisingly bad Australian catching, and, saddest to say, commentary by Geoff Boycott.<br>The WA cricket lover was deprived of most of this.<br>It is like having only a few pieces of a very big jigsaw. And one of those pieces - the one with Hughes' stomach - does not even fit now.<br></font></p>
