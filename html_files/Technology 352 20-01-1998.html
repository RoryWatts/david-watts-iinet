            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Opera Web browser offers a slimline, nimble alternative to the two heavyweights.<br>Norway will undoubtedly win gold medals at the Winter Olympics next month. If there was a browser Olympics. the little country - well a little company in the little country at least - would have to settle for bronze. But what an achievement.The little company is called Opera Software and operates from the town of Kjeller. It employs just 11 people and has decided to tackle the browser heavyweights Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>In a downhill ski race in the theoretical browser games, Netscape would be resting in front of the fire with a glass of Schnapps and a nervous look over its shoulder as MSIE gathered speed to cut through the finishing gates. Little Opera would be just leaving the starting gates, full of optimism and talent. The others would have packed their skis and gone home.Latest figures from the Browserwatch site that registers hits at its pages by browser make support the ski race analogy. Netscape had 58.1 per cent of hits (or 8637) last Wednesday, MSIE had 31.3 per cent and third was Opera with 2.16 per cent.<br>If Access could be so bold, this figure should grow considerably over the next few months. It will not threaten the big boys because it has neither marketing hype nor PC dealer influence.<br>And it faces potential user resistance to registration and payment of about $50 after 30 days. The program will not work after that without it. But it is an exciting product worth a look by those who value fast and light programs.<br>Opera's biggest first impression is its size. It is tiny. In browser terms it is a featherweight, occupying just 1.9 Mb after installation. Netscape's leanest browser is more than 8Mb and a full installation of MSIE can hog 40Mb.<br>Kynn Bartlett, president of the HTML Writers' Guild, told HotWired after the new version 3.0 was released earlier this month that Opera was the best browser on the market.<br>?It's everything the Web was meant to be - fast, sleek, clean, powerful, and yet easy to use,? he said. ?Shame on Netscape and Microsoft for being shown up by a tiny company that knows more about browser design than the giants.?<br>Not only is Opera easy on disk space, it needs very little computing power to run. Its makers claim it will perform on old systems such as 386SXs with 6Mb of memory. The performance on today's average PC - a Pentium with at least 16Mb - is very impressive.<br>Access found Opera came to screen twice as fast as MSIE, which, in turn, was twice as fast as Netscape. In two weeks of near constant use - feeling no need to use the other, more familiar browsers - it regularly loaded pages faster than the big two.Opera supports many of the latest HTML standards but users who want style sheets and layers will have to wait for version 4.0, expected in mid-year. Java Script is supported, but not Java.This is not a big handicap because a lot of Java just slows down pages rather than enhancing them. The ability to scale a page from 20 per cent to 1000 per cent while viewing it is an impressive feature. It is like changing desktop resolution but with more choices and far fewer glitches.Also impressive is the ability to display numerous pages in new windows all within the one big Opera window.Navigation by keyboard rather than mouse is easy, making it more accessible for people with disabilities.<br>Users can choose what mail and news programs to run with Opera ? just like the old days. And the program will import your bookmarks or favorites automatically from your default browser and include them with its wide variety of URLs in its Hot List.<br>The Hot List can be displayed in an easily toggled pane to the left of the main window and cache and history are easily and quickly displayed too.Opera is available for Windows users only, but other platforms will be supported within months. In fact, a recent survey at the Opera site showed that 1600 users offered to pre-pay for Mac and OS/2 versions.The company's Web site is full of quirky slogans such as ?Opera: Where more is less and less is more? and ?Our marvellous browser - so many features, so little code?.<br>But users have been just as gushing with their praise in the company's guest book.<br>?Who could guess that you could actually browse the Web on a lowly 386 and enjoy it!?? wrote one user.<br>BULLETIN BOARD<br>Electronic Document and Records Management<br>Date: March 9-10.
