            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONLINE SHOPPING<br>Rottnest General Store<br>www.rottnestgeneralstore.com.au<br>THIS site is bang on time for the annual summer exodus to Rottnest Island. It allows Web users to order groceries and liquor ahead of their holiday and have them waiting on arrival.<br>Users simply browse the site's shelves which emulate those at the store, and click on goods they will need. These are added to a snazzy virtual shopping trolley which keeps an updated tally of how much is spent.<br>At the check-out, users enter credit card and accommodation details and arrival time.<br>Ryan Tabbara, of the designers Australian Internet Pages, said order details were received on the island store's computer and printed out.<br>?When you arrive on the island the order will have already been delivered to your doorstep on the day of arrival and even the cold items placed in the fridge,? he said.<br>YAHOO SHOPPING AUSTRALIA<br>au.shopping.yahoo.com<br>ALSO bang on time for Christmas is Yahoo's Australian shopping site. It is a portal for 25 well-known Australian shops, including Dick Smith, Tandy and the Body Shop.<br>Searching the database for gifts is fast and powerful.<br>Lists of the wanted goods plus the online stores where they are available are returned quickly.<br>It is then a simple matter of producing credit card details and delivery requirements . .. no need to join the main street crowds at all.<br>BUBBLEBOY VIRUS<br>THIS worm reared its ugly head last week but is more annoying than deadly with its ability to send its infection by e-mail to everyone in a user's address book.<br>It is confined to Microsoft Internet Explorer and Outlook programs running under Windows 95 or 98.<br>Its ability to activate from the preview pane of Outlook Express's e-mail client is sending shudders through the Web community.<br>Many sites have been set up to deal with Bubbleboy. These are a small few:<br>www.datafellows.com/v-descs/bubb-boy.htm<br>Data Fellows has an in-depth explanation of how Bubbleboy operates and includes screen shots that show what to expect.<br>www.microsoft.com/security/Bulletins/<br>ms99-032.asp<br>Microsoft has a variety of links at this page to patches and fixes which will guard against the worm. MS products are the only ones affected so far, but they account for a good deal of the Web population.<br></font></p>
