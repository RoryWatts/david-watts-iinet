            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GOLF is cruel to humans, so much so that there is almost a case for banning it from the airwaves.<br>Boxing is sheer brutality, as is American football. Wrestling is a bit of a joke in its televised professional guise, Irish hurling is dangerous, and synchronised swimming can damage the brain cells.<br>But in golf there is nowhere to hide. All your stupidity, hot-headedness, frailty and lack of form are in the open.<br>Make a mistake and the camera will not back off.<br>The commentators will pull your swing, your fitness and even your state of mind to pieces.<br>And what a field day the expert commentators and the armchair golfers had yesterday while watching the absorbing final day of the Greg Norman Holden Classic from tricky Royal Melbourne.<br>For a start it rained buckets in the best Melbourne summer tradition.<br>And in the best Melbourne sporting tradition, the crowd still came, popping up umbrellas in a way that would have Subiaco Oval officials in a tizz.<br>Rather than hinder the game as a spectacle, the rain turned it into a great test of character.<br>Forget the beauty of long, hard hitting with favourable bounces on smooth fairways and greens.<br>The Norman Classic field had to contend with soaking greens, muddy traps and dripping trousers.<br>Only the caddies seemed to get off relatively easy. They had the big umbrellas.<br>Players, cameramen, galleries and assorted hangers-on simply got soaked.<br>The rain enhanced the character battle and also helped contribute to a thrilling finish between Queenslanders Norman and the chunky Peter Senior.<br>Senior, less attractive than Norman but very effective, held the lead all day and played it safe to the end to ward off Norman's challenge.<br>The Shark had two good chances to draw even with holeable putts on the 17th and 18th, but even this champion could not overcome the atrocious playing conditions.<br>The trouble with TV is that it does not show how bad the weather really is. And yesterday it looked pretty bad on the box, so you can bet it was twice as awful in reality.<br>So it was left for Senior, with a one-stroke lead and the 18th to play, to lose ... and the man is a terrier.<br>Even the rain stopped and the wind dropped as Senior came home in regulation, chided over-eager photographers lining him up as he prepared for the crucial putt, and finally went off more relieved than rejoicing over his good win.<br>The coverage by Channel Seven was added to by overhead shots from the same airship that added a new dimension to the Melbourne Cup carnival.<br>By comparison the second Test from the SCG seemed sleepy, even though it provided plenty of tension.<br>The weather has been kind in Sydney, but unlike Melbourne the people seem to be staying away.<br>Early this morning rugby fans got their last chance to see the great David Campese play a Test for the Wallabies.<br>But again Seven's coverage was far too late. The game started at 11pm, WA time, but did not go to air until 12.20am.<br></font></p>
