            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Microsoft and Netscape may be pushing the boundaries of Web technology but it's not necessarily making life easier for Web authors and surfers.<br>Microsoft and Netscape have been condemned for following independent paths in their Web browser packages - Internet Explorer 4.0 and Communicator. Computer experts at the US Web giant cnet handed both companies' browsers scathing reports in the annual end-of-year review of best computing products.<br>?Both browsers have opened up new standards that will let Web developers create incredible interactive content but, unfortunately, these standards are often incompatible,? cnet said.<br>?For instance, a page that scores major eye-candy points by using dynamic HTML in IE 4.0 usually won't work in Navigator 4.0, and vice versa. Nor will a push channel designed for one browser work as well - if at all - in the other.?<br>The review admitted both products were excellent pieces of software in themselves. But they had succeeded in ?fracturing the Web wider than ever before?.<br>?And with both sides claiming to be the good guys, it appears we won't see a comprehensive, cross-browser, interactive-content standard anytime soon.<br>?Microsoft and Netscape can't even agree on which version of Java to use. As a result, most of the dynamic HTML you'll see in the coming months will be on sites that have sold their souls to one company or the other - or on those rare sites that can afford to develop for both browsers simultaneously,? cnet said.?Neither company deserves an award from anyone, and certainly not from cnet.?<br>The browser war erupted fully in October after months of skirmishing when MS and Netscape released preview releases of software that did much more than browse the Web.<br>Netscape Communicator bundled e-mail, news, chat, telephony and HTML editing. MSIE went further by enabling a Windows95 or NT operating system to be viewed as if it was part of the Web.<br>Microsoft has improved between 10 and 15 percentage points in its share of the browser market, according to several surveys. Netscape has dropped by that amount but still leads the way with nearly 60 per cent .<br>Some new HTML editing software released toward the end of the year acknowledges the different standards being pursued by the browser giants.Macromedia Dreamweaver, rated by Access as a blockbuster program of the future, enables HTML editors to write slightly different versions of dynamic HTML - principally style sheets and layers - for several different versions of browser.<br>The Hotwired Webmonkey pages on the Web echoed cnet's criticisms of the browsers. HTML commentator Paul Boutin compiled a Browser Wish List last month which lamented the divergence in channel push technology and Java scripting in particular.<br>Mr Boutin was especially harsh on Microsoft for constantly developing bigger and more complicated applications that would run properly only on the newest Pcs.<br></font></p>
