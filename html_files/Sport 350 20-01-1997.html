            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TOO much tennis was almost too much ... until yesterday. The Australian Open in Melbourne was turned on its head by the demolition of four women's seeds in extreme heat.<br>What an odd day Channel Seven was able to bring viewers in its blanket coverage. With weird symmetry out went the No.1 (Steffi Graf), No.3 (Conchita Martinez), No.5 (Anke Huber) and No.7 (Lindsay Davenport).<br>As chirpy commentator Pam Shriver observed, upsets can be contagious, though neither she nor any of the other army of commentators had seen a day of upsets on this scale at a Grand Slam.<br>Shriver and Wendy Turnbull also were concerned that Graf and her victor Amanda Coetzer went heads bared in the 45C centre court heat. Graf was visibly stressed after the match and the Seven team talked incessantly about her.<br>Meanwhile, the cameras were on Coetzer who was shaking all over, possibly from the emotion of beating the German champion, but just as likely from the exertion. No one thought to comment on how the heat had affected her.<br>Up to yesterday much of the open had been tame. It was rare to see a match as good as the one on day one in which Spaniard Carlos Moya toppled defending champion Boris Becker in five sets. Coming so early this sort of gripping contest whets the appetite.<br>Instead viewers saw rather too many boring baseline rallies punctuated by errors. That is the gamble Seven takes every year by opting for a full coverage. It would be easier to cover from the quarter finals on and concentrate on the fight to the death.<br>But that would mean viewers would not see Australians, except in the doubles.<br>Still, the crowds are flocking in record numbers to the renamed Melbourne Park. The people are not too concerned at seeing a virtual army of Spaniards, Swedes, Swiss, Austrians, Germans, and, most surprisingly, Belgians, dominate.<br>Australia's last big hope was the ever-faithful Mark Woodforde. The red-headed leftie always gives his best, but sad to say he struck tournament and world No.1 Pete Sampras in awesome form on Saturday night.<br>The resulting 6-1 6-0 6-1 thrashing had old warriors John Newcombe and Pat Cash scratching for superlatives. Poor Woodforde looked like a man in front of a firing squad, licking dry lips and staring with glazed eyes at Pistol Pete's armoury.<br>The Sampras-Woodforde match was supposed to have offered prime viewing on Saturday night TV. It was over in one hour 19 minutes. The result was on ABC radio news at 7.21pm, 39 minutes before Seven started its delayed night-time coverage. TV viewers were still on the edge of their seats, waiting to see if Milo and Otis would survive.<br>The commentary overall is not bad, but it was only day two when Peter Landy pulled out the evergreen ?it's a big ask? when speculating that Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge might be forced to play both singles and doubles in next month's Davis Cup tie against France.<br></font></p>
