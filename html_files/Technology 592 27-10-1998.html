            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE quest for information made possible by a Net connection knows few bounds.<br>The Weather1 program made by a small American outfit called Design2 can now deliver a global feast of that most talked-about piece of everyday life ... the weather.<br>Weather1 is a trivia-buff's treat.<br>Not only can you find the prevailing weather conditions at the official Mt Lawley centre, you can get information from weather stations at Busselton, Albany, Bencubbin, Carnarvon, Katanning, Mardie ... almost anywhere in WA. But the big list of WA centres is only a small parcel of what Weather1 allows you to plug into.<br>Naturally there are hundreds of American centres, as this is a piece of US shareware.<br>But you can eavesdrop on a dozen centres in Finland, more in France - in fact, most of Europe is your oyster - and a fair selection from Egypt, Kenya, India and Japan.<br>If the weather station has the information, you are shown the current temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, humidity, wind chill and the hours of sunset and sunrise.<br>Weather1 can also pick up forecasts, warnings and advisories, infra-red satellite images, radar images, weather cams, 10-day temperature outlooks, and even population information (though this is restricted to the US figure and the population of the world).<br>Users who download this slim program have the choice of registering it for about $16 or continuing to run it free (in which case a nag screen will pop up each time you use a different function).<br>Registered versions of Weather1 allow users to have hourly updates of weather conditions. Update time for the unregistered version is three and a half hours.<br>As many as 20 weather stations can be preset for current condition readings. All images - still mostly of the US - can also be set automatically as wallpaper.<br>Weather1 can be minimised to a system tray icon where it will still display the current conditions.<br>Design2 claims users have taken a liking to the product. It has posted several testimonials at its Web site, including these:?The program is amazingly stable and runs so unobtrusively in the background that I haven't noticed any tapping of system resources.?<br>?This is one of the most amazing programs I have downloaded from the Web since '94.?<br>At the moment, Weather1 runs only on Windows platforms.<br>Download from: www.design2graphics.com<br></font></p>
