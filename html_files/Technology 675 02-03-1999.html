            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT event made the earth move for you this century?<br>Was it the invention of plastic, the beginning of World War I, the development of the first computer, or one of 97 other choices?<br>Web surfers can now tell the world - the virtual one anyway - what their top news events were. They can cast a vote at the impressive Newseum site, set up by the Freedom Forum in Virginia.<br>The top 100 news events have been listed and voting by e-mail, or by faxing a form printed out from the site, will be open all year.<br>This will give everyone plenty of time to dwell on a serious list and to work out for themselves the importance of events.<br>The top 100 stories were chosen and ranked last week by leading journalists and historians in the US.<br>They rated the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima as No.1, ahead of Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.<br>Those top three stories already say a lot about the list - and the content of the Web - in that it has a strong American bias.<br>The list's compilers each selected their 25 most important events in order. Their lists were combined to produce a final ranking of 100.<br>?It was agonising,? CNN correspondent Judy Woodruff told Associated Press. She selected Hiroshima ?because so many people died and it drove home the awful power of this new instrument?.<br>Historian Arthur Schlesinger looked at events differently. He chose Armstrong's moon walk as No.1, and also rated the discoveries of DNA, penicillin, the computer and the microchip in the first 10 ?because they've transformed civilisation?.<br>The American flavour of the list was summed up by the Washington Post's legendary Ben Bradlee, who ranked the attack on Pearl Harbour at No.1. ?World War II was 25 per cent of my life at one time,? he said.<br>The assassination of President John F. Kennedy (No.6 on the final list) was No.2 for him. ?He was a friend.?<br>www.newseum.com<br></font></p>
