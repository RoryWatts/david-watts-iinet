            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WAS a very public embrace so I don't feel such a rotter talking about it. The young, obviously very much in love couple, could not resist a lovely kiss and cuddle in full view of coffee-shop loungers and smoking office workers in a square just off St Georges Terrace this week.<br>One of the beauties of life is the courting couple, caring little for anything but each other, flaunting their healthy youth in its full bloom.<br>They rank with giggling toddlers and hand-holding pensioners as one of the affirmations that life can be good.<br>But as the pretty girl folded herself into the handsome boy's chest, closed her eyes and snuggled into his shoulder, I could see another of life's funny mysteries unfold.<br>He clasped her tight and protectively and nuzzled her ear. But he was gazing off into the distance with a puzzled air.<br>Being a man of the world, I could almost read his mind. The lad was saying to himself: ?Why would they drop Michael Slater from the Test team? He's got an average of 48.?<br>Whatever the girl asked him as they reluctantly ended their embrace, I am sure he answered ?yes darling? without really having the foggiest idea of what she was talking about.<br>There it was again - another example of the great difference between men and women. And even though I have put thoughts in minds, I probably wasn't far off the mark.<br>Perhaps the lad was following the girl's conversation fully ... this time. One day soon he won't. The magic of courtship will go and it will be a man and a woman, two more different members of the animal kingdom you couldn't hope to find.<br>To emphasise, here are some things that you wouldn't normally hear men say to other men:<br>Oooh, I do like your hair.<br>Where did you get those shoes/that coat?<br>I'll pop in after kindy duty.<br>I need to talk about it.<br>What do you put in your kids' school lunches?<br>Let's have a coffee and chat.<br>Likewise, you normally won't hear women say the following to other women:<br>Maaate.<br>How they hangin'?<br>Wanna beer?<br>Benny Cousins/Scott Chisholm, hey.<br>What do you like in the fifth?<br>Who's got the remote?<br>To further emphasise the men-women divide you might care to answer these multiple choice questions originally asked by American humorist Dave Barry.<br>1. Alien beings from a highly advanced society visit Earth and present you with a small but sophisticated device capable of curing all disease, providing infinite clean energy, and wiping out hunger and poverty.<br>You decide to: a) Present it to the President of the United States. b) Present it to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. c) Take it apart.<br>2. In your opinion, the ideal pet is: a) A cat. b) A dog. c) A dog that eats cats.<br>All I can say is vive la difference.<br>???<br>CAFES are great places to meet, have coffee, read, watch the world go by or even eat in. But modern trends have decreed that they are also the most fashionable places to be seen.<br>Accordingly cafes are attracting the sort of hype once reserved for art galleries or fashion houses.<br>This extract from an Australian architecture magazine about the requirements of designing a Melbourne noshery is a case in point.<br>?We were interested in exploring the cafe as an interactive public spectacle, incorporating both representational and abstract ornamentation, with the potential for architectural materials to interact with the ambiguities of human perception.?<br>Well and good - but are the toasted sarnies any good?<br></font></p>
