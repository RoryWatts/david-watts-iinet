            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE price of fame appeared high for the Discovery Channel Online site at the weekend.<br>It was named Cool Site of the Year by World Wide Web surfers voting at the Infi.net annual awards.<br>But less than 24 hours after the award, the site was uncontactable from several Perth servers because of what appeared to be network congestion.<br>It was possibly coincidence. Despite Infi.net saying repeatedly that the Cool Site winners were to be announced on Friday night (early Saturday afternoon Perth time), no announcement appeared on the Web here until late Saturday night.<br>When the congestion died, a visit to Discovery revealed a well-organised and informative site, operating at a far higher level than just an Internet promotion of the cable TV channel obtainable through Galaxy in WA, and Foxtel in the east.<br>Discovery Online is a more sober-suited winner than surfers have come to expect from Infi.Net. Its Cool Site of the Day often appears to favour more hip and alternative sites, such as Hotwired.<br>But the vote for site of the year was open to any surfers and they chose the corporate elegance of Discovery over Damaged Californians, Salon, Word and iMusic - all more in the hip category.<br>There were few surprises in other categories. The lightning fast Alta Vista was Searcher of the Year, Netscape remained Browser of the Year and Java was Innovation of the Year, beating Shockwave, Pointcast and Real Audio.<br>The late drug guru and author Dr Timothy Leary's home page was Personal Home Page of the Year. Its innovative use of slightly surrealistic graphics and Dr Leary's descriptions of his battle with terminal illness made it hard to beat.<br>Hotwired was voted Still Cool Site of the Year, recognising its continuing ability to attract Web traffic with stylish innovations. Contenders for this award had to be cool sites of the day from Infi.net's first year of operation and still capable of setting trends on the Web.<br>The Cool Script of the Year went to Ask Dr Science for being the best at combining theme, function and writing.<br>URLs<br>Cool Site of the Year<br>cool.infi.net/vote3.html<br>People magazine<br>pathfinder.com/@028@JwUAuiv6LNDx/people/daily/daily.html<br></font></p>
