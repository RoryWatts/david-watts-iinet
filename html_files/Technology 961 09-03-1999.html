            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MUSIC<br>Dusty Springfield: Woman of Repute<br>www.isd.net/mbayly/index.html<br>THIS site regards Dusty Springfield, who died last week, as one of the world's finest female vocalists. A sweeping textual tribute to the English singer, it cites Rolling Stone magazine's description of Springfield as the country's ?best ever pop-singer?, and Sir Cliff Richard's tag of ?the white negress? among many others.<br>Woman of Repute has plenty of laudatory articles about Springfield, pictures, a discography and news that is so well updated (for a fan page) that it spoke of her death only hours after it happened.<br>One of the highlights, though, is its annotated links to other Springfield sites.<br>Among them are: A Girl Called Dusty, Dusty Springfield: Pure Excellence, Sonnydj's Music Archives (which contains RealAudio samples of her work), I Only Want To Be With You: The Dusty Springfield Story, and The Ice Queen (an article from Memphis, Tennessee, that tries to come to grips with Springfield's phenomenal range).<br>SPORT<br>Australia in the West Indies<br>www.candw.cricket.bb<br>UNLESS you have Foxtel, you will not see Australia's Tests in the West Indies. And unless you are on late-night shifts, or are an insomniac, you won't be able to listen to the ABC's radio coverage. This gives Web cricket sites a big chance to impress as an alternative medium for fans.<br>This is the site of series sponsors Cable and Wireless. It aims to keep cricket lovers up to date with news and scores from the Windies as well as showing the most recent pictures after each day's play in the Tests and one-dayers.<br>SEARCH<br>Google<br>www.google.com<br>GOOGLE is turning heads in the online world with its fast returns and sleek format.<br>It is no portal groaning with e-commerce links like so many of the other big search engines. Instead it offers a search window and two buttons, one to return the results and one marked ?I'm feeling lucky? which will go straight to the site that Google determines as the one most fitting your search criteria.<br></font></p>
