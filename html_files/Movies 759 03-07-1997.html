            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ANACONDA H H H ½<br>It's a pity that drive-ins have gone the way of adding machines, telegrams and beach girl contests because this Creature Feature is the perfect flick to watch in a car with a bunch of screaming teens. Despite an obviously big budget and impressive digital effects, Anaconda is very much in the B-Grade tradition of The Blob and The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, unpretentious entertainment designed to make you clutch the arm of the person sitting next you. The biggest surprise of all is how well it works. Avoiding the temptation to tell the standard morality tale about nature taking revenge (Dante's Peak, Volcano), director Luis Llosa is a little like the giant serpent itself - he goes straight for the jugular and doesn't let go until you've been sucked dry. Or, in the case of John Voight's villainous snake hunter Sarone, chewed up and spat out. Yes, this movie is as funny as it is scary, with shrieks and laughs coming simultaneously as the dinosaur-sized anaconda reaches in and snaffles another delicacy from the floating dining table. If you thought Mike Tyson had a nasty bite wait "til you get a load of this slithering killing machine. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE SWAN PRINCESS IIWhen the original Swan Princess was released in 1994 it was warmly greeted by the critics. Roger Ebert described it as ?probably the best in a series of Disney wannabes - animated features combining music, advanced graphics and more sophisticated characters?. What everyone loved most about The Swan Princess were the voices which brought the characters to life - John Cleese, Jack Palance, Sandy Duncan and the delightfully deadpan Steven Wright. While director Richard Rich is back for the sequel, subtitled Escape from Castle Mountain, a cast of unknowns provide the voices for Princess Odette, Prince Derek, Speed the turtle, Jean-Bob the frog and the others. Which probably won't matter for the youngsters at which this animated feature is clearly aimed. They'll no doubt be swept up in the story of how the wicked Clavius schemes to get Prince Derek out of the way so he can sneak into the castle at Swan Lake and snatch the magic orb which will give him the power to rule the kingdom. While The Swan Princess II is probably not much more than a video release it does at least give parents with younger children a pleasant alternative to the horrors of Volcano and Anaconda. Rated G (Not Previewed)<br>BEAN: THE ULTIMATE DISASTER MOVIE H H H<br>Resist the urge to run from the cinema screaming because getting to the end of Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie can be rewarding in itself. Bean does grow on you, trust me, thanks to the brilliance of Rowan Atkinson and a forgiving script. In his first big-screen adventure, the nauseating nitwit invades America. He wreaks havoc in the lives of some unsuspecting and undeserving art gallery execs at California's Grierson Gallery who simply extended an invitation to the Royal National Gallery to send a representative, a great and notable scholar, to unveil their new $50m painting. Their English colleagues seize the opportunity to get rid of disaster master Mr Bean for a short time and bundle him on the first plane across the Atlantic. I'm pretty sure I've seen Mr Bean do the old spew in the bag trick in the aeroplane scene before but hey, if it works once, why not use it again? The man with a million and one ridiculous facial contortions might make you want to pull your hair out but the question is, is he really just a walking, talking nightmare or a lovable pommy git who lacks serious love and attention? Rated PG (Carolyn Martin)<br>CHASING AMY H H H H<br>After going down in flames with the studio-backed Mallrats, his erratic follow-up to the cult sensation Clerks, precocious indie auteur Kevin Smith returns to the low-budget terrain he knows best to make his most mature, most personal work to date. Drawing on his own fears about the sexual history of women with whom he becomes involved, Smith tells the story of a hip comic book artist named Holden (Ben Affleck) who falls head-over-heels in love with fellow artist Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams). They're a perfect match, or so Holden thinks until he discovers that Alyssa is a lesbian. In reality this would probably dump cold water on any relationship; however, in a romantic comedy it's just one more hill for the hero to climb. Smith is not much of a visual stylist, preferring to anchor the camera and let his characters talk. Luckily they're among the most entertaining talkers in movies today, running off the mouth about everything from Superman to the dangers of cunnilingus. Better still, Smith has found a way to let them speak from the heart, pushing Holden and Alyssa into emotional territory so dangerous even Tarantino would hesitate to follow. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE LIARS H H H H<br>THERE'S no one like the French for fashioning stylish mystery tales about the nature of truth and the way incidents and character can be manipulated to achieve ambitions. Elie Chouraquie's The Liars is a fine example of a contemporary mystery tale about disappearance, lies and deception. It's also a film about the craft of film-making itself. Jean-Hugues Anglade's Zac is a film director who turns up after months of living on the streets with an extraordinary tale of tragic lovers. His tale will be turned into a new film with the help of Daisy, an ingenue scriptwriter who has managed by subterfuge to insert herself into the household of Zac's lover Helene. Often a very funny story about the endless possibilities of story-telling, Liars manages to be by turns comedy, romance, thriller and an essay on the nature of truth. Fine performances add to the stylish gloss. One for those who enjoyed The Apartment, to which it bears some similarities in style, tone and cleverness. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST H H ½<br>In this fanciful play on the classic children's story Beauty and The Beast, big-haired beauty teacher Joy Miller (Fran Drescher) becomes an accidental hero when her night classroom burns down. She makes front page headlines, is mistaken by a well meaning political envoy from the fictitious republic of Slovenia for a science teacher and is offered a job tutoring the president's children. And so begins a comic clash of cultures, personalities and ideology. This vehicle is purpose-built for Drescher, who teeters around in high heels and figure-hugging pants, brightening up the president's morbid castle with not just her clothing but her colourful (but somewhat inane) ideas on everything from romance to politics. Yet it is hardly a challenge for Drescher, merely another extension of her Nanny character Fran Fine. Timothy Dalton is suitably standoffish as the ?beastly? president but the pair lack onscreen chemistry. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>BATMAN & ROBIN H H ½<br>In this fourth installment of Batman director Joel Schumacher seems intent on reviving the campy hi-jinks of the 60s TV series. Gone is the existential gloom of the Burton-directed Batmans: this is Batman Lite. The problem is that Schumacher's movie lacks the panache and punch - in performances, dialogue and direction - required to pull off the campy, over-the-top style. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE CELLULOID CLOSET H H H H<br>Homosexuality has been a part of movies since the days of Griffith and DeMille, only we've been too blinkered to notice. After seeing this wonderfully revealing compilation documentary you'll watch every old movie with a sharp eye for the wink, the walk and the gesture that will let you in on the big secret. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE EIGHTH DAY H H ½<br>Despite fine performances from Cannes-winners Daniel Auteuil, as a burnt-out businessman, and Pascal Duquenne, as a young man with Down's syndrome, Belgian director Jaco van Dormael (Toto the Hero) strikes too many false notes in this Hollywood-style buddy movie. The pair are thrown together when a dog is killed, an arbitrary event which typifies this poorly realised film. Rated PG (Ron Banks)<br>INVENTING THE ABBOTS H H<br>This determinedly old-fashioned melodrama about sex, sibling rivalry and class conflict in a small Illinois town in the 1950s is so sluggish and has such uninteresting characters that it might have been called The Young and the Listless. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE H H ½<br>TV Toolman Man Tim hits the nail on the head a couple of times with his follow-up to The Santa Clause. For the most part, however, Jungle 2 Jungle is all thumbs - a slack, slapdash remake of the French hit comedy Un Indien dans la Ville. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>LIAR, LIAR H H HThere are some side-splitting scenes in this Jim Carrey comedy about a compulsive liar and lawyer forced to tell the truth when his son's birthday wish comes true. However, the film relies too heavily on Carrey's rubbery facial distortions for easy laughs. Strictly for Carrey fans. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>THE LOST WORLD H H H ½<br>There are at least three different films squeezed inside this sequel to Jurassic Park - an Hatari!-inspired man-as-predator movie, a chase movie with T-Rex making like T2 and, finally, King Kong by way of Godzilla. It's an awkward fit but, in one gob-smacking sequence after another, Steven Spielberg shows that his three-year lay-off hasn't dulled his ability to make us jump out of our seats at the appropriate moment. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>MICROCOSMOS H H H H<br>If you thought Spielberg had created terrifying monsters in The Lost World wait "til you get a load of the little beasties in Microcosmos, an intriguing French-made docu about a day in the life of the bug universe. Blown up to dinosaur size by a specially designed camera, the ruthless spider, Sisyphean dung beetle and amorous snails give their Hollywood counterparts a run for their money. Rated G (Mark Naglazas)<br>PARADISE ROAD H H HBruce Beresford tells the true-life story of a group of women who sing for their survival inside a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp with great taste and sensitivity. But in the end he's defeated by the material's inherent lack of drama. With no chance of escape and little real conflict, contrast or even moral choice, Beresford relies too heavily on the stirring music to carry us across the finish line. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>SOME MOTHER'S SON H H H H<br>The team behind In the Name of the Father once again filter the troubles in Northern Ireland through a cross-generational conflict, this time between a pacifist mother (Helen Mirren) and her IRA sympathiser son who's prepared to die in the infamous 1981 Maze Prison hunger strike. Powerful performances and a tough, even-handed script from director Terry George and co-writer Jim Sheridan. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>SWINGERS H H H H<br>Writer-star Jon Favreau uses the cliches of the post-Tarantino guy movie - the coffee shops and silver-tongued talk about nothing, Vegas and the hipster's love of kitsch, the macho swagger and beautiful ?babies? - to tell us something about masculine self-delusion and insecurity in the city of broken dreams. Funny, touching. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>VOLCANO H H<br>Ther are thrills and laughs to be had when molten lava bubbles up out of LA's Le Brea Tar Pits and oozes down fashionable Wilshire Boulevard. Unfortunately, all those fossilised disaster movie cliches - the hero with domestic problems, the screaming teenager, the plucky dog, the slow-thinking city officials - pour out at the same time, threatening to melt our brains if we get too close. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE APARTMENT H H H<br>While he cheats on point-of-view in a way Hitchcock never would, Gilles Mimouni makes an impressively bold debut in this sleek, Paris-set romantic thriller about a man who pursues an obscure object of desire. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE ASSOCIATEHH½<br>This occasionally amusing comedy about a Wall Street whiz who invents a male partner to break through the glass ceiling provides Whoopi Goldberg with her strongest role in some time. It buckles under the weight of Goldberg's drag outfit. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>BIG NIGHT H H H H<br>Although food, glorious food is the subject of this gentle, European-style comedy about a restaurant-saving nosh-up, it's really about the cultural and emotional sacrifices immigrants have to make if they're to become a part of a new country. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE CASTLE H H H<br>The Frontline team make a smooth transition from small to big screen using their subtle, naturalistic style to tell the tale of an Oz family so low on the evolutionary scale they make the Simpsons look like the Kennedys. Not nearly as richly layered as the average episode of Frontline but the dialogue and performances are funny. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>HAMLET H H H H ½<br>Length is perhaps the strongest aspect of Kenneth Branagh's breathtaking full-text version of Hamlet, so this abridged two-hour version of Shakespeare's great tragedy is bound to be considerably weaker. Then again, those of us without the time of Hamlet to ponder the great questions will be grateful for this Jenny Craig version - fat-free yet with enough fibre to keep our brains healthy. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>LADY AND THE TRAMP H H H<br>IT would be churlish to describe this 1955 Disney animation as anything but endearing. The bumpy love story of the upper-class cocker spaniel and the mongrel from the wrong side of the tracks was the first Disney deviation from much-loved fairy tales and folk stories. It took nearly 20 years from conception by Walt himself to bring to the big screen and has remained a children's favourite since. The songs by Peggy Lee and the humorous characterisation of animals - especially Si and Am the dreadful cats - are the highlights. The story and homely morals are pure 50s Americana and the film pales a little compared with more recent Disney efforts - Aladdin, Toy Story and the Little Mermaid particularly - but it is cute. Rated G (David Watts)<br>WALLACE AND GROMIT H H H H<br>Tom Hanks might have two Oscars on his mantlepiece but he's beaten hands down by a guy named Nick Park. Nick Who? He's the genius behind Wallace and Gromit, the cheese-loving inventor and his brainy dog. All three Wallace and Gromit adventures - A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave - are on the same program for the first time, beginning on Saturday at the Luna Cinemas. It's worth noting that A Grand Day out was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to Creature Comforts, which was directed by none other than Nick Park. (Mark Naglazas) Rated G<br></font></p>
