            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT'S approach to making Web browsers has been likened to building cars without steering wheels.<br>An American user group, the Web Standards Project, last week attacked the software giant for failing to say it will fully support the implementation of key standards in its next Internet Explorer browser.<br>The project, known as WSP, has written to Microsoft and begun a Web-based lobbying campaign aimed at achieving uniform standards for browsers.<br>WSP claims that Microsoft is not committed to browser standards drawn up by the World Wide Web Consortium and designed to make Web pages easily read no matter what software views them.<br>?By releasing browsers which do not uniformly support those standards, browser makers are injuring Web developers, businesses and users alike,? WSP says at its Web site. ?Lack of uniform support for W3C standards makes using and developing Web-based technologies unnecessarily difficult and expensive.?<br>Project leader George Olsen said the current dispute between AOL and Microsoft over instant messaging showed how incompatible standards hurt the public.<br>?For browsers, there are common standards but Microsoft appears to be non-committal about finishing off implementing them in Internet Explorer, saying there isn't public demand for them,? Mr Olsen said. ?Unfortunately, implementing most of these standards but not finishing key areas is like building a car but forgetting to install the steering wheel. Technically, it's almost done, but it's not usable.?<br>WSP's open letter to Microsoft asks for 100 per cent support for Cascading Style Sheets Level-1, HTML 4.0, DOM 1.0 and XML 1.0 in the next version of Internet Explorer. ?Full support of these standards will enable developers and designers to finally embrace this technology, which Microsoft helped create and which Microsoft was the first to begin supporting,? the letter says.<br>WSP says Microsoft would suffer in comparison with rival Netscape if it failed to support the standards.<br>Up to the most recent versions of its browsers, Microsoft has shown better support for standards, but WSP believes that will change when Netscape releases Navigator 5.0.<br>Reports suggest that the open source style used for developing Navigator 5.0 will deliver total support for standards.<br>Internet Explorer has leapt to its biggest lead in the browser war, according to recent figures from both Stat Market and Browserwatch. Explorer was used by nearly 74 per cent of all visitors to the Stat Market analysis site last week, compared with 25 per cent who used Netscape.<br>Since the beginning of the year, Explorer has jumped from 65 per cent share, while Netscape has dropped from 33 per cent.<br>The latest version 5.0 of Explorer has nearly 24 per cent of users.<br>Figures are much closer at Browserwatch - which logs only one-10th the traffic of Stat Market. Browserwatch last week showed Explorer had 45 per cent of the market, compared with 35 per cent for Navigator. The lightweight Opera browser from Norway had a surprisingly high 10 per cent share.<br>Netscape's share has dropped from more than 80 per cent in late 1995.<br>HELP DESK<br>Web Standards Project:<br>www.webstandards.org<br>Stat Market: www.statmarket.com<br>Browserwatch: www.browserwatch.com<br></font></p>
