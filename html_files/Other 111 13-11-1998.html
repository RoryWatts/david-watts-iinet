            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BOOKER Prize-winning novelist Ian McEwan is a dirty, rotten scoundrel . . . or so it appears if you use the Web hastily. Keen to find out about recent literary triumphs, I set up a search with the HotBot engine. It gave the following result when the word ?Amsterdam? (the title of McEwan's prize- winner) was keyed in: ?XXX XXX nude teen Video Amsterdam nude teen?. A glance at the page on offer - number four in the results after three sites in Dutch - showed that it did not have a word about Amsterdam. The name of the city was entered in a field of coding that tricks search engines into believing porn sites are actually something else.<br>Instead of Amsterdam, the site promised ?Totally FREE Unrestricted Access to 11 Top Adult web sites!!? as well as ?Thousands of X-Rated Porn Flicks?, and ?Free Live Girls ALL the Time?.<br>The problem is related to human logic. Our brains are too quick and think too abstractly for even the most powerful PC. It is a lesson easily learnt on the Web which, because it houses so much stuff and places it before us so quickly, sometimes seems an intelligent being that will respond to lateral thinking. But it is not. It nearly always requires that we do things by the numbers. So the correct way to find out about McEwan, the Booker, and the novel Amsterdam is not to jump to the Amsterdam conclusion straight away. It is to start with the words ?Booker Prize?.<br>From my experience last week this did not produce a single XXX nude teen site. Nor did it produce much about the Booker.<br>The PR agency, Colman Getty, had some basic information. Far better was the work of a Melbourne man, Perry Middlemiss, who has an excellent site called Larrikin's Lair.<br>It has a list of each year's finalists, some news about the contest and links to other sites with more information about either the books or their authors.<br>But following the tangential thought process that a site like Larrikin's Lair allows, you are able to arrive at the Ian McEwan home page, a site created by a fan in the UK.<br>It is a bit spare on information about Amsterdam but does have reviews and news about all his other works. It also offers interviews and articles about the author.<br>If you want to know what Amsterdam is like, the Guardian has a page with the views of three top London critics.
