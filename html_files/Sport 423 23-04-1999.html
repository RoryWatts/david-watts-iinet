            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">YOU have to envy someone like Mick Malthouse who is able to quote ancient Chinese philosophers and warlords. When stuck for a word, how wonderful to say: ?He who does not fear death by a thousand cuts, dares to unhorse the emperor?, or ?The ox is slow but the Earth is patient?.<br>But how much better to invent your own quote, one that will survive the tests of time.<br>Because of events during the recent school holidays, I believe I have come up with a contender. It is: ?You do not know someone truly, until you have seen their legs.?<br>I have searched Bartlett's Familiar Quotations on the Internet, using the keyword ?legs?, and there is nothing to worry about there. So it's off to the brilliant quotes copyright office with this one.<br>How did it come about? Well, recently our little family played host to some very good English friends who were on their first visit to Australia. We were neighbours of these people for four years in a nice London suburb somewhat closer to Heathrow than we would have liked. The flight path did not go over our house, but it did go over the bloke next door's.<br>In those four years in the late 80s we experienced two summers that the locals considered jolly warm. However, we never saw the male head of our visiting family in anything but long corduroy trousers.<br>When they landed in Perth a couple of weeks ago, they brought with them a spell of un-autumn-like weather. And as they had digs just a skateboard-jump from Cottesloe beach, they were in the water every day.<br>Not with long corduroy trousers though. Out came the shorts, and with them a pair of extremely white, hairy legs. I was able to look at my English mate in a totally new way . . . but only with sunglasses to shield the glare from that white skin.<br>What do you do with a group of Poms for two weeks in WA? Show them Kings Park, perhaps Rottnest, then what?<br>We decided to be very Australian about it all and tell them shark stories. Naturally there were the shark jokes such as:<br>What's red and mushy and found between a shark's teeth?<br>Slow swimmers.<br>This did not seem to faze them, but as they were regulars at Cottesloe every day, we decided to go big on the Brian Sierakowski story; of how the prominent Perth lawyer's wave ski was chomped by a great white just near where they were swimming.<br>We even took them to Cicerello's to show them the crunched-up ski and the enlarged copies of newspaper reports about the incident.<br>They were not worried.<br>So we moved on to kangaroos, which they were keen to see. We took them to Yuppie-up, an area rich with vineyards, doctors and stockbrokers near Margaret River. On a mad whim we drove them down Caves Road at sunset just as a fierce electrical storm broke.<br>This made every roo from Busselton to Augusta decide to stand completely still in the middle of the road near tricky corners, so they could not be seen until the car was 10 metres away.<br>Lots of stamping on the brakes and cries of ?blimey, look at the roo, isn't it beautiful? from the guests.<br>Sharks did not frighten them, nor roos on the road. And the snake they saw - a one-metre dugite -was so comatose in the warm sun that it was about as dangerous as a wombat.<br>In short, nothing we Aussies could dig up did anything to put the Poms off WA. They gloried in the weather, the emptiness, the choice of food and drink, the friendly service and even the driving habits.<br>When they arrived back in London, they phoned to<br>report it was 10C, the rain was coming in sideways and some scumbag had set off a bomb in a crowded supermarket in Brixton.<br>Sometimes we don't know how lucky we are.<br></font></p>
