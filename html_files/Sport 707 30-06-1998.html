            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT WOULD be safe to say that Mick Malthouse has little in common with Pauline Hanson.<br>That gap grew even wider at the weekend when the red-haired One Nation leader called for all Australians to speak English (possibly so she would never have to say ?please explain? again).<br>On the other hand, the grey-haired West Coast coach lamented the fact that his charges - upset by an undermanned Melbourne - could read and understand the language at all, and thus believe the publicity about themselves.<br>The fact is the Eagles were thrashed. Melbourne's margin may have been only 17 points, but it was the second-biggest belting West Coast has had this season after the 19-point loss to Sydney at the WACA Ground in round four.<br>The team is proving as enigmatic as Fraser Gehrig. One day soon it really will be thrashed, or maybe thrash someone else instead of causing heart attacks among its supporters with close finishes week after week.<br>Heart attacks used to be the preserve of Fremantle. After Saturday's 90-point thrashing by Richmond at the MCG, one suspects that supporters might be reaching for the cyanide pills.<br>It was a game coach Gerard Neesham hoped would win some respect. Unfortunately, even Channel 7's commentary team was reduced to laughing openly at Fremantle's efforts.<br>The AFL had its fair share of thrashings at the weekend: Brisbane walloping Collingwood and Adelaide looking ominous over Sydney.<br>In the second round of the World Cup, Brazil affirmed its brilliance with a 4-1 disposal of Chile, and Denmark did the same, surprisingly, to Nigeria.<br>In a game where a goal can cause a near riot, 4-1 has to mean the same as a 10-goal AFL victory.<br>It is international rugby union, however, where one can find the most handsome thrashings.<br>At the weekend, New Zealand beat England - undermanned because many of its best players refused to tour because they had to do their hair or some-such nonsense - by 40-10.<br>This was a remarkable turnaround for England because it was beaten 64-22 by the All Blacks a week before, and 76-0 by Australia earlier this month. Obvious signs of improvement there.<br>Wales, once a stronghold of the game, lost 96-13 to South Africa in Pretoria on Saturday night.<br>You had to have Foxtel to see either NZ or South Africa's triumphs as the game has all but vanished from Channel 7's repertoire.<br>And Channel 9 continues to show rain delays at Wimbledon two hours after they have happened, leaving tennis fans the choice of Foxtel, the VCR or some strong coffee.<br>Sometimes, damn good thrashings should not be reserved for sportsmen only.<br></font></p>
