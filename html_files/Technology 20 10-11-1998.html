            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT'S new browser might be good, but it is a pain in the mouse to download and install.<br>The compressed file is 18,900k in size. It took me two hours 20 minutes to download it with a 28.8k modem. It then took another 10 minutes for the system to install it, restart and reconfigure itself.<br>It all looks deceptively simple. Go to the Microsoft site, say you want to download MSIE 5.0 beta, and the Windows automatic update page is summoned.<br>Nice if it worked, but it didn't on Thursday, the day of the release.<br>After five attempts and 30 minutes I went elsewhere (see Help Desk for alternative sites).<br>Users must first download a set-up file. At 452k, it takes only three minutes to run in your browser. It then prompts you to choose a download site for the main event - the 18,900k monster. The choice is wide and includes OzEmail in Australia.<br>Then it is time to sit back and wait ... and wait ... and wait some more.<br>After 17,132k, my connection to OzEmail stalled for 10 minutes.<br>The clever Microsoft download program decided to try different sites to resume the process without cutting off the download.<br>It got me one in Portugal which laboured through the remaining 1800k.<br>After all that, MSIE 5.0 was finally there in all its glory.<br>Well not quite. I chose the Standard version. The Deluxe weighs in at 45Mb.<br>Next time I will wait for the CD-ROM version.<br></font></p>
