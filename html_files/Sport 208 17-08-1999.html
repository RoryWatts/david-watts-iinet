            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA FOOTBALL followers appear to be optimists, but not masochists.<br>We continue to watch the game on television in big numbers, despite the abysmal form of both West Coast and Fremantle.<br>Figures provided by Channel 7 program manager Jamie Martinovich show that Eagles and Dockers games dominate their time slots.<br>But Fremantle's slide since the western derby win seems partly responsible for a less than stellar ratings performance on Sunday.<br>The game against Brisbane on Sunday attracted 57 per cent of the available TV audience, or an average of 142,500 viewers over the three hours. West Coast's miserable Sunday afternoon in Brisbane three weeks ago was watched by 201,400, or 75 per cent of the audience.<br>The drop in the Dockers' figure might be caused because:<br>?Fewer people watch Fremantle in any case.<br>?Most of us had seen the Lions go mad and it was not a pretty sight for loyal West Australians.<br>Two weeks ago, nearly 74 per cent of the Sunday afternoon audience tuned in for Fremantle's inept performance against Hawthorn. The size of the audience - much bigger than for the Brisbane game - might be explained by the fact that Fremantle had just come off a small loss (to Port Adelaide) and had hopes of victory.<br>On Saturday nights, when there is more competition on the tube, football still rules - 213,900 people, or 53 per cent of available viewers, watched Fremantle play Port Adelaide in round 17.<br>And West Coast commanded 45 per cent of the audience when it dropped its bundle against the lowly Hawks last Saturday.<br>Given West Coast's poor form, this figure is surprising. Back in round 14, when the Eagles were on top of the ladder, the Saturday night game against Melbourne drew 42 per cent of viewers.<br>ARE we armchair critics seeing a conspiracy between the Eagles and Dockers to smooth out West Coast's run in the finals?<br>It seems based on the fact that the Eagles are incapable of more than a quarter of good football.<br>The evidence goes back to round 13 against Geelong when West Coast blitzed the Cats in the opening term then toyed with them.<br>Since then, a good second quarter against Richmond, a top opener against Essendon and a dazzling first 30 minutes against Hawthorn.<br>The Eagles are a chance to finish sixth and make the trip to Brisbane in the first week of the finals.<br>Fremantle's part in the plot was to exhaust Brisbane by letting it run wild for the first half.<br>Next week, it's Melbourne's turn and come the finals, the Lions will be so tired from scoring so freely that it will take only one good quarter to bury them.<br>Well, it makes about as much sense as some of the Mick Malthouse rumours ...<br></font></p>
