            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE SHOULD be grateful that Rex Hunt and Bill Lawry just bash ears. Mike Tyson bites them.<br>And TV viewers are going to see the convicted rapist and street thug turning world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield's ears into mincemeat for some time.<br>Why? Because it is ugly and sports watchers are fascinated by ugliness as much as by beauty.<br>Slow-motion close-ups of Tyson munching Holyfield at Las Vegas played across our screens on Sunday night. There was more of the same yesterday morning, particularly in the American ABC news shown on Channel 9 after the Wimbledon highlights.<br>This ugly incident and the subsequent scenes of melees in the ring, the crowd fighting and fleeing in panic, and Tyson's childlike excuses rank at the very top of sport's worst moments.<br>It is up there with the crazed Liverpool and Juventus rioters at Heysel stadium in Belgium, the mad Englishman and his tackle by Terry Alderman at the WACA Ground and the crazy stabbing of Monica Seles in Hamburg.<br>All are despicable incidents and all get airplay because we, the public, are drawn to them by a morbid fascination of uncontrolled violence. Few things in the world offer the chance of this violence more than sport.<br>Put it on TV in a gun-worshipping, over-marketed cesspit like Las Vegas with obscene amounts of money at stake, and the recipe produces a simmering brew of ugliness.<br>Add a foolish thug like Tyson and your dreams are realised - real brutality from the comfort of your living room with no threat of physical harm to yourself.<br>American ABC sought reactions from Tyson's old neighbourhood in the ghettos of east New York yesterday. One might have expected some empathy here.<br>But these are some of the words disgusted residents had for the man who could have set an example by fighting fair: ?Mike Tyson is a chump, a punk.?<br>?He's a sissy. Only girls do that in fights.?<br>Despite the seriousness, there was a little room for humour. Sylvester Stallone, who played the battler Rocky Balboa on screen, said: ?He should've eaten before the fight.?<br>In the Washington Post, columnist Michael Wilbon commented under the headline, Ear Today, Gone Tomorrow: ?What was once an incredible career may have been destroyed for all intents and purposes on Saturday night. Given the way Tyson has chosen time after time to conduct himself, so be it.?<br>The Los Angeles Times said on its front page: ?The stain of Tyson's actions might never be washed away, for him or the sport he once ruled.?<br>The Times in London often prefers higher brow editorials on European union, Hong Kong and the IRA to sport. It chose to put Tim Henman's five-set epic win at Wimbledon on page one yesterday, but thundered against Tyson in an editorial under the headline, Foul Play: ?Millions of television viewers this weekend saw a spectacle so disgusting that even those hardened to violence and gore were outraged.?<br>And so it goes, no one has a good word for Tyson, and no one should.<br>He has ruined his career and his so-called sport as well as leaving for all an indelible video image of his monstrosity.<br></font></p>
