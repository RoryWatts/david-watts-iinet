            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FORGET the top eight in the AFL.<br>Life is hard enough without having to work out the permutations and combinations that would let Fremantle in and keep Port Adelaide, Brisbane, the Western Bulldogs or even North Melbourne out.<br>And it is just as hard to work out West Coast's chances of making the top four and securing a home final.<br>Round 20 did armchair calculators no favours. It did not even allow much enjoyment of good football, given the bad weather and mostly grim nature of the contests.<br>Given the mostly ordinary games and the headache-making calculations, it is time for easier pickings.<br>Like a commentators' top eight.<br>Channel 7's team has a much wider spread of talent - from very good to exasperating - than the tightly competitive 16 teams in the competition.<br>Here is my top eight. It includes the experts:<br>Dennis Cometti: Okay, so he's West Australian. But he is also easy to listen to, accurate and original (?like a cork in the ocean, Matera bobs along?).<br>Leigh Matthews: ?Lethal? adds the perspectives of a respected coach and a true champion and does it in a relaxed and friendly way.<br>Ross Glendinning: Yes, another West Australian. He is very serious and intense when he has to be; after all, he is looking at the whys and wherefores. But Glendinning also has an easy TV voice and relaxed delivery.<br>Bruce McAvaney: Seven's main talking head is hard to beat in nearly any sport. His grasp of the subject, well modulated tones and excitement make up for his obsessions with stars like Wayne Carey.<br>Gerard Healy: Fast becoming the most relaxed man in the job. Seven seems to like his style. The network put him in the Talking Footy hot seat when McAvaney was in Athens.<br>Drew Morphett: The ABC ace has not changed in years. He is still bubbly and excitable and mostly accurate.<br>Tim Watson: The Bomber champion has a bit of a dull monotone, but he often makes a lot of sense.<br>That's only seven. Unfortunately, settling on a top eight turns out to be just as hard as in the actual competition.<br>The way I see it, it boils down to a fight between Sandy Roberts and Kevin Bartlett.<br>Roberts gets over-excited but sometimes that can add to the game. Bartlett is a trier but needs to cut down on his favourite ?pass is a poor one? and know his players better.<br>Neither Don Scott nor Ian Robertson makes it because they indulge in far too much shouting and arguing about umpiring decisions.<br>If you wanted that you could always sit in the grandstand.<br></font></p>
