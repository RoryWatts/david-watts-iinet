            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT COULD easily be called the lost weekend of sport. On television, it was rained-out golf, rained-out cricket, winning Wildcats at breakfast and losing Glory three days late.<br>Throw in some wet and willing triathlon and an exciting Fruit "N' Veg Stakes, and it still was well short of a classic weekend.<br>So what do armchair fans talk about when the sport is less than enthralling?<br>They could seek positives and be enthusiastic about the Western Warriors appearing to lose their Western Worriers tag on Nine on Saturday.<br>But that was before Steve Waugh got cracking. Or they could join the nationwide anxiety over Mark Waugh's loss of form and frown over his first innings of one and ponder some of the style in his second dig of 25.<br>Not much to gain from that exercise, however. The junior Waugh has enigma written all over him as well as the support of Prime Minister John Howard and his twin brother.<br>In a bid to find something in the lost weekend, I combed Internet Web sites and discussion groups to see what was occupying fans' minds.<br>It was no surprise to find a poll at the Inside Sport site asking whether Mark Waugh deserved to hold his Test place.<br>Results will not be in until late this week, unfortunately, but polls at this site tend to go close to 50-50.<br>For example, narrow majorities have agreed:<br>That John Newcombe treats his Davis Cup side as if he was a football coach.<br>That Australia is the greatest sporting nation on Earth.<br>That the Nine cricket commentary team needs to be gone through with a fine toothcomb.<br>Hardcore football fans do not hibernate during summer either. They are all over the Net, with this quote from an Adelaide supporter to a discussion group best summarising their attitude: ?Can't wait till the footy starts ... yawn.?<br>The value of Wayne Carey was taxing supporters at the West Coast Web site, where about 80 hardy souls took part in a poll asking: ?Is Wayne Carey worth $1 million a year to a football club??<br>Carey might have topped the player of the 90s lists at both the Melbourne Sunday Age and the Herald-Sun at the weekend, edging out Tony Lockett in both. But only 24 per cent of Eagles' voters thought he deserved the money.<br>BUT for really important sport talk, I have to honour cricket discussion. After India's lacklustre Test performance and the traditional pre-Christmas slowdown in activity, the question occupying more than a few minds was: ?What happens if a batsman needs a toilet break??<br>Immediate responses were no help at all because they talked about Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon. Someone ventured that Pakistan's Iqbal Qasim had done it, others pointed to New Zealander Ewen Chatfield.<br>And naturally the discussion came to an abrupt end when a correspondent hauled out a favourite radio quote: ?The captain is relieving himself at the northern end.?<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
