            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE following is a true story. Its source is impeccable - a talented lady friend who is editor of a daily newspaper in a Queensland provincial city.<br>There is one caveat. This editor is New Zealand born and bred. Like her countrymen she would rather have a fight than a feed.<br>And a party ... and a sing-along ... and a drink or two; basically a good time.<br>It certainly was a good time that she wrote about in a Christmas message. The victim of the piece was her husband, who through no fault of his own, was turning 50. We will call him Tony ... because that is his real name.<br>Now, my party-loving editor friend, decided to make Tony's 50th memorable, so memorable that people might talk about it for 50 more years.<br>Tony and the editor run a small property where they keep horses and a dead dog in a dam (but that's another story). Tony needed to build new fences, so his birthday request was simply for some essential gear: posts, chainsaw, strainer etc.<br>He got more than he bargained for. The editor-wife decided to mount a spectacular gift-giving ceremony entitled The 12 days of Tony, using the beloved Christmas theme and bending it in her unique New Zealand fashion.<br>I'll let her tell it: ?One of the guys at work organised Tony's workmates to bring fence posts to his party. So in the middle of the festivities a truck arrived bearing balloons, streamers and 60 fence posts. Russell gave him a gate, someone else gave him two strainers, someone else bought fencing pliers and I gave him a chainsaw.<br>?He also got a personal toilet-roll holder with a clock, alarm and radio.<br>?We sang him the 12 Days of Tony, a rather involved production with a big cast to present:<br>One chainsaw;<br>Two trucking tyres;<br>Three frozen hens;<br>Four barking dogs;<br>Five golden rings (attached to five wiggling male behinds);<br>Six water pistols;<br>Seven maids-a-swiggin';<br>Eight whistles blowing;<br>Nine pairs of knickers (presented individually in twirling fashion by Tony's workmates);<br>Ten toads a-leaping (in a big fish bowl covered in Gladwrap);<br>Eleven fencing pickets;<br>Twelve flying eggs.<br>?One of the eggs missed Tony and hit the guitarist's panel van; some of the leaping toads escaped and were chucked in among the maids-a-swiggin', who scattered and Tony's mad cousin insisted on putting vinegar in the water pistols.<br>?The roaring chainsaw was a little late in arriving on cue because Russell (another Kiwi) had had a bit to drink and had trouble starting it.<br>?It went okay when he actually switched it on.?<br>In the best Queensland-New Zealand tradition it was a cultured affair and I'm glad to hear that at least one participant lived to tell the tale.<br>???<br>POST-CHRISTMAS NEWS:<br>THE London Daily Telergraph reports that Silent Night has topped the readers' charts as England's favourite Christmas carol. And rightly so, it is a beautiful piece of work. But I wonder if anyone is familiar with the following titles of carols and Christmas songs, which have been updated into modern language (and thus rendered meaningless):<br>Embellish the interior passageways;<br>Vertically challenged adolescent percussionist;<br>Soundless nocturnal period;<br>Caribou with vermilion olfactory appendage;<br>Jovial Yuletide desired for the second person singular or plural by us.<br>For those too worn out by Yule to bother, the songs are: Deck the Halls; The Little Drummer Boy; Silent Night; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and We Wish You a Merry Christmas.<br>???<br>THE Christmas record remains. In London in 1989 I received three copies of Peter Carey's wonderful book Oscar and Lucinda. Two came from Britain and one from Australia.<br>This year I opened three copies of American humorist Bill Bryson's witty travelogue Notes From a Small Island. The only difference was that one was from Britain and two from Australia.<br></font></p>
