            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CARLTON has shattered a few myths with its amazing run to Saturday's AFL grand final.<br>Who can now really believe this is a silvertail club? One glaring piece of evidence put that one out to pasture before the ball was even bounced in last Saturday's extraordinary preliminary final.<br>That was the appearance of club president John Elliott on the Footy Show.<br>He turned up at least 20 minutes late and had obviously had a good lunch.<br>But he wasn't going to mouth off. Ron Barassi, John Nicholls and Alex Jesaulenko had told him to keep a low profile and refrain from his notorious outbursts.<br>So Elliott did not have an outburst. He just kept rambling on, occasionally got stuck into Dermott Brereton, pushed Sam Newman off his chair, mumbled that he had stolen John Worsfold from the Eagles, interrupted Newman when he tried to send get-well wishes to Brisbane president Alan Piper ... that is, he took over the show.<br>The performance did not emphasise Elliott's class, although it did so for a word that rhymes with it.<br>The Carlton players are not silvertails either, but for very different reasons and anyway, it is unfair to place the Elliott yoke around them.<br>It was not grace, skill and class that pushed the Blues to a one-point win over the hotly favoured Essendon.<br>It was work, manual labour, grunt, guts, heart ... words not synonymous with silvertails, but given a human face by the likes of Brett Ratten, Fraser Brown, Dean Rice and skinny, little Matthew Lappin.<br>Above all there was Anthony Koutoufides.<br>Now, a little personal evidence about Carlton not being silvertails.<br>In 1995, I watched Carlton thrash Geelong by 10 goals in the grand final.<br>I was seated just in front of a standing-room only area in the Great Southern Stand. This particular area was built like a cage. The inmates rattling the bars were Carlton supporters.<br>It was easy to tell because they had only three words in their vocabulary - three that can be printed anyway.<br>The words were Kouta, awesome and Diesel.<br>Next Saturday, they will be able to use only two of those words, and only if the Kangaroos let Koutoufides into the game.<br>Talk about Carlton not being silvertails, what about the mad, straight-running, brutal Roos?<br>And if they allow their runner to shepherd as he did against Brisbane's Steve Lawrence last Friday night, it could be over very quickly for the Blues.<br>A Roos premiership would give the team, formerly known as North Melbourne, two premierships in the 90s, equalling the feats of West Coast and Adelaide.<br>But will it make them the team of the 90s as Melbourne-based myth suggests?<br>Cold, hard stats might shatter that one. West Coast won 64.6 per cent of its matches from 1990 to now compared with the Kangaroos' 61.3 per cent.<br>And the grand final tip - Kangaroos by 54 points. But remember this comes from a column that tipped West Coast to win the second derby this year by six goals.<br></font></p>
