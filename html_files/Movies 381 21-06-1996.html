            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">That Eye, The Sky (M)<br>Peter Coyote, Lisa Harrow, Jamie Croft<br>Directed by John Ruane<br>? ? ? ?<br>IF WE go to the cinema to see Sly Stallone, Arnie Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis or Jean-Claude van Damme chances are we go with about one per cent of our brain functioning.<br>Chances also are we enjoy mindless mayhem, popcorn, unhealthy drinks and an escape from what we think of as the real world.<br>Mainstream cinema gives us good times for sure, but mostly rubbish. It is junk-food, takeaway culture, if so high-minded a word can be used.<br>Every now and then something pops up that requires some thought and more emotion than just cheap thrills. It also requires we use more than the 10 per cent of the brains scientists say we use in normal daily living.<br>That Eye, The Sky is a cinematic experience requiring such effort; not because it is an intellectual heavyweight but because it challenges more than just the frontal lobes (which are our seats of pleasure) and asks viewers to feel to the depths of their souls.<br>It is a beautiful, at times too slow, charming, challenging and always moving film, based on the third novel of Tim Winton, who I believe is the greatest Australian author to draw breath.<br>That Eye, The Sky has been released at the cinema before - just last year - and then quickly on video. Just as quickly it is back on the big screen where it is 110 minutes of worthy pleasure.<br>Winton's story, brought wonderfully to the screen by John Ruane (who was responsible for the far different but equally as good Death in Brunswick), concerns life through the eyes of 12-year-old Morton (Ort for short).<br>Ort (beautifully played by Jamie Croft) loves his dad Sam and his isolated bush life; but appears to love his chook Errol the most. His life (and that of his struggling family) is turned on its head when Sam has a serious car accident and lands in a vegetative coma; life seeping slowly from his useless body.<br>Sam (Mark Fairall) is a child of the 1960s and has been struggling in the bush for years in an alternative lifestyle with his lovely wife Alice (Lisa Harrow). In their house is also Sam's mum, ?Grammar?, who is ga ga and needs constant help. To complicate matters there is the ravishingly beautiful teenage daughter Tegwyn (Amanda Douge) fully equipped with adolescent confusion, rebellion and hormones to go.<br>The vegetation of handsome-go-lucky and loving Sam could not have come at a worse time for this family. Poor Alice, surprisingly unlined considering her sunburnt and tough bush life, now has to cope with two invalids, a sullen teenager and a full-of-beans boy who sees strange lights.<br>But enter a stranger. Henry Warburton (Peter Coyote) is a mystical wanderer and self-proclaimed healer.<br>He takes the family by the scruff of the neck and tries to bring Christian faith and a New Age mystical belief in faith and miracles. He becomes the man about the house, doing the heavy work, becoming Ort's idol, Tegwyn's target of resentment and Alice's right hand. He even bathes Sam in scenes of touching beauty.<br>But Henry is just a man for all that with a typical man's failings. He has a violent streak and in the end shows his feet are very much made of clay when it comes to sex and ravishing blondes with sultry eyes.<br>The onus for healing the rapidly deteriorating Sam falls back on little Ort and the strange light that comes from his companion, the sky.<br>It is a beautiful parable of love, life and the next world that could make your head ache if you wanted a brainless night out.<br>Otherwise it is one of the loveliest Australian films made and deserves more than a short arthouse run before going video again.<br>The cinematography directed by Ellery Ryan gives the bush the stark beauty of a Streeton landscape.<br></font></p>
