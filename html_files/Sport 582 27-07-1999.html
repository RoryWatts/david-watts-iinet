            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE next two episodes of Great Expectations will make enthralling viewing.<br>Those who thought the ABC adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic finished on Sunday night are correct.<br>But the Channel 7 version for supporters of the Eagles and Dockers is still running.<br>The first episode next weekend will be shown on Saturday night under the title ?Surely the Eagles are not that bad?.<br>The sub-title is ?They couldn't lose to Collingwood ... could they ... no seriously?.<br>A less dramatic but equally important episode will screen at noon on Sunday.<br>It is called ?Dockers say farewell to 15th spot?.<br>The old script for Great Expectations went like this back in June, just after the Kangaroos had beaten the Eagles by 20 points - win the next five, put down the Brisbane game at the Gabba as a 50-50 bet, thump Collingwood, give Essendon a fright but probably lose, then win the next three to finish first or second with the certain prospect of two home finals.<br>Richmond did not like that script and Fremantle thought it stank.<br>Brisbane just laughed and tore it up.<br>The new script is available strictly on a week-by-week basis.<br>But if fans of Great Expectations had listened to Mick Malthouse properly all year, instead of being beguiled by the six-nil start, they might have been prepared for some changes in plot.<br>After West Coast thrashed Essendon by 74 points in round four, he said the club was still on a rebuilding program.<br>Not too much should be expected of it yet.<br>Bomber coach Kevin Sheedy retorted: ?I think Mick's a great comic.?<br>Even after his team defeated Geelong in round 13, and was still on top of the ladder, Malthouse refused to join the ranks of Great Expectations followers.<br>?Let's worry about the eight before worrying about how many wins it takes to make the top four,? he said.<br>And now the plot centres on whether the Eagles can beat Collingwood, the last-placed side; Collingwood which has not beaten West Coast in Perth since 1992 (though that was at the WACA ground).<br>History might help viewers understand the next Eagles episode better.<br>How does the club react after a thrashing?<br>After its biggest loss - by 142 points to Essendon in 1989 - it won the next three straight.<br>After the 130-point loss to Sydney in 1987 it won the next four out of six.<br>Under Malthouse, in the 1992 premiership year, it scored only 3.11 when losing to St Kilda by 66 points in round 18 but then won the next three in a row, including a 131-point slaughter of Brisbane.<br>In 1995, its worst defeat of 62 points was inflicted by North in round 18, but it won the next three of four.<br>Importantly, after succumbing to North, it kicked 26.21 while rampaging over Adelaide by 135 points in the very next game.<br>If other sub-plots work this weekend - Richmond beats the Kangaroos, and Carlton defeats the Bulldogs - West Coast could even be in second spot ... provided it beats Collingwood. And a Fremantle win might lift it as high as 12th.<br>How's that for Great Expectations?<br></font></p>
