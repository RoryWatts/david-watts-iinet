            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AWARDS<br>The Muddies - world's ugliest sites<br>www.netstudio.com/mudbrick/<br>THE winners of the Muddies, one of the Web's most dubious awards, will be announced next Tuesday.<br>Visitors to graphic software maker NetStudio have been voting for the ugliest site on the Web over the past few months. NetStudio has boiled down the votes to just a few finalists now, and boy are they horrible.<br>The Muddies, or more correctly the Mud Brick Awards, are regarded as a tongue-in-cheek salute to HTML design. NetStudio says they represent a view of the medium that is ?as painful as root canal treatment?.<br>?The awards aim to expose the Web's unprofessional-looking Web sites, especially those of big businesses who should know better,? said one NetStudio executive.<br>In the Big Businesses Who Should Know Better category, Pizza Hut, Quaker Oats and Southwest Airlines have earned dishonourable mentions such as: ?About as appetising as a broccoli and lima bean pizza.?<br>?An embarrassing site for a corporation that is a household name. Looks like a high school project.?<br>PERTH<br>Guide to WA<br>perthinter.net<br>THIS portal for Perth, in fact any WA Web site, is gathering some steam. It is fast and easily navigated with scores of categories and sites.<br>The site allows surfers to check the weather, look at up-to-date pictures through a Webcam, find out what's on TV and browse the White Pages before offering its menu of goodies.<br>These include TV, radio, sport, nightlife, education and shopping.<br>ENVIRONMENT<br>World Wildlife Fund: the Amazon<br>worldwildlife.org/amazon/<br>THE World Wildlife Fund has found a novel way to use the Web to highlight the fragility of the Amazon rainforest.<br>It has teamed with mega online book site Amazon.com to provide a highly informative and literate bag of resources.<br>The aim is to raise awareness and money to safeguard the Amazon basin. The Amazon is the world's richest rainforest, and, according to the WWF ?the world's premier example of the delicate web of life?.<br>FUN<br>Official Rock, Paper, Scissors Strategy Guide<br>www.worldrps.com/index1.html<br>THE World Rock, Papers, Scissors Society takes the much-played game very seriously. Then again maybe it has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek at this site.<br>You can decide for yourself when you check out the detailed graphics accompanied by text such as: ?Rock, Paper, Scissors has captivated the minds, and hands, of generations of decision-makers across the world. Whether you are a budding novice or a seasoned veteran, this is the page for you (the only page, we might add, to be completely dedicated to the strategy and tactics of this king of all pasttimes).?<br>Enough said.<br></font></p>
