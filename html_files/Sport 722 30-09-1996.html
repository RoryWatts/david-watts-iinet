            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A CHURCH in Perth used to have a placard out the front saying: ?The best thing about miracles is that they sometimes do happen?.<br>Midway through the second quarter of the AFL grand final it looked like Sydney would prove this. The Swans had put the cold steel up North Melbourne and the Roos did not like it.<br>Their stars Wayne Carey and Corey McKernan were strangely missing and Troy Luff looked like running riot giving the Swans a goal-scoring avenue to match the one being provided by Tony Lockett.<br>Then Sydney captain Paul Kelly uncharacteristically over-finessed inside 50m and his pass to Lockett missed its mark and was swept away to the other end of the ground.<br>The Roos never looked back and ended up winning easily - an all-too-familiar grand final result. The Sydney fairytale ended and the Melbourne-based core of the AFL could sigh with relief that no interstate intruder had snatched the centenary flag.<br>As a television spectacle it was hard to beat. Not only did the great game have a worthy contest (if only for the first half), but the entertainment beforehand and Channel 7's actual coverage were exemplary.<br>The extent to which TV coverage has improved can be measured by comparing coverage of the 1977 tied grand final between North and Collingwood and Saturday's centenary.<br>Seven's Football Marathon late on Friday night started with this thrilling game, and even though it was played only 19 years ago, it was remarkable to see how much practically everything has changed - mostly for the better.<br>The actual game is faster and more frenetic, footballers are physically fitter and stronger - and better groomed.<br>And the much-maligned commentary is much more comprehensive.<br>Instead of Lou Richards' radio-style, machine-gun delivery reminding us of the score every 40 seconds, there is now a tag team of voices (some good, some bad); interspersed on Saturday with the knowledgeable comments of Leigh Matthews, a great thinker about the game.<br>The cameras cover from everywhere and even Robert DiPierdomenico is actually very useful, letting the viewer know the extent of injuries and coaching stress. In 1977 it was a guessing game by comparison.<br>Watching the grand final on TV with a group of a dozen or so in Perth was fun, spiced up with a sweep on the result which ensured that barracking was ruled by the wallet and not the heart.<br>Nearly everyone wanted the Swans to win, but no one picked them. And when the Roos got 30 points up, at least half the crowd I was with started cheering madly.<br>We all had North by five goals or more. Only a miracle would have changed our minds.<br></font></p>
