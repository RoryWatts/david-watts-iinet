            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE'S five-year dominance of the Web browser market is over, according to latest figures from a statistics site that claims to analyse the habits of 10 million surfers a day.<br>StatMarket, an offshoot of the Webside Story organisation in the US, says that last week nearly 70 per cent of the people who visited 25,000 monitored sites used Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>Only 29 per cent used Netscape.<br>StatMarket figures - which measure a wide variety of Net-related activity - also confirmed Microsoft's thumping dominance of the desktop. Microsoft operating systems were used by nearly 95 per cent of surfers. Macintosh, with just under 3 per cent, was a distant second.<br>Figures at several other sites which measure browser market share, such as Browserwatch, have charted Microsoft's steady rise since the release of version 3.0 of Internet Explorer in August 1996.<br>But none has registered the sort of dominance that StatMarket's figures suggest. Last week Browserwatch, which measures visits to its sites from about 100,000 people a week, said Netscape had 43 per cent to Microsoft's 40 per cent.<br>What all have measured is Netscape's decline from 1995 when it had more than 80 per cent of the market.<br>The release of IE 3.0 made some inroads, but it was IE 4.0, and the bundling of it with Windows operating systems, that did most damage to Netscape.<br>Now the release of IE 5.0 earlier this year has further weakened Netscape's once-towering position. More than 12 per cent of people are using IE 5.0 already, despite the fact that it has added few innovations to the popular version 4.0.<br>StatMarket, whose data runs to such trivia as the most-used screen resolutions and colour settings, confirms Australia's position as one of the most connected countries in the world.<br>Figures showing the leading foreign domains for Net access put Australia in sixth position. It ranks just behind more populous nations, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and France. And connections from Australia's .au domain outrank those from domains in Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland.<br>StatMarket was launched in late January after a period of beta testing in the US last year.<br>Its parent, WebSideStory, rates itself as a leader in Internet traffic analysis, traffic building and user trends.<br>WebSide Story executives say StatMarket is a dynamically updated site devoted to demographic and computing data. This is collected from more than 25,000 Web sites and 10 million visitors a day. The big sample size, probably the biggest tested on the Web so far, is expected to continue to grow.<br>WebSide Story says its data is the most accurate on the Web because it is gathered from information supplied by actual site visitors, mostly unaware of the monitoring, rather than from targeted sample groups.<br>StatMarket Web site figures<br>(All show percentage of total use):<br>Browser breakdown (top 5)<br>MSIE            4.x 49.02<br>Netscape        4.x 25.57<br>MSIE            5.x 12.65<br>MSIE            3.x 5.39<br>Netscape Top 10 search engines<br>Yahoo      47.38<br>Excite     17.82<br>AltaVista  10.30<br>Infoseek   6.07<br>MSN        3.36<br>WebCrawler 2.99<br>HotBot     2.83<br>Snap       2.56<br>Goto       2.40<br>Lycos      2.39<br>OS breakdown<br>Windows 95    45.04<br>Windows 98    42.44<br>Windows NT    5.58<br>Macintosh     2.79<br>WebTV         1.74<br>Windows 3.x   1.17<br>Other         0.61<br>Linux         0.21<br>Sun SunOS     0.17<br>Silicon IRIX  0.04<br>Operating systems<br>Windows    94.28<br>Macintosh  2.79<br>Other      2.41<br>Unix       0.52<br>Web browsers<br>Microsoft   69.26<br>Netscape    28.92<br>Other       1.81<br>Plug-ins<br>LiveAudio     11.99<br>QuickTime     11.32<br>AVI           10.89<br>Flash         8.50<br>Media Player  5.42<br>Shockwave     4.75<br>Beatnik       4.61<br>Acrobat       4.28<br>RealPlayer    G23.31<br>Cosmo         1.02.34<br>Foreign domains<br>Japan         22.28<br>Germany       14.65<br>UK            6.25<br>Canada        5.77<br>France        5.06<br>Australia     4.79<br>Sweden        3.45<br>Italy         3.05<br>Netherlands   2.14<br>Switzerland   2<br>Helpdesk<br>Market:www.statmarket.com<br>Hitbox::www.hitbox.com<br>Browserwatch:www.browserwatch.com<br></font></p>
