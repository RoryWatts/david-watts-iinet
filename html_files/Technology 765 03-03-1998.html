            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">midistudio.com<br>If you like your music on the synthesized side then you'll be in heaven at MIDI Studio Consortium, home of MIDI practitioners Don Carroll, Gary Wachtel and Mel Webb. The MIDI studio is a well laid out site with a series of ?floors? (well, pages) where you can listen to guest artists, find out about hardware and software, chat in the coffeeshop or just search out a MIDI version of a favourite tune. In the Rooftop Look & Listen Lounge you can listen to a MIDI tune while watching ripples on a lovely lake, one of several pictures that has been altered using the Lakes Applet. Many of the MIDI works (found in the Basement) are in the public domain and are free to download for personal use. Styles range from Latin to pop to showtunes. The site is available in English and Spanish and will soon be available in French and Italian. (SY)<br>Motown at 40<br>www.motownat40.com<br>If you are of the right age and temperament, this site is one of the best the Web has produced in its short, dynamic history. The Detroit Free Press newspaper is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the motor city's biggest contribution to modern culture, Motown Records.<br>And what a lot of goodies it has provided. Apart from a history of the recording studio responsible for making black music so popular, there are biographies and discographies of the stars. But the biggest highlight - and you must have RealPlayer audio to enjoy it - is the top 40 hit chart from 1958-71. A 30-second excerpt from each song can be played online, making for a good dose of nostalgia while you listen to Heard it Through the Grapevine, Baby Love, My Girl etc etc. (DW)<br>Fun Things To Do While Waiting For A Disaster<br>theepicenter.com/fun.html<br>You don't really have to be waiting for a disaster to visit this site. Boredom would be one reason, the need for a laugh another. This page has links to the wild, the wacky, the weird. From the amazing dancing baby to UFO sightings to electronic etch-a-sketch to the world's first bat house on the Internet - hours of distraction are guaranteed. It also has a list of ?strange devices connected to the Net? such as the automatic talking machine. Those with an eye to the future might prefer to follow the link to the Magic 8 Ball online. With the real version you ask it a question, shake it, and it reveals the answer. Online, you click a button for a random answer. As anyone who has ever consulted a Magic 8 ball will tell you, it never lies. (SY)<br>Notes & Queries<br>nq.guardian.co.uk<br>The meaning of life may be here, but no one can agree on it. This site is run by the Guardian newspaper in London and is an online version of one of its best regular features. Readers pose questions and other readers propose answers. Often the answers lead to verbal violence, particularly in this online version which allows rapid publication of e-mail opinions. The sort of questions posed cover a huge variety of topics from medicine to sport and entertainment. But all in all it is mostly just fascinating trivia. (DW)<br>Alki Baby Namer<br>www.babynamer.com<br>Don't be put off by the fact that this is an American site. They are not all Billy-Bobs and Becky-Sues. In fact, they have pretty normal names and you can find out their meaning, roots, pronunciation, derivatives and place in the popularity stakes. Obviously it is intended for expectant parents, who can search through indices of names, or type in a name in a search window. But it is fun for those who like to stock their heads with useless information like: David was the sixth most popular name among US males in 1990. (DW)<br>BestBits Guide<br>www.iinet.net.au/ ~ntt/<br>Nick Takayama of Perth has set himself a mission from which we could all benefit. He is monitoring computer hardware retailers around the metropolitan area - initially those with Web sites - to draw up lists of the cheapest available prices. He does not pretend that this site is a bible of recommended hardware but simply a guide to prices. So if you are in the market for a printer, motherboard, scanner, modem, etc, BestBits is well worth a look. (DW)<br>Eurofield Information Services<br>www.eis.com.au<br>At first glance this site looks a little dull, full of text and bearing a very straightforward title. But the goodies available are wonderful. Simple downloads and installations enable the surfer to have a King James version of the Bible, the MegaLex version of the Macquarie Concise Dictionary and a copy of the Australian Constitution on their hard disks.The MegaLex dictionary integrates with Microsoft Word documents. A click on the word you want to search for (for either meaning or spelling or both) in your word processor fires up the dictionary.The Easy-Verse KJV Bible is billed as the world's smallest compressed and fully indexed electronic Bible. It takes up 1.4Mb of disk space and is entirely searchable. The demo free version available here has only some of the Gospels but is otherwise fully operational.And the Constitution ? you have heard a lot about it this year, so here is a chance to be more informed about all the hot air that was expelled in Canberra. It may be a weighty tome in terms of importance but the Constitution will take only 500K of disk space. (DW)<br></font></p>
