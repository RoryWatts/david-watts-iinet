            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It was December 1995. A gorgeous Perth summer's day; 27 degrees, light sea breeze, no clouds. The place: the WACA ground. Michael Slater was giving the then Test cricket minnows Sri Lanka a batting lesson.<br>All in all it was perfect, the sort of day on which you could rightly say: ?You wouldn't be dead for quids.?<br>You could also rightly say it was a massive waste of time - but what a nice way to waste time.<br>That was only weeks before I discovered an even better way to waste time ? the World Wide Web.<br>Among the hundreds of millions of Web pages are those - often Java-driven - that can make one forget real life totally, for 30 minutes at least.<br>They are the time-wasters of a switched-on society, and more power to them. If you cannot waste time properly, you obviously have no sense of its value.<br>At this time of the year it is easy to guess what is on the minds of most blokes my age ? the footy finals.<br>And a great place to waste time is the AFL Final Eight Calculator. Its value lies in the fact that the McIntyre final eight system is so maddeningly hard to work out.<br>In the first weekend - that is the one coming, be warned non-footy followers - first plays eighth, second plays seventh, third confronts sixth and fourth takes on fifth.<br>The headaches start in the second week when the highest-placed winners take time off, the next highest play the highest placed losers and some of it has to happen in Melbourne and some doesn't and you end up with the number you first thought of.<br>As for week three, forget it ? unless you surf along to the final eight calculator.<br>Here you simply enter the teams as drawn for this weekend's matches, check a button next to the likely winners, and the draw for the next week appears.Check the likely winners again and on it goes right up to the final box containing the names of the grand finalists (no winner is prophesied).<br>By checking the boxes of your choice, you can create any number of combinations for the big day - West Coast v Geelong, Adelaide v Sydney, Bulldogs v St Kilda and on and on.<br>In Perth, the very sporty Web site of Andrew Dare has more answers for people who find the final eight a chore. He has created files for Excel users that, in his words, ?show how the b... final eight works?.This work has been inspired by the final eight calculator.<br>If footy is not your thing then there are dozens of other ways to waste time ? although with these sites it might be better to say kill time.<br>It is possible if you are in the right depressed frame of mind to have a clock on-screen displaying how much time you have left to live. And it keeps on ticking down as you watch it. Very jolly.The main Death Clock on the Web comes framed by an image of the Grim Reaper and links to wills and obituaries, among other things.<br>Key in your date of birth and sex and a Java display will show a readout of your estimated date of departure from this mortal coil plus a digital clock counting down to the fatal moment.<br>Another version of the clock at Shadowmag, a site that appears to deal in UFOs, follows the same formula, but, when I tried it, the clock gave me five more years than the Death Clock site.<br>If all that is a bit macabre, you can always cheer yourself up at the Random Joke Site that selects from a growing database of funnies that include blonde jokes, blue jokes, any jokes at all really.<br>Be warned, you can be on the receiving end of a dirty joke. There is no way to be sure.<br>HELP DESK<br>AFL Final Eight Calculator: www.cyntax.com.au/final8/finals.htm<br>Andrew Dare's page: www.iinet.net.au/ ~dare/<br>Death Clock: www.deathclock.com<br>Shadowmag death clock: www.shadowmag.com/death/<br>death.html<br>Random Jokes: jokes.webdevelop.com/<br></font></p>
