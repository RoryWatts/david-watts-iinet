            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE longer you live the more cynical you become.<br>There are a lot of wise old sayings meant to make us feel better about ourselves, but in a world that appears to become madder by the minute you have to question how wise they really are.<br>An Internet correspondent, known as Garfield, recently passed on the following:The journey of 1000km begins with a broken fan belt and a leaky tyre.We are born naked, wet and hungry. Then things get worse.Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.Pain and suffering is inevitable but misery is optional.<br>These realities are rammed home when we think of politicians. Here in WA we are watching Premier Richard Court realise that no amount of bell towers, convention centres or maritime museums means SFA to those affected by the RFA.<br>Prime Minister John Howard and Democrats leader Meg Lees have turned themselves and their so-called principles inside out to bring us a new tax. Accountants and lawyers are smiling. Everyone else is just dazed, bored or more cynical.<br>US President Bill Clinton is trying to give the world something other than Monica Lewinsky to remember him by. He is thrusting his alternatively grim and smiling face into peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. According to Middle East expert Robert Fisk on the ABC's Foreign Correspondent this week, neither side needs Mr Clinton there. But how do they tell him? He's got the bombs and CNN, after all.<br>By the way, did you know that Mr Clinton's affair of the smoking trousers with Ms Lewinsky has legitimised oral sex as a pastime among America's young teenagers?<br>The Washington Post reported this month that parents of half those in a Year 8 class at a suburban high school had had to be counselled because the kids were holding regular oral sex parties. Most of them said they did not equate what they were doing with real sex or intimacy and felt if it was all right for the President, it was all right for them.<br>Into this cynical world of politics - in the US at least - has come some sense at last. Newspaper columnist Dave Barry, who once wrote in this very space, has announced he will run for President next year.<br>BARRY has entered the race with great style by opening a site on the World Wide Web of the Internet to put his case. How can he be resisted with this slogan: ?Every now and then, America produces a great leader - a person of vision, courage, and integrity. Until that leader shows up, why not elect Dave Barry as our President??<br>Barry promises to serve average Americans and make their lives better . . . ?unless you're one of those people who make or receive mobile phone calls inside movie theatres, in which case Dave Barry thinks you should be killed with a hatchet?.<br>And he has some original views on major issues.<br>Crime - "I favour the death penalty for everything. In the case of really, really bad criminals - especially murderers and whoever is responsible for putting Jerry Springer on television - I support a massive government project to develop a way to bring them back to life after we execute them, so we can execute them again.?<br>Education - "I believe that American schoolchildren should be given standardised national educational tests, and I will tell you exactly why: because I am not a schoolchild. I am strongly in favour of things that I, personally, do not have to do. Childbirth is another example.?<br>Health - "Our number one health-care priority must be to make the medical profession find some way to get to the prostate gland other than the way they're getting to it now.?<br>That is his bottom line.<br></font></p>
