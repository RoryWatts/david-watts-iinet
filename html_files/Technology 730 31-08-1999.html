            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHARITY<br>Variety Club of WA Bash<br>www.varietywa.asn.au<br>THE Variety Club of WA set out on its annual Bash to raise money for charity last week. We on the Web can follow the bashees' progress and learn a lot more about one of WA's best traditions along the way.<br>An interactive map at the Bash site allows surfers to hover the mouse over the Kalbarri-Karratha route for daily updates.<br>Click on a designated spot and you will be informed of progress, terrain, mishaps with cars etc. The Variety Club also has plenty of news at the site about its aims, Bash teams and the sponsors who keep such a fun activity going.<br>Since the first WA Bash in 1989, more than $6 million has been raised by teams of people who are happy to give up time and money to drive pre-1965 cars through a lot of normally inhospitable territory.<br>COMMUNITY ACTION<br>Leighton Action Coalition<br>www.freo.com/leighton/<br>THE Web is starting to come into its own as a focal point for community action. This is well demonstrated at the Leighton Action Coalition's site.<br>The coalition is concerned at development plans being drawn up for the Leighton marshalling yards, south of Cottesloe and Mosman Park.<br>It wants this valuable area of land to be natural and rehabilitated dunes and parkland, not a private housing development that restricts public access to the beach.<br>The coalition's site spells out its views, complete with pictures, explains its vision, the issues, community concepts for the area, a plan of its own, plus events aimed at raising awareness. Feedback areas advocating that people write, phone, fax and e-mail politicians about the issue are also included.<br>HEALTH<br>Cancer Foundation of WA<br>www.cancerwa.asn.au<br>THE Cancer Foundation of WA is using the Web to help pursue its stated aim of minimising the effect of cancer on the community through research and education.<br>Its site serves as a knowledge base for anyone in the State affected by cancer, their families, or simply for people who want to remain informed about a modern scourge. The site is stacked with useful information about support for sufferers, palliative care, education, fund-raising, research and links to goods aimed at cancer prevention.<br></font></p>
