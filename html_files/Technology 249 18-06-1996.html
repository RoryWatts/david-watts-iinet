            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE enthusiasm West Australians have for the World Wide Web is evident in two new, quite different sites.<br>Both are directories of purely WA Web sites.<br>If you can say something as young as the Internet has a tradition then the WA Web Index is following that with its straightforward presentation of sites.<br>Developed by I.T. Business Solutions and Bit-Media, the index allows surfers to call up a list of new sites submitted to the index in the past week or so. Each site has its name and a small synopsis written by the person who submitted it.<br>Bit-Media is using it as a showcase for some of its own sites in these early days, but there is a growing variety.<br>At a time when gun owners are being shot to pieces it is interesting to see an online petition calling for legalisation of paintball - the mock shoot-em-up game - in WA.<br>The petition has been signed via e-mail by hundreds of people from around the world, many asking is WA serious in not allowing what they consider a harmless recreation.<br>The other new directory is vastly different. WA@RANDOM, developed by E Media, operates like a roulette wheel, except that you click ?go? and never know exactly where you will end up.<br>The one certainty is that it will be at a WA site. In only a few weeks WA@RANDOM has attracted nearly 800 submissions. There is a good scattering of E Media-related sites, but plenty of others.<br>URLs:<br>WA Web Index<br>www.bitme.com.au/wawi/<br>WA@RANDOM<br>www.emedia.com.au/random/<br></font></p>
