            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE newest, flashiest technology failed to make an impact on election night.<br>The Internet, with its reputation for rapid global communications, did not keep pace with the tally.<br>Trumpeted as a glimpse into how future election nights might be covered on home computers, both attempts at live Net coverage were about as revolutionary as waiting for Sunday papers.<br>Live Net coverage was offered at the ABC's election site to complement its comprehensive television coverage.<br>It was also at a site called Netcetera, which has had a distinguished electronic campaign as a site for virtual voting.<br>Early indications were that live Net coverage was as good as TV, particularly for expatriates overseas.<br>As Maxine McKew read the first results from rural NSW about 3.35pm, they appeared on the Net.<br>But within 45 minutes, Net users took up to four attempts before they could read results - if there were any.<br>When the ABC team started to rattle off early Victorian figures, they had not been posted on the Net.<br>Things were no better when Queensland results became available on TV.<br>But at 5.15pm, it was possible to click on a selection called the Big Picture and get a graph showing how many seats were going to whom.<br>When WA seats appeared on TV about 6.30pm, not one was on the Net.<br>But users accessing results shortly after this were greeted by an announcement: 9.30 Keating concedes defeat.<br>At Netcetera, no results were posted until after 6pm.<br>As an experiment, live Internet coverage was a failure, but given the rapid rate of change in Net technology, it will possibly be a big player in 1999.<br></font></p>
