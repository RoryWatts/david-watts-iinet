            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">twenty-something<br>Vanessa Gould<br>MUSIC<br>I Get Around, The Beachboys (1978). For some reason, the first single I ever bought I thought would be the ?Round, round, get around, I get around ...? variety. I think I got dudded and ended up with imitation Beach Boys. The excitement of buying my first record as a young kiddie soon faded and left me feeling like the music-dork in desperate need of education that I remain today.<br>The Theme From Rocky (1979). It must have seemed a little odd, now that I think of it, to see a demure 11 year old with long hair and an enormous pink bow, mushroom floral dress and burgundy suede shoes (my first Italian pair) trying to belt out the big, bad, trumpetting theme from Rocky. Another Yamaha organ festival, another humiliation. Played it to perfection, complicated trills and all - except so quietly, the judges couldn't hear it. Came second to a big clumsy, LOUD, rendition of the moronicly soppy ?Paper Roses?.<br>I Was Made For Lovin' You, Kiss (1980). I covered an entire family-room wall with Paul Stanley posters. Those ruby-red pouted lips! At the great Kiss social of grade 6/7, I was sure my blue disco-suit and pony-tail on the side of my head would win the affections of my school-heart throb - who, naturally, was painted as Paul Stanley. Paul ended up with a friend of mine, I got to kiss Gene Simmonds.<br>Me Myself I, Joan Armatrading (1982). She was soooo cool. A big loud-around the house song that filled up our great family house, full of light and ocean views and Zoe the fox terrier basking in sunlight. Made cleaning and stuff like that bearable.<br>Come on Eileen, Dexy's Midnight Runners (1983). Year nine school socials. Pure, kissing-at-the-back-of-the-gym, flirting on the dance-floor stuff. Great, great funny memories.<br>Meat is Murder, The Smiths (1985). The title track of Meat is Murder, and the groaning synthesised cow, always takes me back to flying out of Australia for the first time on my own, about 15 or 16, going on a French exchange trip to La Reunion island with a group of schoolies from around the state. Blissfully unaware of the culture shock and stunning experiences which lay ahead.<br>Human Frailty (album). Hunters and Collectors (1985). LOUD, always made me think of being on holidays, with friends, in Kalbarri, school ending. That yi-harrrr love-life feeling.<br>Solitude Standing, (album) Suzanne Vega (1987). So delicate, strong, and strange, all in one. A great story teller who transports with beautiful or sad urban fairy-tales.<br>Welcome to the Boomtown, David and David (1987). Very sentimental memories take me back to first year at St George's residential college, uni, moving to Perth, first love, first taste of true freedom and responsibility.<br>Miss Free Love of 69, Hoodoo Gurus (1992). For memories of one perfect, unplanned birthday party a few years back which went from lunch to dinner.<br>thirty-something<br>Helen Crompton<br>Son of a Preacher Man, Dusty Springfield (1964). Typhoo tea had an offer which I got my parents to check out (my best writing then took up one foot per word). Got a plastic heart-shaped frame and pic of Dusty. Confused ever since about religion and sex.<br>Waterloo Sunset, The Kinks (1969). Chester. My brother Phil had all The Stones (plus rare US versions) and The Kinks. Urban poets. Later in London, Waterloo Station and this song made me feel at home.<br>I Heard It Through the Gravevine, Marvin Gaye (1971). First vinyl single with appalling diarrhoea-coloured sleeve. Learned to put my hand on my hip and let my backbone slip, thanks to Marv and Pan's People.<br>Superstition, Stevie Wonder (1973). Boarding school parties. About as wild as cardboard. This was played as a highlight. Grooves on dancefloor with no one to impress except ourselves. Tragic.<br>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Elton John (1974). The sixth form common room window promised ... boys. Illicit ones. Best sort. Met a French exchange student at same. He had a big nose and straggly blond hair. I was fully prepared for Gerard Depardieu.<br>Because the Night, Patti Smith (1979). Uni days. Met first love who gave me his political admin notes - still owe him. Thought I presented a cool image of disinterested sophistication pretty brilliantly. Written by US people's poet Springsteen.<br>Centrefold, J. Geils Band (1982). Stoke-on-Trent, now an English teacher. Also worked in miners pub where fights broke out at Christmas. One woman bit off a rival's ear last time I pulled a pint as the thinking man's Bette Lynch.<br>Cover Me, Bruce Springsteen (1982 (4)). I saw the Boss twice this year, once at Wembley because I fibbed saying I was a music correspondent. From this track I could tell that Bruce and I were soul mates.<br>Miss Freelove '69, Hoodoo Gurus (1993). Fremantle, free love - not, because the boyfriend was out of work and it cost me a fortune to keep us in beer to forget the fact. If you do the swim to this after three Coopers you need not regret missing the 60s.<br>Heaven, Talking Heads, Iva Davies version (1996). Track played in trendy friendly restaurant with artist's name in Hamilton, Victoria, on what turned out to be my third honeymoon (same husband). It's just a feeling isn't it? ?Everyone's trying to get to the bar. The name of the bar is Heaven.? Surreal, romantic and nothing can replace it.<br>forty-something<br>David Watts<br>Little Boy Lost, Johnny Ashcroft (first heard about 1960). The wild New England ranges where the little boy was lost were only 160km south of where I lived and similar to the bush around our town. At five years of age the prospect of getting lost in that bush kept me awake at night and the words ?where's my daddy, cried the little boy lost? made me feel very close to my own dad.<br>Itchycoo Park, The Small Faces (1967). I was 13, voice was deepening, hair sprouting in new places and I wanted to be cool and sharp. This song brought hippiedom and images of free love to our short back and sides town and the promise of a different, more exciting world.<br>The Real Thing, Russell Morris (1969). My friends and I just couldn't believe it. Psychedelic, long, involved, catchy and what's more Australian, we rang radio stations to request it all the time. Couldn't get enough of the oom maa maa moww moww etc.<br>Stairway to Heaven, Led Zeppelin (1974). Marijuana and fantasy worlds very different to what Walt Disney envisaged were all the rage and Zeppelin caught them perfectly with this silly but significant work. Jimmy Page's guitar work still beats in my head when I'm in the shower and I also pretend I'm Robert Plant with the awesome voice.<br>Born to Run, Bruce Springsteen (1975). I'd moved away from home, was feeling my oats and ready to do everything I'd been told I couldn't. Springsteen spoke to me. It was like a dream. He's still right up there as one of my favourites.<br>And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda, the Bushwhackers (1978). About the same time I discovered Peter Carey I also warmed to the work of Lawson and Paterson. Music to go with this Australiana came perfectly from the Bushwhackers who were a sensational live band. Their rendition of this Eric Bogle tune makes me want to cry and it makes me proud to be Australian ... to temper chauvinism with the experience of humanity.<br>Blue Valentine, Tom Waites (1979). In Melbourne I went through a blue time, drank too much, pondered life too much and there to muse with me was the gravelly voice of Waites. Wish I could sing like that.<br>Cheap Wine, Cold Chisel (1980). Raw Australian rock. I just loved it. It had no pretensions.<br>Russians, Sting (1985). My wife was pregnant with our first child and Sting made me think just how precious children are ... you never think about it until it happens to you.<br>Nessum Dorma, Luciano Pavarotti (1990). Took me away from rock and pop, which at 35 I was enjoying less, and made me appreciate opera. Still trying to adjust to this liking, but I can't stop putting it on the CD player ... very loud.<br>fifty-something<br>Zoltan Kovacs<br>Ghost Riders in the Sky, various singers (1949). The cowboy classic is one of the earliest songs I remember hearing on the radio. It has a haunting tune that echoes down the years. I used to wonder how you go about riding ghosts.<br>Ave Maria, by church choirs all over the place (1953). Bach's infectious melody had charms to soothe our savage breasts, when as schoolboys we were more typically intent on football and mayhem. It is a song to lift the spirit - and to bounce with tuneless vigour off bathroom walls.<br>Heartbreak Hotel, Elvis Presley (1957). It was not so much the feral beat - or even the swivel hips - that made our generation's parents livid about Elvis; it was the sullen pout conveying the essence of disconsolate youth that did the job. The Presley pout became the standard teenage expression of rejection of adult values. Elvis' early songs - whether you liked them or not - were the fanfares of rebellion.<br>Mack the Knife, Louis Armstrong (1959). For years, we risked sore throats from trying to imitate his unique, rasping singing voice. His soaring trumpet sweeps away the cares of the workaday world.<br>Sentimental Journey, Ray Conniff (1960). For a while, Conniff seemed to be a part of every teenage party. This saccharine little number usually came on late in proceedings and you got to hold a girl in your arms while doing what was then a disreputable dance aptly named the creep.<br>Ol' Man River, Paul Robeson (1960). If I could have the voice of my choice, his is the one I would choose. No matter what he sang, it always had the quality of perfection. This is a song that has spanned the generations.<br>Born to Have the Blues, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee (1963). They were the stars of the first blues concert I attended, and I became an addicted fan. People around me have had their tolerance driven to the limit by the continual playing of this over the years.<br>Lara's theme from Dr Zhivago (1966). Listed for romantic reasons which we won't go into here.<br>Yesterday, The Beatles (1975). Paul McCartney sang this accompanied only by his guitar at a concert in the Entertainment Centre about 20 years ago. I doubt that anyone who was there has forgotten the sweet melancholy of the moment.<br>Words, the Bee Gees (1978). As the song says, ?words are all I have.? My working life has been one long struggle with words - my daily joy and despair. I can't help being drawn to a song that celebrates the wonder and romance of words.<br>sixty-something<br>Cyril Ayris<br>Rose Marie, Nelson Eddie (1943). The first song I remember. It was my introduction to popular musicals.<br>The White Cliff of Dover, Vera Lynn (1944). I found the notion of blue birds over Dover's white cliffs impossible to grasp. That piece of sky was for barrage balloons, fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns.<br>Ave Maria, Bing Crosby (1945). The most melodious voice I had ever heard. It inspired me to join the church choir, a decision that engendered little enthusiasm from the vicar and less from his congregation.<br>Moonlight Serenade, Glenn Miller (1946). I was taught to dance to this big band piece by the school dance instructor, Miss Orange. I was particularly proud of my 360-degree "swizzle', executed at each corner of the gymnasium and capable of causing my partner whiplash.<br>Hello Dolly, Louis Armstrong (1949). At the age of 12, I learned all the words, thus acquiring a reputation for musical sophistication.<br>Danny Boy, Bing Crosby (about 1949). The most beautiful ballad ever written sung by the world's best crooner. It made me want to go to Ireland.<br>Mona Lisa, Nat King Cole (1950). ?The King? brought a new dimension to popular singing. I became a fan for life.<br>My Truly, Truly Fair, Guy Mitchell (1951). I can still hear that song drifting from a fair ground on the outskirts of a small English town into my boarding school dormitory where I had long been abed. It was 10pm, still broad daylight and I wished I could have been at the fair.<br>The Great Pretender, The Platters (1956). ?Oh-O-O yes, I'm the great ...? Maybe it was the Walter Mitty in me, but this number came up well under the shower. My landlady complained that my signing was ?playing havoc? with her budgerigars and issued an ultimatum.<br>Friendly Persuasion, Pat Boon (1957). ?Thee is mine ...? I was about to be married and took to singing this softly in her ear, earning another ultimatum.<br>seventy-something<br>Athol Thomas<br>Alleluia, I'm a Bum, (origin and singer unknown, first heard 1932). This was the first song I can remember hearing on the radio in the early-1930s. Along with ?I'm Nuthin' but a Nuthin',? it reflected the gloom of the Great Depression and my own straitened, bread-and-dripping childhood.<br>Oh, Promise Me, Irwin Thomas (1934). Irwin Thomas was my father and sang this song so often during amateur contests in local town halls that it is etched in my soul. He always ran third but boasted proudly that he had sung before the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York and many other hotels.<br>Moonlight Become You, Bing Crosby (1944). I adopted this song, from one of the Crosby-Hope ?road? films, as the one I sang to the girls I was courting. There was one note that I could not quite get, so results were uneven - though a girl named Amy said I was next best to Bing. She married a sailor.<br>Stouthearted Men, Nelson Eddy (1938). As a teenager I idolised Eddy and, when I was not being Crosby, I was serenading Jeanette MacDonald or singing one of Eddy's rousing ballads. Stouthearted Men made me feel manly.<br>The Lord's Prayer, John Charles Thomas (1950). Though not deeply, or even shallowly religious, I have always felt a mild heart flutter as Thomas (no relation) hits the high notes in his stirring version of The Lord's Prayer. Unhappily the song and praying no longer seem to be quite so popular.<br>Charmaine, Donald Novis (1938). The now-forgotten Novis was a crooning tenor with a clear-bell-like voice who used to bracket this song with another called Diane. For years I looked for Charmaines and Dianes to sing these songs to but kept meeting Dorothys and Beryls.<br>I'm the Man Who Found the Lost Chord, Jimmy ?Schnozzle? Durante (1946). No other popular entertainer could match Durante for singing and playing nonsense songs like this one. While I would not like his nose, I have always admired and tried to copy his zaniness.<br>The Last Time I Saw Paris, various artists (1945). Many of those who fought in World War II regard this as the most nostalgic of war songs. I was one of them, and always sing it when I'm in Paris (well, I've sung it twice).<br>My Way, Frank Sinatra (1986). This song, written specially for the great man, shows off all his talents and demands the best of all bathroom baritones. I'm sure my father and I would have attempted a duet had we had the opportunity. We both went our ways, if in different directions.<br>Nessun Dorma, Luciano Pavarotti (1992). This short aria from Puccini's Turandot has helped me on my irregular but generally enchanting forays into classical music. I constantly look for more musical bridges of this kind.<br></font></p>
