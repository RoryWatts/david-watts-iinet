            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">This was the scene at our house the other day:<br>12-year-old girl watching Four Weddings and a Funeral on one TV;<br>Nine-year-old boy beavering away at Lylat Wars on the Nintendo64 hooked up to another TV;<br>43-year-old bloke browsing the Web while listening to Triple M online and watching the Test on remaining TV.<br>It was a pretty typical day and, based on anecdotal evidence, similar to ones experienced in other homes. The days of the hunter-gatherer are well and truly over. We are clearly experiencing the days of multimedia.<br>Before I go on, let me explain that I normally don't listen to Triple M. When it was 96FM and played lots of Springsteen and I was 10 or so years younger it was never off the dial. The only reason it gets a guernsey now is that I can listen to it with the RealPlayer just by clicking an icon on its Web site.<br>Bandwidth restrictions can make reception a bit iffy, particularly when there is congestion on the network. But, a little bit like a mountain climber, I listen because it is there.<br>Now where was I? Ah yes; what we need in this couch-potato lifestyle is a healthy dose of Luddism; some wild-eyed attacks on technology to awaken us to the fact that TV or radio is not real life, just an idle reflection of it that can be twisted to obscure a proper view.<br>Ironically, a good place to find out about Luddites is the Web, the most intricate extension of technology this century.<br>At Luddites On-Line the motto is ?Life was better before sliced bread?. And the question is posed to the browsing Netizen: ?Do you loathe computers? Does advanced industrial society really annoy you? Looking for a bike lane on the information superhighway??<br>It is when Luddites On-Line starts to explain Luddism that the penny drops. For example: ?Some factories had sprung up in Nottingham that used mechanised looms.<br>The weavers weren't happy about this. The junk they were making with the machines wasn't nearly as good as what they had made at home. Somehow the frames that the loom machines used started getting broken.<br>?Nobody wanted to fess up to this blatant act of vandalism. So they blamed this guy called Ned Ludd and called it Luddism.?<br>It goes on and on, explaining that Ludd was simple and clumsy, then wonders if he existed at all. Actually, it is accurate but told very flippantly.<br>Luddites On-Line has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. That message is reinforced when you follow a link called Who is a Luddite? which claims to uncover the great Luddites of history.<br>It names former US president Ronald Reagan - his economic policies caused industrial decay - OJ Simpson - because his lawyers asserted science and technology were all wrong - and, amazingly, Bill Gates.<br>This is what Luddites has to say about Mr Gates: ?The richest man in the world prefers to spend his late-night off-hours in a loin cloth of hand-woven yarn and bits of fur. The Billion Dollar Man strides proudly into the Redmond evening on his palatial estate, calling each of the birds by name and occasionally braying at the moon.?<br>Bet you didn't know that.<br>The best part is a quiz to determine whether you are a Luddite. Among multiple-choice questions to answer are:<br>Do you find yourself stressed out regularly about cross-platform incompatibility? a) Yes b) No.<br>If you were President, which Bill would you sign first: a) Double the minimum wage b) Free tuition at public universities or c) Proficiency requirements for HTML authoring.<br>Do you ever dream of electric sheep? a) Yes b) No.<br>This is a place to go to when you're sick of Home and Away, can't stand Howard Sattler anymore or when Internet Explorer throws up yet another fault ? a place to get away from it all.<br>I closed the page when Triple M started playing Come On Eileen. Just had to groove along and show my age. There are more things in life than the Net, you know.<br></font></p>
