            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PATRIOTIC or plain one-eyed Australian sports fans could have a heart attack if they look at one of Yahoo's many World Wide Web sites on the Atlanta Olympics.<br>Australian swimming great Dawn Fraser - winner of three gold medals in the 100m freestyle at successive Olympics - has been made an American. The very idea that Fraser, the original Balmain Battler, could be a Yank is preposterous in the extreme.<br>But there it is in black and white at Yahoo's otherwise excellent Olympics Scorecard. The site allows surfers to choose any Olympic event and browse the medallists since the event first started.<br>In the case of the women's 100m freestyle, Fraser won in 1956 at Melbourne, 1960 at Rome and 1964 at Tokyo - a feat never achieved before or since by any swimmer.<br>Yahoo correctly lists her as an Australian in 1956 and 1964, but she mysteriously represents the US in 1960.<br>It is as though the Americans are envious of our swimming prowess - which is the topic of a heated debate in the newsgroup rec.sport.olympics.<br>An Australian correspondent posed the question why was Australia, not the US, one of the few countries to attend every Games since 1896, and why is our swimming record so good per head of population against America's.<br>Angry American e-mails retorted the Americans had ?better things to do than look at the bottom of the pool, then die of skin cancer?.<br>To which Australian voices have hit back, claiming that the ?better things? Americans do is watch Pamela Anderson on Baywatch ?believing she is the world record holder for the 50m freestyle?.<br>Meanwhile, back at the Web, Olympic fever is catching.<br>Of the many sites on offer, Encyclopedia Britannica's Sporting Record - offered through the errant Yahoo - is excellent for history buffs.<br>NBC, the US TV giant, has a big presence because it has won the rights to telecast the Games. But its Web site looks messy compared with the Atlanta Constitution-Journal's site, which appears to reflect the city's pride in hosting the event.<br>Olympics On NBC - www.olympic.nbc.com<br>1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games - www.paralympic.org<br>Yahoo!
