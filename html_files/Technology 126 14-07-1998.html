            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MAJOR search engine Lycos is trying to cut the chances of children stumbling across the World Wide Web's sewers of porn.<br>It has set up a site called SafetyNet which allows parents or guardians to register and apply a background program to the popular search engine that aims to filter out adults-only content.<br>Tests of SafetyNet's effectiveness by The West Australian last week yielded good results.<br>We entered the words ?hardcore pornography? in the normal Lycos engine and were presented with hundreds of X-rated sites as well as a lurid advertising banner on the Lycos page that could be followed to a big porn site.<br>But when SafetyNet (which stands for Search And Filter Enhanced Technology for Your Net) was applied, the same search came back with a ?sorry, no matches found?.<br>The advertising banner changed to one for the New York Times newspaper.<br>Lycos says that SafetyNet blocks many pornographic and/or offensive words from being entered in a search query.<br>Inquiring young minds are apt to do this, and in the past have not needed the Internet to help them. For example, children have looked up supposedly dirty words in dictionaries for years.<br>What the Net has given the same inquiring minds, unfortunately, is the ability to stumble on graphic porn sites that leave little to the imagination.<br>Most appear to require registration and credit card details before allowing surfers to view their full wares, but opening pages typically display examples of what can be found.<br>Lycos has tried to cut the chances of getting even this much of a look by using SafetyNet to push sites that contain pornographic material to the bottom of search results.<br>This, it is hoped, will lessen the chance of accidental exposure in cases where links to those sites are produced in response to non-pornographic search terms (this is a common method for so-called ?adult? sites to increase their exposure).<br>Chat, e-mail and message board (so-called BBS) features can be disabled when SafetyNet protection is turned on.<br>Lycos says that there is no way to guarantee total safety. ?(But) SafetyNet will dramatically reduce the possibility of exposure to adult content, and will eliminate the risks inherent to children and teens participating in unsupervised chat and e-mail exchanges.?<br>IT LOOKS like Yahoo - the Web's most popular search index - but NewHoo has one vital difference. It is set up to be maintained by people of the Internet community themselves as voluntary editors.<br>Yahoo is so big and omnipresent that it is a star on the stockmarket and brings in millions of dollars in revenue a year.<br>It also needs to keep growing just to keep in touch with the rapid expansion of Web pages that it seeks to index for easy searching.<br>This means more staff and more expense; a never-ending rat-race cycle that would not have been envisaged by the pioneers of the Web who surfed it for fun and not profit.<br>The NewHoo project relies on the communalism of the Web to produce its listings.<br>Last week, NewHoo had links to 41,507 sites in 8633 categories which were maintained by 1384 editors.<br>NewHoo says members of the Net community need to organise the Web themselves rather than trying to fight, or cope with, its growth.<br>Help Desk<br>SafetyNet:<br>personal.lycos.com/safetynet/<br>safetynet.asp<br>NewHoo:<br>www.newhoo.com<br></font></p>
