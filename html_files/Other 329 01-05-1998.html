            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE hardest thing about growing older is constantly being reminded how things have changed. Last Tuesday night, for example, I saw a bloke called Zane beat another called Trent in the Commonwealth Games swimming selection trials. In AFL matches at the weekend there was a Beau, a Jaxon, a Big Sav, a Winston and a Fabian.<br>Only yesterday the world was full of Matts and Jasons and Liams and Crystals and Skyes. The world, I guess, I was more comfortable with Davids, Peters, Sues and Christines.<br>But it's not just names that are widening the generation gap. The present taste in movies thrives on nostalgia for a past that seems to have barely passed.<br>Thus we have Lost in Space and Leave it to Beaver on the big screen. Not long ago it was The Addams Family and The Flintstones. What next? Will we see Neighbours, Seinfeld, Friends or Melrose Place in some frantic rush to preserve the 90s before the millennium strikes?<br>The present No. 1 rating movie in Perth appears to be the loathsome and spotty The Wedding Singer, in which former wild girl Drew Barrymore is revealed as a homely type rather than a sizzling sexpot.<br>What is worse, however, is that the film is set way, way back in 1985; a time that is made fun of because of its music and fashion. And what's more, young kiddies - well teens anyway - are coming away laughing at how preposterous everybody looked in Miami Vice pastel colours, thin ties, or festooned in Madonna bracelets and scarves.<br>One of the things you used to be sure of in life was that Australia and New Zealand were two quite separate countries. The only real similarity was an abundance of sheep.<br>Even then, theirs were fluffy, fat, white things gambolling on bright green hillsides; whereas ours were stringy, thirsty, brown things spread sparsely among the spinifex.<br>We have different cultures . . . we're good at cricket and swimming; they're not. They're good at rugby union; we're good at rugby league. They're not even on the same planet when it comes to real footy.<br>We have different languages. For example, the following are given first in English, then Australian, then New Zealandic.<br>Bondi; Bondi; home.<br>Sir Richard Hadlee; (unprintable); Sir Wretched Hidlee.<br>You get the idea - separate countries, separate identities. Not any more.<br>On Tuesday the Australian High Court removed a crucial barrier to the import of cheap NZ television programs.<br>The judgment was greeted with dismay by Australian actors, directors, producers and writers. This is not surprising because the court found that NZ productions should be treated equally with local shows under Australian television content regulations.<br>Groups such as the Australian Film Commission, the Children's Television Foundation, the Screen Producers Association and the Australian Writers Guild said it would kill local - under the old definition that means Australian - programs by allowing a flood of cheap imported shows.<br>But the Kiwis won because our content standards - which require 55 per cent of commercial programming between 6am and midnight to be Australian - contravened open-trade provisions of the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement between the countries.<br>The way now appears to be open for our already stupid idiot boxes to become somewhat sillier with an infusion of programs that might include (from NZ's TVOne program schedule):<br>McCormick, described as a chat show on wheels; or that country's longest-running and highest-rating show, Fair Go, ?a unique weekly mixture of hard-nosed investigative reporting with light-hearted stories related to consumer affairs?.<br>Or will they just make cheap copies of our own favourites and regale us with Blue Hillers and the Fitty Shew?<br>It's enough to make you want to cash in your chups.<br></font></p>
