            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT SHOULD come as no surprise that politicians are no better than the bulk of the population at using the Internet.<br>After all, despite the constant bagging they receive, they are only human.<br>Their Net expertise appears to range from the extremely competent, complete with Web page skills, to those who think a computer will not work unless it has a secretary in front of it. Either that, or they still think of computers as those warehouse-sized dinosaurs from old James Bond films.<br>You remember that sort of computer? If you typed on its rickety keyboard fast enough - without using the space-bar - a message (always in capital letters) would pop up saying: Secret Password OK. Do you want to destroy the Earth a) Now or b) Just as soon as Commander Bond joins us to heighten the drama?<br>US politicians probably have the edge on their Australian counterparts, although not as much as Vice-President Al Gore would have us believe by his recent claim that he invented the Internet.<br>One who used his Net know-how last week was Steve Forbes, whose day job is multi-millionaire publishing tycoon.<br>Mr Forbes became the first person to announce his candidacy for president at his own Web site. Not surprisingly he pledged a campaign for a new age of information.<br>The race for the US presidency in 2000 is a long way from what Australian politicians put on their Web pages, though.<br>Recently I felt like testing the Net as a democratic vehicle. The day the Federal Government announced it was putting the republic referendum draft up for public scrutiny, I e-mailed Curtin Liberal MHR Julie Bishop and Dr Lawrence.<br>The message was brief and perhaps brusque: Do you know if this draft is on the Web? If so, where; if not, why not?<br>Within hours, Ms Bishop had replied with a friendly e-mail pointing out the URL. Dr Lawrence's office got back to me shortly after with the same information.<br>They certainly appear to be two politicians who are getting to know the Net as an important feedback tool.<br>Premier Richard Court has had his own Web page for three years and allows people to subscribe to an e-mail information service, so he also looks Net-savvy.<br>But the only e-mail I have received in six months from this service - a time of belltowers, Elle, forest debates etc - came last week.<br>It said Mr Court's 500 Club luncheon speech of February 19 was now available for viewing on the Web.<br>I replied tartly that this had to win the cryptic e-mail of the week award and next day I was advised of the URL where I could read the month-old speech.<br>We are all learning.<br>HELP DESK<br>Australian Politicians on the Web:<br>plato.itsc.adfa.edu.au/apr/pollies.html<br>Forbes2000: www.forbes2000.com<br>Republic referendum draft:<br>www.dpmc.gov.au/referendum/<br>Richard Court's site: www.premier.wa.gov.au<br>Rob Johnson:<br>frontpage.highway1.com.au/johnson/index.htm<br>Carmen Lawrence:<br>www.ctl.com.au/mpfreo/index.htm<br></font></p>
