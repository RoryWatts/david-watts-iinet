            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE lurgi has come to my neighbourhood, flattening with a sickly sledgehammer my wife, my neighbour, several friends and possibly their dogs and cats. Oh, and me too.<br>This year's amusing flu virus has struck just when many thought it was safe to go outdoors. The wind and rain of a cold, miserable winter has abated; the sun is warm and the sea breeze is a balm not a bomb.<br>But it is here and the stricken population must deal with it. One of life's little peculiarities is medicine ... potions and pills. The trouble is the flu causes major muscle weakness and joint pain.<br>So what do medicines - designed to help alleviate these nasties - come in? Blister packs and child-proof screw caps, of course.<br>This means when you go to take a dose of medicine, it is impossible to pop a pill out of its packaging or screw off the lid to get at others without risking major muscle weakness or joint soreness.<br>The other big worry about medicine is that nearly every brand causes constipation. Take an antibiotic (?this medication may cause constipation?); or a pain-stopper (?regular use may cause constipation?).<br>I would not be surprised to see a laxative with the warning ?will cause constipation?.<br>After you've ruined your muscles and joints taking the medicine and have sat on the loo, unhappily, for an hour, there is a lot of activity for the flu-ridden to choose from - you can lie down in bed, sit up in bed or sleep.<br>The more adventurous who are into their fifth day of constipation may even like to read.<br>Stories about hospitals, terminal illness and lack of libido are not recommended. I managed to read an article from the worthy British current affairs magazine The Economist the other night after a two-hour battle with pills to disinfect, capsules to stop pain, laxatives to ease constipation and Deep Heat to soothe muscle soreness (I trust it does not cause constipation).<br>The Economist article cast doubt on the computer revolution, saying the billions invested in new technology had not been reaped in productivity gains.<br>One of the bogies, it said, was Solitaire. The proliferation of PCs in workplaces meant that the outbreak of Solitaire playing had reached epidemic proportions. The Economist lectured that this was a Bad Thing.<br>I disagree heartily. Seriously, a person scared of computers will learn quickly how to operate a mouse and cursor - clicking, double clicking etc - with a few good hands.<br>People also discover that computers are nothing more than lightning fast idiots. If they weren't you could win Solitaire every time and cheat and cheat ... just like most Patience players do with real decks of cards.<br>BUT computer programs abide by strict sets of rules that mean if you try to perform a usual Patience cheat - like going back through the deck of upturned cards for the crucial four of diamonds - it won't let you.<br>Thus you can swear and become frustrated just as you would in a normal, fair game.<br>Computers sometimes come with more than your common, garden-variety brand of Patience. Mine has some delightful twists called Cruel Solitaire, Golf Solitaire, Klondike and Free Cell.<br>Cruel Solitaire looks easy but in all but two of 100 instances in the past 12 months, it has flashed the message ?Game over, sorry you lose? just as the coup de grace was about to be applied.<br>You can play all these when you have the flu, too. The frustrating thing is that you cannot end it all with a rollicking game of 52 pick-up.<br>And of course it costs about $3000 to buy a computer with Solitaire, compared with a couple of dollars for a cheap deck at Coles or Woolies.<br>It is enough to make you sick.<br></font></p>
