            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Paint Shop Pro 5<br>Graphics editor for Windows95/98<br>Download from: www.jasc.com<br>Size: 6.85MB<br>Shareware (30-day free trial).<br>Cost: about $150<br>An essential program in any Web author's toolbox is a graphics editor which can crop, resize, adjust and even distort images for use on HTML pages. One of the most popular for Windows users for more than two years has been Paint Shop Pro.<br>The easy-to-use piece of shareware is now up to version 5 - released last month - and it looks and feels better than ever. Sometimes new versions of software can be disappointing because they offer little new other than a redesigned interface.<br>This is not the case with Paint Shop Pro. Reviewers at cnet and the Consumate Winsock site have been moved to compare PSP with the Rolls-Royce of graphics editors, Adobe Photoshop.<br>PSP is said to have 90 per cent of Photoshop's features for 20 per cent of the price - a telling statement.<br>Standard image tools are built into PSP as well as features that won't be found in Photoshop and similar competitors, including quick batch conversion capabilities for converting graphic files from one image type to another (JPEGs to Bitmaps or BMPs for instance), advanced screen capturing with automatic drag and drop, a built-in browser for quickly viewing an entire directory, colour replacer and masking tools, interlaced graphics support (for GIF 87a and 89a images) and vector-based image capabilities.<br>PSP even provides built-in browsers that allow users to preview the results different filters or manipulators will have on an image.<br>As in earlier versions, PSP offers support for more than 40 file formats, provides comprehensive tools that make it simple to perform image adjustments (like cropping and retouching photos) and includes a wide variety of painting and drawing tools.<br>Reviewers at cnet claim that the biggest highlight of the new version is support for maskable layers. The Layers tool simplifies image composition and manipulation by allowing the user to adjust each part of an image separately, without affecting any of the others. The Masks feature determines which colours are transparent, allowing underlying layers to show through.<br>The unique Custom Brushes and Picture Tubes features help users to create complicated images ideal for backgrounds.<br>Other Web creation features are the new Palette tool which includes improved GIF transparency and a prebuilt, ?browser-safe? 216-colour palette; and Animation Shop, which lets you easily manufacture GIF animations.<br>PSP is a medium-sized download in these days of bloatware like Netscape Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. On installation it seems a bit slow to start, but once open it operates much quicker than previous versions.<br>Toolbars are easily manipulated and well signposted so that you can find out about the many functions by hovering over the icons. The help facilities have improved enormously with particular attention paid to online support on the Web.<br>Speed is not impaired when performing what might seem a heavyweight job like browsing through all images in a directory. Unlike earlier versions, PSP now lets the directory of images stay on screen while individual files are called.<br>Cropping, adjustment (of brightness for example), distortion, colour changes and manipulation all seem easy tasks because of PSP's boost in speed.<br>All that is really needed is a steady hand and a creative mind.<br></font></p>
