            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE good news about Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer is that both Web browsers expand computer users' horizons on the Internet.<br>The bad news is that they both suffer an array of bugs.<br>Both programs in their latest version 3.0 release are available in different packages ranging from 5MB to 9MB in zipped size, depending on plug-ins and add-ons.<br>That amount of code so quickly developed to gain an edge in Net domination is bound to have glitches, even if only in obscure facets.<br>The browser bugs range from general instability to security risks. Some go unnoticed and some - which cause general protection faults or fatal exception errors - are very annoying.<br>Some may not have a solution, dumbfounding their developers at Microsoft and Netscape, according to the latest news from US Net company cnet. Reports from users and cnet software reviewers have revealed the following bugs for Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>?Several Web sites have required users to repeatedly confirm their username and password to visit different areas of the site.<br>Fix: Microsoft says none of the sites currently exhibits the behaviour. An MSIE 3.0 patch is available to update the affected components and ensure all sites continue to work as expected. MS said this bug did not pose a security risk, but made using some sites inconvenient.<br>?When downloading from the Net IE 3.0 warns users that viruses may be present in documents and gives the option of cancelling. In some cases, researchers at Princeton University were able to disable this option and download documents without a warning.<br>Fix: The technique for disabling the warning is complex and difficult to implement, and Microsoft says it has not received any reports of sites that exploit the behaviour.<br>However, MS created a fix and included it in the IE 3.0 patch.<br>?Upgrading to IE 3.0 from a previous version removes customised Web pages (like the Microsoft Network Web page) and files stored in your old browser's cache.<br>Fix: No fix available.<br>?You may not be able to use Trumpet Winsock or the Tribal Voice PowWow Internet program.<br>Fix: Microsoft says it is working on a solution.<br>?When a URL is selected from the IE 3.0 address field, the Copy option in the Edit menu is greyed out and Paste does nothing.<br>Fix: To work around this problem, use the right mouse button and select the option there.<br>And for Netscape Navigator the following bugs have been uncovered.<br>?When the right mouse button is used to view a single GIF image in 256-colour mode, there may be a flash as the custom colour map is installed.<br>Fix: Netscape is investigating but there is no fix yet.<br>?Conflicts between Navigator and your system's video driver may cause browser crashes.<br>Fix: Make sure that you are using the latest drivers for your video card. Contact the video card's manufacturer.<br>?Open the Find dialogue box in either Netscape Mail or Netscape News. The Up/Down radio buttons on the right do not work.<br>Fix: As in Navigator 2.0, the Find command in Navigator 3.0 Mail can search in only one direction: down. When Find reaches the bottom of the Inbox message list, however, it returns to the top and continues searching from there.<br>?In Windows 95, if you install Navigator 3.0 over Navigator 2.02 without first removing the older version, you may get an error message stating that url.dll will be repaired when you restart Windows.<br>Fix: Don't worry about it. The installation will be okay.<br>?Per cent signs (%) do not work in URLs.<br>Fix: If you want to put a per cent sign into a URL, you must represent it as its hex code (%25). Netscape says this is actually correct; it was Navigator 2.0 that didn't treat per cent signs correctly.<br>URL for full bug list: www.cnet.com/Content/Features/Howto/Bugs/<br></font></p>
