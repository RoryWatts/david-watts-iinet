            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">STAR WARS<br>ZDNNews Special report<br>www.zdnet.com/zdnn/special/theforce.html<br>A NEW word will have to be invented. The hype that has surrounded the release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace has out-hyped anything seen in entertainment circles since the invention of the big screen.<br>The movie will be in Perth next month, but has opened to massive audiences in the US with mixed reviews from mainstream critics.<br>This Ziff Davis Publishing site is an attempt to cool down the hype for a more objective look at the film and its adherents.<br>But as Star Wars is a much loved phenomenon among Net users, this special may not be all that objective.<br>It does offer some interesting articles, including a review from a ZDNet staff member who says The Phantom Menace has the power to awe; and the diary of a Star Wars fanatic who queued for 25 hours for tickets.<br>Search for reviews<br>www.mrqe.com/lookup?<br>SIMPLY plug the words ?phantom menace? into the window of the Movie Review Query Engine, and it will pop up 37 reviews of the new Star Wars film.<br>The very briefest of glances reveals a wide range of critical opinion.<br>Independent Net-based critics such as James Berardinelli at Reel Films, Michael Dequina and Christopher Null have rated it highly with scores of 3.5 out of 4 and 4 out of 5.<br>But critics from the mainstream press have been less kind. The New York Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette rate it 2.5 out of 4.<br>NEWSPAPERS<br>Sinbad (Iraqi online news)<br>www.index.com.jo/iraqtoday/index.html<br>THE most striking feature of this site, which puts online an edition of the weekly Al-Zawra newspaper, is the big portrait of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with birthday greetings.<br>The penny drops when you realise the paper is owned by Mr Hussein's oldest son, who has moved his operation on to the Web to try to break down what he sees as a media embargo against his country.<br>The site is published in Arabic and English on the Iraq Today site based in Jordan.<br></font></p>
