            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>Encylopedia.com<br>One of the real frustrations on the Web is trying to verify information while doing research. There is a mountain of stuff, of course - but can it be trusted? One answer has been to insert a costly CD-ROM encyclopedia such as Microsoft Encarta or Britannica. Neither gives much away on the Web.<br>Encyclopedia.com overcomes this frustration to a degree. It is billed as the Internet's premiere free encyclopaedia. And well it may be. There doesn't appear to be any real competition. More than 17,000 articles from the Concise Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Third Edition, have been assembled.<br>Entries are short, so fact-checking - either by search or alphabetical browsing - is quick. Encyclopedia.com is the work of the Electric Library, which claims to be a leading research service on the Net. Plenty of links are provided to check out this claim. (DW)<br>Rockingham Guide<br>Planning a day trip to Rockingham and don't know what activities are on offer? Then a bit of homework at local resident Annabella's site will leave you with plenty of options. Annabella, who has lived in the Rockingham area for 21 years, has compiled a great deal of information, ranging from water activities (diving, surfcats, swimming with dolphins) to parks and wildlife (Cape Peron, Marapana Wildlife World).She also has an introduction to the Rockingham area, accommodation details, a handy community message board and an address directory open to anyone in the Rockingham Shire who is on the Net.On the downside, some of the pages are rather long, so be prepared to use those scroll bars. And as you browse, be prepared to get your ears blasted when your browser starts playing tinny MIDI versions of Under The Boardwalk, Land Down Under and other muzak. Annabella must spend half her life at the keyboard because this is just one section of a massive site including a comprehensive set of HTML tutorials. (SY)<br>Weekly World News Online<br>If papers that scream headlines such as ?four-legged woman?, ?half-man half-fish?, ?photos prove Elvis faked his death?, ?shuttle brings back space alien corpse? and ?Hillary gives Bill a black eye? (complete with screaming kapow sound effects) are your idea of news, then keep reading.A printed copy of Weekly World News, which made its way from Canada to this office, has proved the source of much amusement - hence the hunt for the online version. The content is totally crass, totally unbelievable and most likely totally fabricated - especially since many of the astounding stories invariably originate in Australia.Much of this site is politically incorrect and if you don't have a sense of humour you may be a trifle offended. The ?bizarre images? of Batboy (our favourite - especially the animation of him eating a bug which allegedly made 42,000 people sick enough to be hospitalised!) and friends are probably the result of a few hours in Photoshop. We think. Because if they're not, Elvis is probably down at Macca's right now and we'll be invaded by aliens tomorrow. (SY)<br>Mark Boyle Photography<br>If Australian landscape photography gets you going, then head along to the Web site of part-time photographer and interactive multimedia student Mark Boyle. From central Australia to the Stirling Ranges, Cape Leveque to Tasmania, Mr Boyle has captured the mood and startling colours of some of the most beautiful places in our great nation.<br>Good quality photographs often take a while to download but these neatly framed images don't seem to suffer from that problem. Part of this stems from the orderly manner in which Mr Boyle has organised his site. It is cleverly designed and neatly structured with thumbnails representing each region, then thumbnails of individual photos, so there's no endless scrolling.Good use of colour and white space and nifty devices such as mouse-overs that pop up text and other information about Mr Boyle help make for an easy to navigate site. Mr Boyle also has a lengthy page of links to everything from Macintosh resources to other photography sites. (SY)<br>Vincent Community Web<br>If you live in the Town of Vincent and want to know more about what is going on up the road, down the street or around the corner, this site may enlighten you.<br>Maintained by the Hyde Park Precinct Group, this Web site was set up to ?encourage community participation in the debate and decision making process on issues affecting Town of Vincent residents and ratepayers?.<br>Local issues such as the proposed sale of the ?old bottleyard? site adjoining Robertson Park and the planned Vincent Greenway (the joining of seven local parks to create a more accessible linear park) are explained in some detail.<br>There is also a list of all councillors complete with photos, contact details and brief information about what they stand for. But if you're just looking for your local community hall, daycare centre or nearby arts and cultural organisations , you'll also find them listed here.<br>The site seems to be to be fairly new, which may explain the lack of anything in the news section, and other than a few maps there are no graphics to speak of. (SY)<br>Drew'sScript-O-Rama<br>This site will sort the real film buffs from the mere enthusiasts. It is a labour of love by its anonymous creator who says he has scoured the Web for scripts of films and TV shows and built links to more than 600 of them. He has built the links to escape breach of copyright laws which would come into force if he hosted the scripts at his own site. So, it is a bit legally dicey, but it is well worth a look if you are keen to find exact scenarios and dialogues from a wide variety of entertainment.Latest scripts linked to include those for Terminator and Terminator 2, Aliens, True Lies and Titanic. There are many scripts of top TV shows as well, including episodes of Fawlty Towers, Dr Who, The Simpsons and the latest cult, South Park. Script-O-Rama has won dozens of awards on the Web - for what they are worth - including bouquets from Lycos, Point.com and Magellan. (DW)<br>Britannica Guide to Winter Games<br>Pardon the pun but if the Winter Olympics leave you cold, then you may warm to them a little if you know what they are all about. In a surf and sun country such as Australia, it seems odd for people to enjoy slithering and schussing about on wet, freezing snow and ice. But it's a big world and millions are as entranced by the lunatics on the luge as we are by shaven-headed butterfliers.<br>Encyclopaedia Britannica continues its excellent online tradition of providing comprehensive guides to major events. It won many kudos for its Atlanta 96 site and US Presidential election special. This guide to the Nagano games is no different. It has good descriptions of the events - so you know what they have to do in curling, for instance - plus biographies of great winter athletes, and details of all medals won, including Australia's speed skating relay bronze at Lillehammer in 1994.
