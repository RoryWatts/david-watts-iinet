            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WARNINGS flew last week, but they did nothing to slow the booming trade in Internet-related stocks.<br>On the one hand:<br>?The world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, warned the lure of Net stocks was creating a lottery mentality among investors who were piling their money into companies destined to go bust.<br>?Wall Street's top regulator, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, urged investors to take a breath and remember traditional rules.<br>?Charles Schwab, chief executive of the popular online traders, told clients his company would be limiting access ?at times? to Web trading in certain stocks because the Net-related market was so hot that demand for trading was exceeding the number of shares available.<br>But on the other hand:<br>?News Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch shrugged off earlier, much-quoted reticence about the Net to put his company into a partnership with the Web's main search engine site, Yahoo. The promotional deal between the two companies was launched during the Superbowl - shown by Murdoch's Fox television.<br>Yahoo will be advertised during Fox's televised sporting events, while Yahoo will promote a variety of Fox properties, including Fox's cable stations and Internet sites such as Sports Net and FX, Fox TV and news, Fox Music and the Twentieth Century Fox film studio.<br>?Yahoo announced it was buying GeoCities Inc for $US7.32 billion ($11.63 billion). The deal creates the biggest Web gateway. GeoCities, with a history of losses, reportedly has 53 million visits to its site each day, and hosts millions of free Web pages created by average users.<br>?Compaq Computer triggered another round of alliances in Net business by hiving off its AltaVista search site as a separate company, leading to a public offering that could be worth $US2 billion.<br>Microsoft, a long-standing Compaq ally, endorsed the deal and said it would adopt AltaVista as the primary search engine of the Microsoft Network.<br>The Guardian in London reported that the DOT index of leading companies involved in Net commerce has risen 34 per cent so far this year. By comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average is unchanged and the Nasdaq composite index is up 11 per cent.<br>In Australia, Net-related prospects also kept the market buoyant.<br>This level of activity, described by Mr Schwab as a hot market, is reflected in visits to financial Web sites.<br>The Where Did We Go list of 100 most-visited Australian sites had 17 finance URLs in its rankings for January. Commonwealth Securities Share Direct, an offshoot from the Commonwealth Bank site and which allows online trading, was ranked fourth in a list topped by the Australian Open site.<br>One of the stronger finance performers was Perth online broking firm Sanford Securities, which was the 38th most visited site.<br>Sanford deputy managing director Steven Goh said the firm was the country's second biggest Net broker.<br>It rated well ahead of both Macquarie and E*Trade in the January list.<br>?Unlike any other stockbroking firm in Australia, we've developed all the code ourselves,? Mr Goh said.<br>?In this regard, we're unique and for this, we were a finalist in the E-commerce category of the AFR awards, and a finalist in the 1997 AIIA awards for technical excellence.?<br>Help Desk<br>Yahoo!: www.yahoo.com<br>GeoCities: www.geocities.com<br>Where Did We Go:<br>usrwww.mpx.com.au/~ianw/<br>Sanford Securities: www.sanford.com.au<br>Last week's share sites:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/access/shares.html<br></font></p>
