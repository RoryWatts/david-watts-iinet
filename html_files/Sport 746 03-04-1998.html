            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HOW has the weather been? I heard a rumour that it has been boring; endless sunny days, glassy river and ocean, balmy evenings with soft sea breezes and beautifully cool sleepy nights.<br>I wouldn't have a clue, you see. For the past week I've been locked in, a virtual prisoner unable to tell night from day.<br>It all began last Friday morning when Channel 9 transported me to Bangalore in India. We saw the Bradman of the 90s, Sachin Tendulkar, rip the heart out of the Australian bowlers. Even though our golden-haired boy Shane Warne was among the suffering, it was awe-inspiring stuff.<br>But if you don't like cricket, this might be boring. Luckily by late Friday evening there was not a cricket ball to be seen. It was footy on centre stage; this time on Channel 7.<br>Everyone I've spoken to knew the result before the TV coverage of the Eagles v North Melbourne began. And despite the continuing verbal love affair between Bruce McAvaney and Wayne Carey of the Roos, the match just had to be seen.<br>Family bonding, serious discussions, even light ones . . . ah, forget it. Not when Jakovich is keeping Carey quiet or Gardiner is thumping the ball out of the centre square.<br>Pity about the result.<br>Then it was rugby league on Nine. Luckily the kiddies, the wife and even the dog were fast asleep. Rugby league on TV in Perth in the 90s is not for the faint-hearted. It is full of ads featuring lewd young women in very small knickers. Some of them have no knickers at all.<br>Can't remember the result.<br>Saturday was heavenly. And the weather was pretty good too.<br>It was wall-to-wall footy. Not only did I watch Carlton surprise Adelaide, I was able to keep an eye on Collingwood-Hawthorn and St Kilda-Geelong on the Internet.<br>THE AFL, bless "em, has a Web site that updates scores from all games every 30 seconds. And it has the stats; all the stats - handballs, kicks, tackles, seagulls on the pitch (sorry, wrong game) etc - and you can even check out how many blues each player made.<br>Right there, while you're sitting down in comfort, totally ostracised by the children who wanted to go to Hungry Jack's, the wife who needed a fence picket or two painted, and even the dog who probably still has the lead in his mouth and that pleading look in his eyes.<br>But I know how many times Shane Wakelin took the ball out of the 50-metre arc. And that sort of information will come in handy one day.<br>On Saturday night - knowing I was in trouble with the family - I swore off the footy. Who wants to see Tony Liberatore tag the best of them out of the contest anyway?<br>I watched Australia play Brazil at under-23 soccer instead. We won. I went to bed alone.<br>Sunday dawned . . . so I believe. But I was listening to that hairy idiot Rex Hunt and his mates on Seven's Footy Panel before limbering up for the Dockers-Melbourne clash by sitting through a couple of hours of Port Adelaide nearly beating Sydney.<br>It was very relieving to know that Tony Lockett's groin stood the strain. I tried to relay this information to the family, but they'd left, with the car, and a note saying: ?Your dinner is in the dog.?<br>The computer - which as fate would have it is next to the TV in my office - was relaying the information of Richmond's shock win while I was glued to images of Mike Kasprowicz and Mark Taylor piloting Australia to a famous victory in Bangalore.<br>Then it was the hot Dockers, interrupted by the trivia of whatever else was happening in the world. Then it was all over. But just for that weekend.<br>Monday night brought English soccer and Talking Footy.<br>Tuesday night brought the dog house . . . and no TV or dinner.<br>But the weather's nice.<br></font></p>
