            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MARRIAGE breakdown can be a messy business. Those suffering them would rather not have their private lives exposed to public glare. But that happened to Sydney's Lord Mayor Frank Sartor early this month when pictures of him and former wife Judith Fleming were splashed over page one of the Sydney Daily Telegraph.<br>When Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and his wife Felicity announced their separation in January, the Telegraph trumpeted on page one, End Of a Premier Marriage.<br>Others in the public spotlight also suffer badly when they drop stitches while trying to make life's rich tapestry.<br>Singer George Michael, arrested for a tawdry misdemeanour in Los Angeles, was treated to the following headline in the London Sun, Zip Me Up Before You Go Go. There followed pages of editorial speculation about his shame.<br>The common thread in these exposes is that they were all performed by publications owned by Rupert Murdoch, the man who thought so much of his native Australia that he renounced it in 1985 to become an American citizen so he could gobble up more media outlets there.<br>He has about 70 per cent of Australia's metropolitan newspaper market. One he does not own is this one.<br>So, was it any surprise that when Mr Murdoch's marriage of 31 years to novelist and co-director wife, Anna, ended earlier this week the news was greeted with polite restraint by his own publications?<br>The man, who built an empire on prying into what his papers considered either the unsavoury or at least juicy lifestyles of others, was treated with enormous respect in his own moment of private grief.<br>The Daily Telegraph - so blaring with the misfortunes of Cr Sartor and Mr Kennett - devoted seven discreet paragraphs to the story at the bottom of page three. It was based almost entirely on a tiny item by Liz Smith in the Murdoch-owned New York Post gossip column which broke the news (and which inaccurately reported the Murdochs had been married for 32 years). The Australian had a bigger coverage but at the bottom of page three. In London, the Sun played down the news, though The Times treated the story with some importance.<br>The bottom line is one of the world's leading media tycoons, owner of papers and television channels which regularly intrude into people's private lives for no other reason than they happen to be famous, and glory in their misfortunes at times when they are at their most vulnerable, has suffered a marriage breakdown.And the Murdoch message obviously is: Leave me out of it; it's my party and I'll cry in private.<br>But, as the Guardian (non-Murdoch) commented: ?. . . anyone would conclude that the man who has made a fortune from tormenting presidents, senior politicians and celebrities across the world has placed himself squarely in the eyes of the media?.<br>The rules do not apply to Mr Murdoch, of course. His ambition to own rugby league so that it could form the mainstay of his Foxtel pay-TV sports menu, nearly killed the game and cost his company roughly the equivalent of a developing country's annual budget.<br>Undaunted, he caused much grief in LA by buying the LA Dodgers, one of the most beloved US Major League baseball teams.<br>He is deeply involved in wiring China to the world through Star TV; and even stated that such technology would ensure the end of totalitarian regimes. Of course, when the totalitarian regime objected to the BBC spreading non-party views of the world on Star TV, Mr Murdoch kicked them off the team. When former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten decided to write a book critical of the Chinese Government, Mr Murdoch's HarperCollins refused to publish it.<br>Given a dose of private grief, and the gentle treatment he has received, he may now start to question whether it is really worth owning and running the world.<br>But don't bet on it.<br></font></p>
