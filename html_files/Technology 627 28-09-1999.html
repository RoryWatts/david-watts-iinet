            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE is no escaping one simple fact about the Internet - it has an abundance of pornography.<br>Fear that children will stumble on what is genteelly known as inappropriate content is often cited as why more people do not go online.<br>The onus for choosing what children access is with parents and guardians such as teachers, not the Government or software companies pushing flawed filtering technology.<br>That leaves a possibly frightening question for adults - how do I regulate the Net for my children when they understand it better than I do?<br>There is no easy answer.<br>Avoidance of porn requires a degree of application and knowledge that can be gained only by learning about the medium.<br>One reason why there is a sewer of porn is that sex sites make money. They account for 10 per cent of all e-commerce, generating about $1.5 billion in revenue last year, according to the Forrester Research group in the US.<br>Most Web surfers who have seen a sex site will know one reason why they make money - apart from the fact that sex sells - is that they demand upfront credit card payment.<br>Sex sites use dozens of misleading words in the HTML of their pages so that search engines will return to them for requests that have little to do with the subject.<br>It is not possible to ban the use of search engines because they can be as useful as they are inconsistent, misleading and frustrating.<br>However, sites such as the Australian Broadcasting Authority's Family Guide to the Internet provide links and advice that might help find better ways to search.<br>I have also produced a Homework Help Web page that aims to provide links to less generalised and hopefully safer search engines (see Help Desk).<br>A click on a sex site URL will give a surfer some previews of what is on offer, often fairly explicit.<br>But full admission to a site is nearly always impossible until the user enters their credit card details in a special form, and fills in a declaration that they are of legal age.<br>Children can no doubt pretend they are of legal age, but ensuring they cannot access your credit cards would stop them getting in too far.<br>Adults who do not want children to access such sites can tell if attempts have been made to do so.<br>One area of evidence will be in the browser cache where copies of pages accessed while online are available for offline viewing.<br>The browser history list will also show the day's URLs visited, and often goes back at least five days.<br>Also, adults should be in charge of family e-mail.<br>A giveaway that someone has been checking out the dark side of life is that sex sites send junk e-mail to people who have visited to try to interest them in subscribing or looking at other sites.<br>Concerned adults would be well advised to read Time Magazine's online essay, What Can Parents Do?<br>Its theme is: ?We want our kids to use the Net but worry about what they'll find.?<br>Here are some ways to steer them straight.<br>Help Desk<br>ABA Family Guide:<br>www.aba.gov.au/family/index.html<br>Homework Help:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/access/<br>homehelp.html<br>Time magazine article:<br>www.pathfinder.com/time/<br>cyberguide/index.html<br></font></p>
