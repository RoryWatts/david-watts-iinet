            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALL the players in the John Laws controversy use the Web to put their opinions.<br>But neither Laws nor the Australian Bankers Association has a word to say about the issue in their slices of cyberspace.<br>Laws might be facing several inquiries about taking money to stop criticising banks, but appears to have chosen not to defend himself at his Web site called John Laws' Fortress.<br>A page devoted to weekly highlights of his 2UE radio program was last updated on April 16. A spokesman for Toyota, which is responsible for maintenance of the site, told the Australian PC magazine last week the site was updated only when a new story from Laws came through.<br>The site is open to feedback and e-mails from Laws' listeners are posted on a page called Have Your Say.<br>Again, not a word about the banks, despite the page's blurb which says: ?We will be updating and featuring your reviews and comments on a regular basis.?<br>The section has listeners' comments on topics as diverse as country music, cricket, mateship and the Kosovo refugees. At least a dozen of the 50 published letters deal with Toyota ownership as well as the use of the word ?bugger? in a Toyota television commercial.<br>Toyota is both a sponsor of Laws' radio program and of the Fortress site.<br>The Australian Bankers Association runs a site which deals mainly with PR releases that put the banks' views.<br>Like Laws' site, the bankers appear not to have judged the controversy newsworthy.<br>At the weekend, the most recent news releases - those tagged with a ?new? image - appeared to be published in May.<br>Topics included: Bank customers misled, banking industry applauds promotional funding, industry welcomes tax package and customers lose if GST defeated.<br>A site with a lot to say about the Laws case is the one run by Perth talkback radio host Howard Sattler.<br>Unlike Laws and his station 2UE - which is still building a Web site - Sattler and his station 6PR are active Web users.<br>For more than 18 months Sattler has used his site virtually as an adjunct to his radio show. His front page features the latest topics discussed on-air and the site runs regular opinion polls which allow users to vote on current issues.<br>The Laws controversy is treated in depth under a headline titled ?Golden tonsils tarnished?.<br>Sattler says Laws has given his critics plenty of ammunition with which to work ?with all manner of vitriol and little contrary evidence to shake them off his tail?.<br>He claims the main issue in the controversy is whether a broadcaster has been selling his on-air editorial comment.<br>Sattler has also had allegations made against him, and again has used his site to put his side of the case.<br>On a page called ?The saga continues? he accuses journalists and their newspapers of ignorance for reports that have linked him to the Laws scandal.<br>And in an appeal to his Web audience, he says: ?Only you will determine my future ... and if you believe I have let you down it is you who will remove me by simply switching off the radio.?<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority, which has announced inquiries into the Laws-banks deal, has published details in full at its What's New section.<br>The regularly updated page deals with a wide range of communication issues. At the weekend, two news releases about the Laws inquiries were sandwiched between others dealing with local content on TV, a community radio licence for Tamworth and the release of digital TV channels.<br>HELP DESK<br>John Laws' Fortress:<br>www.johnlaws.com<br>Australian Bankers Association:<br>www.bankers.asn.au<br>Howard Sattler:<br>www.sattler.com.au/main/<br>Australian Broadcasting Authority:<br>www.aba.gov.au/whats-new/<br>index.htm<br>Discussion group:<br>aus.media-watch<br></font></p>
