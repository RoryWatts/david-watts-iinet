            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE fine Hollywood actor Johnny Depp appears to love good wine. Slightly misleading evidence of this claim comes from the fact that he has the word ?WYNO? tattooed on his arm.<br>But that word would read as winno rather than whineo because it is the remnant of the time Depp had ?WINONA? tattooed to show his everlasting devotion to actress Winona Ryder. Because he is now very rich, he was able to have the N and A surgically removed and the I altered when he and Ryder split.<br>The real evidence for Depp's love of wine can be found in a British newspaper report earlier this week which said the star of, among others, What's Eating Gilbert Grape (more wino evidence surely) bought and consumed a bottle of 1978 Romanee Conti.<br>This purchase of the rare French burgundy is said to have set him back a trifling $28,050. It was enough to buy a new car. The cost of one glass would pay the annual fees at a reasonable private school, or put a rented roof over a homeless family no doubt.<br>Depp forked out the money during a romantic dinner with the current love of his life, French actress Vanessa Paradis, who, according to available pictorial evidence, is a real corker (more wino evidence I wonder?).<br>The couple were dining at the Mirabelle restaurant in London's ritzy Mayfair late in January. The bill is said to have come to about $43,000. Bearing in mind that Depp paid $28,050 for the wine, then one has to assume he and Paradis ate endangered species - both animal and vegetable.<br>Back to the wine. Any bottle from the Domaine de la Romanee Conti is expensive. It comes from a 1.8-hectare vineyard that produces only 667 cases of red burgundy a year.<br>To put the $28,050 bottle of "78 Romanee Conti in perspective: Depp could have bought 15 magnums of Grange Hermitage (a variety of vintages from 1979 to 1993) for $25,000 over the Internet from a cellar in Sydney. Or he could have bought a slightly less cheeky vintage of Romanee Conti at a Californian cellar for just over $7000.<br>None has the reputation of the "78 that Depp chose, however. And presumably few establishments have the cheek of the Mirabelle to charge such a ransom.<br>But what good did this fine wine do him? Under its influence, he and Paradis left the restaurant about 1am to be confronted by the good, old paparazzi. Despite $28,050 worth of French burgundy coursing through his veins, Depp became angry and threatened to snot assorted photographers with a lump of wood.<br>The police came and took him away for four hours before releasing him with a warning that in future such naughtiness would earn him time in porridge (or whatever London constables say).<br>Maybe the Romanee Conti was not to blame. It was possibly the stress of trying to indulge in a romantic evening to impress Paradis, who is pregnant to Depp.<br>And Depp is one hell of a romancer. His performance in Don Juan DeMarco, as a late 20th century man who believes he is the legendary Don Juan, made many a matron hot and bothered.<br>Mind you, Depp did not get anywhere near the 1926 cinematic Don Juan (played by John Barrymore) who is said by the Guinness Book of Records to have averaged one kiss every 53 seconds.<br>Maybe Depp and Paradis discussed marriage and this led to the actor's foul temper.<br>On the eve of the eve of Valentine's Day, it is instructive to remember the following:Valentine's Day is all about romantic love.Romantic love often leads to marriage.Marriage can go like this: a lonely bloke advertises in the personals ?Wife wanted?. He gets hundreds of replies saying ?you can have mine?.<br>You have been warned young lovers.<br></font></p>
