            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A cloud no bigger than a man's hand hovers over the future of the Web ? and it is blue and white.<br>Those are the ubiquitous colours of Microsoft. Bill Gates' software giant has been hailed in past weeks for the $200 million investment that looks as if it will stop spiritual rival Apple going down the gurgler.<br>One of the prices Apple paid for the injection was to agree to make MS Internet Explorer the default Web browser on its new computers.<br>Apple buyers will not only get a good computer, they will have access to an excellent browser.<br>Little separates MSIE and Netscape, maker of the Navigator browser that made the Web a popular phenomenon when it became widely available in 1995.<br>Netscape claimed more than 80 per cent of the browser market until MS really took it on last year with Internet Explorer 3.0. Within a month of MSIE 3.0's official free release last August, the browser scoreboard read Netscape 65 - MSIE 30. It hasn't changed radically since.<br>But soon all new Wintel machines and all new Apples will have MSIE as a default.<br>The decision for Net users boils down to this:<br>1. Do I blindly accept the very good MSIE Web browser supplied free to me by the wildly successful and mega-rich Microsoft company?<br>2. Do I do a bit of work and download and install the very good Navigator Web browser - and accept it is shareware - supplied by the wildly successful but not spectacularly rich Netscape company?<br>It is a tough one to which the obvious easy answer is choice 1.<br>After the MS-Apple deal, Netscape executives kept a cool public profile, saying they did not think MSIE on new Macs would alter user habits significantly.<br>Their rationale included the fact that many users of older Macs already had Netscape, that there was a big Netscape culture among all Net users and that they were confident people would exercise a bit of freedom of choice.(Netscape is currently shipping with OS8 as the default and will still be shipped with Macs after IE becomes the default.)<br>Freedom of choice is precisely what MS is eating away. Not only does it have the most commonly used personal computing platform in Windows (any flavour you like), it now holds a strong influence over Mac users. And now it could dominate the way the majority of people use the Net.<br>Not a bad position to be in. MS doesn't quite own the world but certainly may own a lot of the devices used to look at it.<br>Even before the MS-Apple deal, David Moschella of Computerworld magazine was agonising over the MS-Netscape battle. In a column published on Netscape's site he wrote somewhat prophetically:<br>?To me, the issue becomes ? a philosophical and moral one. Do you think it's fair for one very rich company to give away a product for the sole purpose of hurting a far less rich competitor??<br>Moschella obviously agreed that choice 1 of the two I presented was the easy way out. But he thought choice 2 a bit of a cop-out even though support for Netscape would promote vigorous rivalry and improve software development.<br>His theory is that the choice goes deeper, to questions of leadership of the information technology industry.<br>?A big part of leadership is earning the respect of others by doing what's right. If you agree that Microsoft's browser pricing is fundamentally predatory and that predatory pricing is wrong you shouldn't support it,? he said.<br>Just days after the MS-Apple deal, Annette Hamilton, of Ziff Davis Publishing's AnchorDesk Web site, was telling readers more about MS's behaviour.<br>She cited a study by non-profit technology watchdog NetAction that found: ?Microsoft's strong-armed marketing activities have robbed consumers of their freedom of choice.?<br>NetAction found that only two of the top 12 Internet service providers in the US gave consumers a choice by including Netscape with start-up software.<br>America Online, CompuServe and Internet MCI had agreed to supply customers only with Internet Explorer.<br>?Netscape, watch out. In the 1980s, Microsoft became determined to win the operating system war. And today Microsoft Windows operating system is installed on roughly 90 per cent of PCs on the market. Now the company is as determined to win the browser war,? Hamilton warned.<br>And, when all is said and done, the footsoldiers in this war are you, the consumers. The choices you make will be the bullets fired and the bombs dropped.<br></font></p>
