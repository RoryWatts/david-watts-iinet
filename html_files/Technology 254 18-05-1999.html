            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LIFE is pretty serious and complicated at the moment. Kosovo, Timor, the forests, and spies getting their cover blown on the Web. If that is not enough, Senator Brian Harradine decides against the GST.<br>Where that leaves the Federal Government's Internet censorship regulation - given that its critics saw it as a way to win over the Tasmanian senator - is unclear to say the least.<br>There is only one answer to all this heaviness ... an escape into the sort of time-wasting that only the Net can bring. One way to do this is to plug whatever comes to mind in the window of a search engine, then surf through the results to see where it takes you.<br>Senator Harradine has actually provided inspiration for such an escapist quest. He is on record as telling a Senate committee inquiry that one only has to type ?p? into the Web and all sorts of free smut result.<br>I decided to give it a go at the weekend, and see whether I might happen on consenting couples doing interesting things with whipped cream.<br>No such luck. I tried Web Wombat, Google, Excite, Web Crawler, HotBot and Alta Vista on the extremely fast FAST search engines.<br>Not a bean from three of them which objected that ?p? was not a word, and nothing more salacious than a page on the PS/2 mouse driver for serial port connections from the others.<br>Still seeking easy amusement, I headed for the Centre for the Easily Amused site. Prominent is a link to the Hampster Dance, the site that displays hundreds of furry cartoon characters dancing to some awful rockabilly music.<br>A silly waste of time and amazingly addictive, it has spawned more than 100 lookalike sites.<br>The centre has links to them all. There is even a Genetically Modified Hamster Dance.<br>People have created animated dances by pigs, sheep, ancient Romans, aliens, Austin Powers, Cartman from South Park, and vampires.<br>An American by the name of Melissa Ping has even launched the Animated Dancing Pages Web Ring to link them all together.<br>So anyone who has created a page of animated dancing characters with accompanying awful music can join the ring.<br>The Hampster Dance has even started selling posters and bumper stickers, according to Jack Schofield, the Guardian's computer editor.<br>He says the popularity of dancing pages has also produced an answer to the intriguing question: Why is hamster misspelt?<br>Schofield says the creators of Hampster Dance have announced: ?Everything here is named with a "p' because the name of the original Hampster Dancer is Hampton Hampster, a little hamster from Canada.?<br>The Net has an answer for everything.<br>HELP DESK<br>Search Engines: www.iinet.net.au/~watto/index1.<br>html#search<br>Centre for Easily Amused: www.amused.com<br>Animated Dancing Pages Web Ring: members.aol.<br>com/pinkbreez/index.html<br></font></p>
