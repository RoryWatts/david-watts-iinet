            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TODAY we will have to concentrate and work hard. Don't whine about it; school's been back more than a week now and I expect everyone to be into the routine of learning.<br>But what to learn? I think English is a good starting point. For those of us who have it as our native tongue, this may sound too easy. But put yourself in the place of someone who is learning English. Say they're Japanese, or Indonesian, or Swahili.<br>Here is the sort of thing they have to contend with. You walk into a Hungry MacTucky Red Pizza Treat and defiantly order chips ... nearly everyone over 35 refuses to call them French fries. ?Yes, fries sir; and would sir like fries with those?? asks the young hopeful behind the counter. It is galling to remember that one day this young Jason or Kylie may actually run the State or your local bank. ?And will sir be having fries and an apple turnover with that leveraged, equity access loan??<br>After buying our theoretical English student a packet of regular fries, er chips, er salt and cholesterol; you will have to enlighten them about the following food facts.<br>There is no egg in eggplant or ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England nor French fries in France (Belgium actually). Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.<br>After lunch, we amble off to sport. We cannot preamble, but we may try to perambulate. However, all this ambulatory stuff will lead to the back of an ambulance if we're not careful. First we sit in the stand but there is no sitting if we want to stand. If we're brutal enough to be at the boxing we will notice that the ring is in fact square. If at the footy our student will look in vain for pockets and it's a good thing they are far too much of a novice to know of rhyming slang and half-back flankers.<br>And forget cricket. The prospect of explaining cricket to anyone not born into it is frightening indeed. Square leg, silly mid-on, maidens bowled over, pull shots, England Test teams, googlies, chinamen and grubbers are way out of their league.<br>If you want to try, just start with this: a batsman goes out to bat when he is in and stays out while he is in, until he is out of course when he walks in to the dressing room.<br>Enough already. Now try these:<br>A guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham. The plural of tooth is teeth but beeth is not the plural of booth. We can have one goose and two geese but it's one moose and not two meese. (I believe Alaskans hate meeses to pieces).<br>You can make amends but not one amend, can comb through annals of history but not a single annal. Teachers have taught us but preachers haven't praught to us. Vegetarians eat vegetablesbut what does a humanitarian eat?<br>Or, have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown, met a sung hero or experienced requited love? Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable? And where are all those people who are spring chickens or who would actually hurt a fly?<br>???<br>LAST week I received word of some little gems called Darwin's Awards, given to individuals who, through single-minded self-sacrifice have done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. Here is a nominee:<br>Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December in North Carolina when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith & Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.<br></font></p>
