            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Some guys have all the luck; take any Victorian with a job, for example. In the past fortnight such people could have seen two of the best shows to grace the nation this year.<br>One was the AFL grand final between St Kilda and Adelaide on September 27, an event so big it needed Nathan Cavaleri, Marina Prior and Colleen Hewitt, among many others, just to kick it off.<br>Only four days later, those fortunate enough to survive massed choruses of The Pride of South Australia by wandering bands of jubilant Adelaide fans could have fronted up to the opening day of one of the most important art exhibitions seen in Australia.<br>The $7 million Rembrandt exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria is regarded as a masterpiece of masterpieces. More than 50 of the Dutch master's etchings and drawings, plus 28 of his paintings, have been brought from galleries in the US, England and Holland to Melbourne for the exhibition.<br>And if you are lucky enough to be in Melbourne you can see them and read about the life of a man who, during his life, reached great critical heights and made much money only to fall into financial trouble and die a pauper at 63 in 1669.<br>His legacy is some of the most famous portraiture in art history. Such was Rembrandt's reputation that it was once believed that he was responsible for more than 800 paintings.<br>Careful studies often using sophisticated dating methods have shown he painted about 300 of these works. A legion of copiers, many his own pupils, are responsible for many of the others.<br>And the National Gallery has more than 40 of these as well, displaying them alongside the master's, where Rembrandt's use of light and shade and his empathy for the human condition put the copies in their place.<br>Chances are that many in WA will not see the Rembrandts. A $400-plus airfare and $18 admission ticket puts the gallery out of reach for most.<br>But for the price of a phone call any Sandgroper with an Internet connection can wallow in a feast of Rembrandt's works ? and those of nearly all the great artists from Leonardo da Vinci to Matisse.<br>Nicholas Pioch's Web Museum is one of the older sites on the World Wide Web and one of the more popular. With the help of Encyclopedia Britannica and art lovers throughout the world, Parisian Pioch has assembled a site breathtaking for its simplicity and beauty.<br>He has virtual galleries of work by about 100 great artists available at the click of a mouse as well as informative biographies and descriptions of the great schools of art.<br>To take in the genius of Rembrandt, it is necessary only to find him in the artist's index, click and then tour one of the four galleries associated with him. In these, all you have to do is click on a thumbnail image of a painting and the enlarged version will fill your screen.<br>To make the most of this, it is best to have your screen resolution set to 256 colours or better. Anything less and the great self-portraits look like bad pieces of photocopying.<br>One of the best by-products of such a cheap Rembrandt exhibition is that you can decorate your computer room with a great work of art. A Rembrandt wallpaper on-screen is not to be sneezed at. It adds a touch of class.<br>In Windows, simply click the right mouse button while pointing at an image you like and choose ?set as wallpaper?.<br>Alternately, if you have a program such as PaintShop Pro you can copy the image to your computer and manipulate it to the shape you want - you can even create montages or barbaric mutations - then convert it to a bitmap (.bmp) for use as wallpaper.<br>The National Gallery of Victoria site has some basic information about the Rembrandt exhibition plus a potted biography of the master.<br>HELP DESK<br>National Gallery: www.ngv.vic.gov.au/rembrandt/<br>index.html<br>Web Museum: netspot.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/paint/<br>auth/rembrandt/<br>Britannica: www.eb.com<br>Paint Shop Pro: www.psp.com<br>Mitsui: www.mitsui.com.au/brochure/<br>powercc/pcen_pro.htm<br></font></p>
