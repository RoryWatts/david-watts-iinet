            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE man's fish is another man's poisson, as the French say. And what makes us laugh is as variable as Melbourne's weather, or Diana's neckline (a low blow).<br>If it isn't the Irish getting the rough end of the pineapple it's the Poles, or New Zealanders, or up to a couple of years ago blondes (How can you tell which computer the blonde is sitting at? It's the one with White-Out all over the screen).<br>It's all very unfair and utterly hilarious at the same time. The latest class of people to be the butt of others' humour is the viola player. Actually, viola jokes have been round for a few years, their uniqueness being considered worthy of comment in the Boston Globe in 1994.<br>But I haven't heard anyone in Perth tell a viola joke and found out there was such a genre of humour only after reading an article by US columnist Dave Barry.<br>The viola is, of course, that little instrument that looks like a violin. But it seems other serious musicians consider the playing of it to be a low-brow occupation. For example:<br>What's the difference between a viola and a coffin? The coffin has the dead person on the inside.<br>What's the difference between a viola and a trampoline? You take your shoes off to jump on a trampoline.<br>How can you tell when a violist is playing out of tune? The bow is moving.<br>Why do violists leave their instrument cases on the dashboards of their cars? 1. So they can park in disabled parking places, or 2. If someone mistakes them for mafia, they might get some respect.<br>Or ... a conductor and a violist are standing in the middle of the road, which one do you run over first, and why? The conductor. Business before pleasure.<br>This is pretty standard joke fare of course. You could substitute lawyer for violist and have a repetoire of familiar funnies.<br>What sets the viola joke apart is that it can be applied strictly to those who understand classical music or the ornate structure of a symphony orchestra. And why not? Serious musicians are not necessarily serious people all the time.<br>So, the viola joke also acts as a release for orchestral tensions. Consider these, and remember they could make the wind section giddy with mirth.<br>How do you get a viola section to play spiccato? Write a whole note with solo above it.<br>How do you get a violist to play a passage pianissimo tremolando? Mark it solo.<br>What's the definition of a minor second? Two violists playing in unison.<br>I didn't even begin to get those jokes because I can barely tell the difference between a piccolo and a saxophone. But also consider that viola jokes have a big following in Germany (a more sober-sided nation than ours), and pretty soon you can see that things can go beyond a joke.<br>Why is viola called bratsche in Germany? Because that's the sound it makes when you sit down on it.<br>(The next one is said to be a side-splitter in the German tongue, so we'll give it a whirl and then translate).<br>Was sind die drei Lagen auf der Bratsche? Erste Lage, Notlage, und Niederlage. (Translation: What are the three positions of the viola? First position, emergency, and defeat.)<br>As Manuel of Fawlty Towers would say: ?Que??<br></font></p>
