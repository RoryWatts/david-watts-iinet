            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT has been grabbing all the headlines with its exciting Internet Explorer 4.0 but Netscape's Communicator still has a lot to offer Internet users.<br>The most important option it gives is freedom of choice. MSIE 4.0 is, even in these early beta test days, a total shell for the operating system.<br>Users can opt just to use it as an Internet suite, but that defeats its radical purpose. MSIE takes over the computer, making it part of the Web; or conversely makes the Web just another part of the computer.<br>On the other hand, Netscape Communicator may take over most Net functions but it leaves the user with a great deal of choice about how they run the rest of their system.<br>One US user recently wrote to a Microsoft Explorer newsgroup with these opinions of MSIE 4.0: ?(The fact that MSIE 4.0 is free) is the only feature that really bugs me. Does anyone really believe that Microsoft gives away MSIE out of philanthropy? Explorer is free for two reasons only: to promote the Windows OS and to push Netscape out of the client market.?<br>Add that MSIE 4.0 is compatible only with Windows95 and NT4 so far, and there are plenty of grounds to believe Communicator will be a popular Net addition.<br>Communicator's main problem so far is that it is buggy and causes crashes. The lock-ups and freezes have lessened as new releases have come along, but the more favourable parts of the software are these:<br>Composer - the HTML editor is true WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). Its support for tables is enough to make it a winner over MSIE's disappointing FrontPad.<br>Mail and News - MSIE has made great strides in improving this feature, but Netscape is still better because the user can organise mail better, be notified more easily and read both words and pictures in mail or news faster.<br>Bookmarks - MSIE calls these Favourites. Whatever they are called, Netscape organises them more simply and allows users easy access by making them a .HTM file.<br>Interface - Communicator took a few leaves from earlier MSIE versions and trumped their look.<br>Browsing - It is early days, but Communicator, with the familiar Navigator browser, still seems to surf more smoothly than MSIE.<br>Familiarity - Netscape has dominated browsers since late 1994 and millions of people will feel no need to change.<br></font></p>
