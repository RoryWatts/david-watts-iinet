            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE way everyone from Prime Minister John Howard down (or up depending on your political stance) has carried on this week you would swear there is going to be an announcement from the Vatican.<br>The Pope: Is that Mr Howard?<br>Mr Howard: Yes Your Holiness, haven't seen Alexander Downer round there have you?<br>Pope: No big sporting events on here right now. How's the GST going by the way? Your goose been cooked yet?<br>PM: No, but you could say my chook has.<br>Pope: Never mind. I just thought I'd tell you we have created a new saint. It's Saint Shane, the patron saint of cricket.<br>PM: Bonza Your Holiness . . . though I don't know how that will go down with my fellow New South Welshmen.<br>Pope: Hey whatsa matter you? I suppose I could throw in Saint Steve and make him the patron saint of batsmen and then Saint Shane could be the saint of leg-spinners.<br>PM: Whacko, then we could have Saint Glenn of pacemen, Saint Mark of slip fieldsmen and Saint Adam of opening batsmen.<br>Pope: Now you'll forgive me, I have more important matters to attend to. Father Ted is on. Ciao (in Polish).<br>It could happen.<br>There are a lot of patron saints around and they guide people in endeavours nowhere near as worthy as World Cup cricket.<br>There is even a patron saint of journalism - Francis de Sales, a 16th century French nobleman who became a bishop then single-handedly converted 40,000 Calvinists in Switzerland back to Catholicism. His chief weapon was the pen with which he wrote sermons that were posted under the doors that had been shut in his face by reluctant Protestants.<br>So if mucky old journalists have a patron saint, why not our cricket champions?<br>The passion for sainthood shows no sign of abating. Earlier this month the Sunday Times in London revealed that moves were afoot to anoint a patron saint of the Internet.<br>?The Vatican is considering making a learned bishop who died more than 1400 years ago into the religious saviour of harassed computer users,? the paper said. The saint-in-waiting is Isidore of Seville who is credited with the creation of the world's first database in the form of a 20-volume encyclopaedia. Catholic Net users, particularly those in Spain, have been lobbying the Vatican to get their man the cyber title.<br>I turned to the Net to find out more about patron saints when I read about Isidore. Until I looked at the Catholic Church's Patron Sites site: (http://saints.catholic.org/patron.html), I was, like any bad protestant lad, only vaguely aware of Christopher, George, Patrick, Andrew, David and Jude (he of the lost causes and the desperate).<br>But as you can see by the Saint Francis de Sales revelation, I have now found a rich and tantalising list which will no doubt come in handy at a quiz night, particularly if it is run by a Catholic school.<br>Did you know there is a patron saint for taxi drivers (Fiacre), who rightly enough is also the patron saint of haemorrhoid sufferers? There is even one for arms dealers (Adrian of Nicodemia) while Our Lady of Mercy looks after both the Argentinian and Ecuadorian armies.<br>There appear not to be many patron saints of sporting events, although Jude would be an obvious candidate for punters or Collingwood supporters. But there is a patron purely for Belgian sportsmen and women (Mary, Our Lady of Chevremont).<br>It comes as no surprise then that there is also no patron saint of sporting commentators.<br>One who might miss a nomination is Channel 9's Simon O'Donnell. He was a good cricketer and footballer, but sometimes his efforts as a talking head leave the viewer just scratching theirs.<br>For example, one correspondent claimed Simon said this just two minutes into last Sunday's World Cup final: ?The Aussies wouldn't have butterflies this morning . . . they'd have caterpillars after already passing the moth stage.?<br>The saints preserve us.<br></font></p>
