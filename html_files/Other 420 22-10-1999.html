            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I LIVE in that part of Peppermint Grove called Mosman Park. This is an ideal vantage point from which to spy on the rich.<br>Such spying generally cannot be done during the day, however. The minute that valets, chauffeurs, nannies or maids who work for rich people see a wretch like me without a new Mercedes and dressed in clobber from Target, they send out the alarm signals.<br>?He's not rich. Look at his runners. They've got a Taiwanese brand name,? they shout before throwing rolls of velvet buffalo grass to make me - or any other money-challenged person - go in the direction of away. Thus, spying on the rich in the Grove is best done on dark, moonless nights using the luxuriant cover of the trees that abound in that suburb. The results are usually surprising.<br>Rich people do not have much of a life. On Saturday nights, in particular, it is even possible to feel quite sorry for them. Without the benefit of their offices or mega-wealthy enterprises being open on Saturday nights, the rich are forced to find shelter in their own houses. Once they select a room for the evening - ballroom, library, upstairs viewing gallery, whatever - they attend to a menial chore which keeps them solitary and indoors.<br>That is, they count their money.<br>If you wander through a rich suburb such as the Grove on a Saturday night, you too will see house after house with a single light on. If you crane your neck and cup your ear you will be able to just hear the gentle rustle of notes and perhaps a tired voice saying: ?One million, one hundred . . . one million, one hundred and twenty . . .? etc. It is symptomatic of life in a wealthy State, I guess. Evidence of this great wealth is everywhere.<br>I was thinking of taking my wheelchair for a spin along the new cycleway beside Mounts Bay Road, for example. The family could ride along on their bicycles to keep me company. But such is the wealth of our city and the importance attached to riches that I read this type of venture cannot be attempted yet. And quite right too. This cycleway is not finished. If it was, we wheelchair riders, people on bikes, joggers and pram pushers would present a terrible hazard. We could get in the way of rich folk trying to make their way from their new Swan Brewery apartment block to their sparkling new private jetty.<br>Just wouldn't do. Neither would anything but a Wedgwood tea set do to entertain the clients of Family and Children's Services Minister Rhonda Parker. I have no idea whether Ms Parker is rich in money but she certainly is rich in ideas. What a noble gesture it is to ensure her constituents - often the homeless, the abused and the needy - have nothing but the best when all they think they need is a nice cuppa.<br>As I bang my knees under the 40-year-old desk I paid $100 of my own money for years ago, I count my lucky stars that we live in such a wealthy place that allows Attorney-General Peter Foss to fork out more than $20,000 of mine (and other taxpayers) on a desk designed to stop him having headaches.<br>When I think of the $500,000-plus paid by the banks to hear rich radio type John Laws say nice things about their fees, I go all warm and fuzzy. This is the sort of place where image is important and certainly not cheap.<br>It's a bit like living in a TV show. Who Wants to be a Millionaire comes to mind.<br>And it's all starting to get a bit rich.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
