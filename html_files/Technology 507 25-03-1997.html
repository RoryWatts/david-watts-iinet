            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A GOOD picture is emerging on the World Wide Web of what Microsoft's successor to Windows95 will look like.<br>The Seattle-based software giant is coy officially, but among Internet users it is now fairly well known that Windows97 is under trial using the codename Memphis.<br>Several Web sites carry what they claim is valid information about Memphis gleaned from people who tested the operating system under Microsoft's beta program.<br>More evidence of the new generation is coming from preview tests of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 browser suite (codenamed Nashville), which Memphis is said to rely on heavily.<br>MSIE 4.0 should have been released as a beta download on the Web last week, but has been delayed until security fears that emerged on MSIE 3.0 and 3.01 are ironed out properly.<br>What the Web has been able to tell us about Memphis-Win97 so far is interesting but not revolutionary.<br>It is little surprise that the operating system will have a browser feel about it. Since Microsoft misjudged future directions about two years ago, founder Bill Gates has steered the company vigorously towards Net domination.<br>And so the user interface for Win97 is expected to look just like a Web browser.<br>Users will be able to navigate round their system by single-clicking on hyperlinked icons.<br>There is also a chance that Win97 will offer the choice of a Win95 or even a Win3.1 desktop to keep them comfortable.<br>There is no reliable date for a release of Win97 yet, though some sites say it is expected about August-September.<br>Win95 came to the market with the optimistic statement that it would run on enhanced 386s with 4Mb of RAM.<br>More realistically, fast 486s with 16Mb seemed to operate better.<br>A Pentium 120 with 16Mb seems to be the basic requirement, with many computer writers suggesting 32Mb of RAM.<br>This is expected to give a comfortable ride to enhancements which - in typical Microsoft fashion - look resource-hungry.<br>These are expected to include:<br>?A feature called SmartFavorites that will scan Web sites and flag any changed since the last visit.<br>? A Windows Driver Model that will allow drivers to work with both Window95 and NT.<br>? New Setup, redesigned for the Win95 upgrade to Memphis.<br>? Multiple Display Support - PCI machine users with two PCI display adapters will have the ability to use multiple displays.<br>? ACPI Power Management - a new power control that supports new hardware interfaces.<br>? Dr Watson 32 - Details buttons provide new advanced technical information to detect bugs.<br>? FAT32 - allows much better file handling on big hard disks, allowing files to reside on 4kb clusters, rather than 32kb ones.<br>? More drivers - still image and video capture, new modem drivers, new printer mini drivers.<br>? External devices will plug in using one of two new systems - the Universal Serial Bus for mice, keyboards, modems, scanners and removable drives, and the high-speed IEEE 1394 protocol for video teleconferencing, digital camcorders and VCRs.<br></font></p>
