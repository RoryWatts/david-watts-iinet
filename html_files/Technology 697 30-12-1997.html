            <h3>Author: HAL CRAWFORD; DAVID WATTS; SUE YEAP</h3>
            <h3>Date: 30-12-1997</h3>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Internet and World Wide Web are in constant flux. The site you loved yesterday may be offline next week.The technology of the page you designed last year may be laughed at today. But some sites grow bigger, stronger and more popular with every visitor that ticks over their counters. This week, HAL CRAWFORD, DAVID WATTS and SUE YEAP share their favourite 10 Web sites of 1997. We hope you may find some of them worthy of at least one, if not repeat visits.<br>Hal Crawford<br>Computer writer<br>AltaVista: www.altavista.yellowpages.com.au<br>OK, it's boring but it's true - the Australian AltaVista site is far and away the site I pull up the most. No matter what I am investigating, I will always look at AltaVista first. The site - with the advantage of the Australian server - loads in a few seconds, then returns its results with similar alacrity.<br>I generally find the results are of some use, even if I have to trawl through a couple of pages of matches to get what I want. Because I have taken the trouble to learn the engine's protocols, I find this site way ahead of the others.<br>I know there are far more comprehensive search engines out there but for reasons of crude ease of use and familiarity, I always try AltaVista first. There is also the bonus of the engine being on the same site as the excellent Yellow and White Pages.<br>MacCentral: maccentral.com<br>This is another page which invariably makes an appearance on my browser every day, even if I am using a Windows machine. The combination of an excellent news format for the Web and rock-solid news items make for what has become the news source for most Mac users on the Net.<br>MacCentral uses a title page with one-line story links to give you an overview of what's been happening. Click on one of the links and, instead of loading up just the one yarn, you get the whole day's worth. Somehow it just works for me.<br>As well as news items on everything to do with the turbulent world of Apple and a lot besides, the site provides Macintosh updates, demos, and shareware as they hit the Net.<br>Happy Puppy: www.happypuppy.com<br>They call themselves the No. 1 game site on the Web and they are pretty much spot-on. Happy Puppy provide the latest demos and shareware games for PCs and Macs and do it in such a colourful way they have earned a place in many a gamer's bookmark file.<br>If you find yourself with any free time, you can always find a game to amuse you for a few hours at Happy Puppy. The only problem is the files are getting so notoriously big that the download times stretch into hours - and then you risk the frustration of losing it all at the last minute.<br>Cyberian Outpost: www.cyberianoutpost.com<br>If you are ready for the leap of faith that is Internet shopping, then you are ready for Cyberian Outpost. This comprehensive and reliable Internet shop has a huge array of computer equipment available, no matter what platform you are into.Software, hardware, games, printers, cameras, scanners - if it involves the digital domain, you can buy it here and have it shipped to you house within days. Just make sure you have enough credit on that card.<br>Access has found the biggest problem with getting goods from the US (from whence Cyberian Outpost operates) are hold-ups at Australian customs. Apart from these small delays, getting goods from these guys is very easy.<br>WA Writers' Resource Site: argo.net.au/shauna<br>This site, put together by Shaun Anthony, a journalist with The West Australian, provides an invaluable list of links for anyone trying to do research on the Net. Anthony divides the information available into divisions typically seen in the newsroom, with sections such as science, politics, and police and crime as well as non-newspaper areas such as links to fiction on the Web.<br>With the emphasis on WA sources of information, where they exist, then Australian sources, this site is one of the few attempts to get local in the global age. The site, while aimed at journalists, should be worthwhile for many people.<br>Alt.culture: www.pathfinder.com/altculture<br>You know the feeling - you are totally bored with the Net and you can't think of one thing which could possibly amuse you. Instead of disconnecting and powering down the computer like you should, go to the alt.culture site and hit the ?random? button. Then one of the 990-odd insightful and intelligent pieces on modern culture will pop up on your screen and you will be enriched for five minutes.<br>The site is based on Steven Daly's and Nathaniel Wice's book of the same name, and claims to be ?both culture guide and online compass?.I just find it good for a laugh. Whether they are dealing with mall-culture or death-metal, Daly and Wice really hit the spot. Five new entries are added every week.<br>Megastories: www.megastories.com<br>This is Internet publishing at its best - insightful feature news stories in a format which goes beyond the abilities of traditional print publications. Megastories incites readers to ?step beyond the sound bite? because ?facts are not enough? and that is just what they do. World news stories such as investigations of the Korean economy, Bosnian atrocities, and Boris Yeltsin's health are not changed often, but when they are, they're worth reading.<br>The site's great feature on Saddam Hussein will long remain in my memory as an excellent example on how information can be layered on the Web.<br>Project Gutenberg: www.prairienet.org/pg/pg_home.html<br>The thought of carrying around a small library full of books in just one notebook computer is an appealing one and possible given the immense capacities of CD-ROMs and other storage devices - but first you have to get your hands on the electronic texts and solve the copyright problems. You know anything you get at the Project Gutenberg site will be of impeccable legality and probably a classic in some sense.<br>Project Gutenberg, started in 1971, has the grand aim of turning all the major works of literature into e-texts. It has completed only just over 1000 titles but with the rate of scanning and optical character recognition increasing, it is worth checking back to see if a text you fancy has come online.<br>HotWired: www.hotwired.com<br>The Net presence of paper magazine Wired (regarded by many as a bible of digital culture) is a fairly professionally run unit despite all the criticism heaped on the organisation. With the same lurid colours as Wired, HotWired presents features from the magazine as well as weekly news items and oddities like its online RGB gallery.<br>I still like it.<br>MacWorks: www.macworks.com<br>I have already included Cyberian Outpost, which is an excellent Net mega-store but for the more personal touch you cannot go past specialists such as the American MacWorks operation. Selling only hardware relating to the Macintosh, this operation will make sure you get everything right and can better most prices available elsewhere.<br>The Net is perfect for this kind of niche marketing at a distance.<br>Sue Yeap<br>Access editor<br>Yahoo: www.yahoo.com<br>If Yahoo shut down I would be lost. This site is my first stop when I am looking for anything to do with lifestyle and entertainment.It has a comprehensive list of musicians and bands and the computer listings are also good for tracking down that elusive piece of freeware or some nifty Web graphics.<br>Yahoo recently expanded its regional guides to Australia (add .au after .com), making country-specific searches possible.And if you are bored with IRC, get the iChat plug-in and try Yahoo's chat for a change. Other Yahoo highlights include Yahooligans for kids and Beatrice's Web Guide, a collaboration with Women's Wire.<br>Lycos: www.lycos.com<br>If not using Yahoo, I'll usually be using Lycos, which is my default home page on both Navigator 4 and IE4. The Lycos Web Guides on subjects ranging from fashion and health to computers and sport make searching simple even if you don't know much about search parameters. And the top 5 per cent guides further help sort the weed from the chaff.News briefs on the front page help keep you up to date with world events and crucial decisions (nanny case, Oklahoma bombing, etc).<br>Internet Movie Database: us.imdb.com<br>If you have even a passing interest in movies, you should have this site in your bookmarks. Search for actors, directors, producers. Follow the links to official movie studio sites or read reviews from sources such as esteemed Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert or USA Today.Settle that bet over how many times Sean Connery and Roger Moore have played James Bond or how many versions there have been of The Scarlet Pimpernel.There is also an Australian mirror site but I've always preferred this one.IMDB boasts entries for more than 126,210 movies and 7598 TV series - so you're bound to find what you're looking for.<br>Addicted To Noise: www.addict.com, www.addicted.com.au<br>Although I haven't visited this site quite as often as I did in my former guise as editor of the REVUE music liftout, there is still little to rival ATN on the Web, musically speaking. It simply makes subscriptions to music mags redundant.You may not find the latest goss on Mariah Carey or Celine Dion but if your tastes run to the more alternative (think Prodigy, Everclear, Green Day) this is the one stop for news, reviews and well-written interviews.For more Australian news, visit the newly launched Australian site. Or for the latest on live concert Netcasts and streaming music videos, follow the links from ATN to its sister site SonicNet.<br>Soundcellar: www.soundcellar.com<br>I've often found navigating the Web site of UK music weekly New Musical Express a slow experience, so I was overjoyed when they broke away the CD reviews into this separate site.The accent tends to be on British acts such as Radiohead, The Verve and Blur. Single and album reviews are updated every Tuesday and the search archive is relatively easy to use - although it doesn't always show the most logical result first.<br>cnet: www.cnet.com<br>The expansive cnet stable has something for everyone. At the main site you can read general computing and Net features as well as news summaries. Get ?tech news first? at News.Com. Find files galore at Download.Com or dig up some Web tips at Builder.Com.My favourites are the How To Guides on the main site, dealing with topics such as Palm Pilot Tips and Tricks, Can You Stop Spam? and Beyond The Browser.cnet's intuitive sites know what computer platform you are using and this is reflected in search results, most notably at Download.Com (although this can be a pain if you want to check PC titles from a Mac).The Digital Life features, such as how to avoid net crime and the dark side of the Web, also make good reading.<br>Calvin's' Palm Pilot FAQ: www.pilotfaq.com<br>If you own a 3Com (ex-US Robotics) Palm Pilot organiser or have contemplated buying one (my life would be a financial disaster if it wasn't for the Pilot) then this is the place to go.Find out about known bugs and how to fix them, the latest in free and shareware software and accessories, talk to other users. Who needs Windows CE anyway?It's mostly text but by golly it's useful and is constantly updated. It's also part of a Web ring linking to more than 100 other Pilot sites.<br>The Palace: www.thepalace.com<br>I've never been keen on IRC but the discovery of the delightful graphic interface offered by The Palace lead to many late nights and bleary mornings talking to people all over the world.I haven't been back for a while or paid up for the full registration (which enables you to wear costumes of your choice instead of looking like a bloated M&M once the demo version expires) but I can see the temptation returning this holiday season.Food Online: www.cucina.iol.it/<br>This is a gem of a site for anyone interested in cooking. It has a comprehensive list of ingredients and what they can be used for. And if you're sick of being asked what's for dinner, it is also jam-packed with Italian-oriented recipes ranging from Tuscan toasts and fried peppers to sage-flavoured beef stew.There are notes on wine tasting and all sorts of other delights but no pictures to accompany the recipes. I guess we can't expect too much for free.<br>Mr Showbiz: www.mrshowbiz.com<br>The latest goss and news from the entertainment world, film reviews and irreverent games that poke fun at the stars make this one of the most entertaining sites on the Web.The James Bond Sequeliser invites you to fill in the blanks and create your own pitch for the 19th 007 film.Then there's my favourite, the Plastic Surgery Lab. When I first visited this site more than a year ago, it was the faces of the stars of Friends you could rearrange.Now it's a bevy of supermodels like Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. But there's also a Lab archive including the casts of Friends, Seinfeld and the Best Actress Oscar nominees.<br>David Watts<br>Internet writer<br>Project Cool: www.projectcool.com<br>Glenn Davis, a Web pioneer, started Project Cool after he became disenchanted with Cool Site of the Day, which he helped create. He felt the drive to present innovation had been lost in favour of populism and corporatism at CSOD. Project Cool is a showcase for emerging design developments such as style sheets and layers. It shows the brave new world of dynamic HTML as a beautiful thing. In the process, it explains how it works, which is also a beautiful thing.<br>Lighthouse on the Web: werple.net.au/ ~dwalker/<br>front03.htm<br>A neatly presented site about Web sites and much more. Melbourne Age journalist David Walker specialises in economics but in his spare time takes on the world of HTML and Web design. He has assembled an excellent resource for beginner and expert alike, covering everything you need to know about making your statement to the world via the Web.<br>BBC News On Air: news.bbc.co.uk/hi/<br>english/on_air/default.htm<br>The BBC's news site is certainly an authoritative one, rounding up and constantly updating news from around the world. It is as good as, if not better, than CNN on the Web.But the undoubted highlight is the ability to watch the Beeb's major TV bulletins on screen via RealPlayer. The three bulletins can be seen live at 9pm, 2am and 5am Perth time, or accessed easily from the on-site archive.A 28.8Kbps connection is a minimum because of the crystal-radio-like reception of RealPlayer video. But it can be done and that is a big plus.I wonder if British Prime Minister Tony Blair knows we in Australia haven't paid our TV licences.<br>Slate: www.slate.com<br>Good writing, good news summaries and a good, clean, if quirky interface, add class to Slate. With Salon and Suck, it has become almost revered as an example of good Web publishing.The summary of US newspapers and magazines may sound parochial but there is a true world flavour here.<br>Nicholas Pioch's Web Museum: netspot.city.unisa.edu.au/wm/paint/<br>The Web Museum has been around since the Web became popular and is possibly one of the reasons it became so. To take in such art treasures from your armchair is one of the treats of connecting to the Net.The works of hundreds of artists - from Michelangelo to Mondrian to Monet; from Pissaro to Picasso and from Da Vinci to Van Gogh - are all here. Click on the thumbnails for a big picture or read about the artists' lives courtesy of kind sources at Encyclopedia Britannica, or fill your head with knowledge and beauty.<br>Baggy Green Web Site: www.interprop.com.au/baggygreen/<br>A different kind of beauty and knowledge can be found at this ambitious Australian site. The cricket lover loves statistics almost as much as the actual game. And the Baggy Green site sure has some facts and figures to tantalise, including the batsmen who made 99 in a Test innings, those who made a duck on debut and the leading wicket-takers and run-makers of all time. It is a work in progress with the promise of many more stats to come.<br>HotBot: www.hotbot.com<br>A fairly new entrant in the search engine field, this creation of the gurus of cool at HotWired is pretty good. It's fast, accurate and comprehensive with its results, putting it in a similar league to AltaVista. It looks good, comes to screen quickly and has all important links to HotWired's stable of slightly off-the-wall sites.<br>Bibliomania: www.bibliomania.com<br>Doomsayers think the Net and computers are the end of literature. Bibliomania makes such claims a nonsense. Thanks to copyright laws that allow publication years after the death of an author, this site is able to present a host of wonderful writers and their words. You can read four novels by Jane Austen for a start. There are more than 30 other novels online. Most are in HTML and a few require the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug-in to read the files.New arrivals to whet the appetite include the Complete Works of Lewis Carroll. A rattling good read is guaranteed. If non-fiction, ancient texts or poetry are more to your liking; Bibliomania has them too.<br>Drudge Report: www.drudgereport.com<br>Putting it crudely, there is more news than you can poke a stick at here. The Drudge Report looks pretty plain but has links to hundreds of papers, magazines, journals, news agencies and television and radio outlets. It is a news junkie's playground.<br>Beyond the Black Stump Software: werple.net.au/ ~lions/software.htm<br>The beauty of this site is that it links to Australian software repositories where possible. This makes for faster downloads at whatever speed you have. It is not as comprehensive as Tucows or Download.Com, nor as pretty but it can often provide the software you want quickly.Programs are categorised exhaustively for easier navigation and the new arrivals link and search functions make finding what you want easy.<br></font></p>
