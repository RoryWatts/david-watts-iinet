            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">UNCERTAINTY reigns over the future of Internet censorship in Australia, despite the clear guidelines delivered to the Federal Government more than a month ago.<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority's seven-chapter report, weighing in at 500Kb on the World Wide Web, spelt out the need for a code of industry conduct and self-regulation.<br>But the failure of State attorneys-general a month ago to do no more than acknowledge the ABA report as the national model for cyberspace censorship has prompted Electronic Frontiers Australia to call for user input in the argument.<br>The EFA called last week for user comment on the ABA report. EFA chairman Kim Heitman said IAPs could wind up with lengthy jail terms under the States' plans.<br>?Existing law covers crime and child pornography on the Net,? Mr Heitman said. ?Any new regulations will be directed against controversial material presently legal.?<br>He said the next standing committee of attorneys-general in Canberra on October 25 would make definite decisions about censorship.<br>The biggest task for the EFA was to stop heavy-handed legislative approaches.<br>He asked Net users to e-mail responses to the ABA report to him for inclusion in the EFA comment. The deadline is August 25.<br>???<br>PRINCESS Diana looks stunning in fishnet stockings, suspenders and whip ... and an American football helmet on her head.<br>She is not quite as fetching in nun's habit and cowboy hat, though.<br>These bizarre dress combinations and many more are courtesy of the The Living Doll site at Club Di, part of the Royal Network which is maintained by republican-spirited Americans.<br>The Shockwave-enhanced site blares a thumping dance tune in .WAV format in the background as you mess with Di's attire.<br>Forms are provided to say how you would handle Princess Di, world peace and countries threatening to leave the Commonwealth.<br>Public spirited Netizens can then move to the Fergie Foundation where they can pledge differing amounts of cyberbucks (an uncertain currency) to keep Sarah Ferguson from the poor house.<br>Pledges are measured as ?Budgies? in honour of Fergie's children's books; ?Pedicures? for her toe-sucking needs; and ?Texans? in honour of the biggest sucker of them all, John Bryan, her financial adviser.<br>It is also possible to write your own front page headlines linking royals with show business stars like Madonna or Michael Jackson and have them displayed in a fictitious London tabloid.<br>That plus royal gossip and a feedback page for public thoughts on regal matters make the Royal Network eminently bookmarkable ... but probably not by royal appointment.<br>???<br>A CONVICTED murderer on death row in Texas has used a Perth Internet service to protest his innocence and ask for help in fighting his case.<br>Raul Villarreal has sent an e-mail message to the Bit Media personal classified pages on the World Wide Web. The long message, in English and Spanish, is sandwiched between lonely hearts-type ads from around the world.<br>Villarreal says he has been denied justice in Texas and accuses the state of fabricating evidence against him in a murder-robbery.<br>?My anguished mother is helping to prove my innocence,? he writes. ?I did not commit any crime and (am) desperately seeking legal and financial assistance to help me.?<br>He says the Houston Chronicle newspaper labelled his trial a circus and that the case held centre stage for all Texas media during 1993.<br>URLs<br>EFA e-mail - kheitman@it.com.au<br>ABA report - http://www.dca.gov.au/aba/olsrprt.html<br>EFA - http://www.efa.org.au<br>Princess Di - www.royalnetwork.com<br>Paul Villareal - plato.bitme.com.au:80/ppersonals/list.html<br></font></p>
