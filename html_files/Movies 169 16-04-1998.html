            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE WEDDING SINGER HHH12<br>Former Hollywood bad girl Drew Barrymore is as sweet as an angel in this romantic comedy about a reception hall waitress named Julia who wants nothing more than to be happily married. The only problem is she starts to think that perhaps her betrothed - a big, blond, hunky and successful businessman - may not attach the same romantic notions to the institution of marriage as she does, primarily because he shows a definite lack of interest in their wedding plans. She meets Robbie, the wedding singer at the reception hall (played by Adam Sandler), who also harbours dreams of settling down in domestic bliss and achieving his dream of becoming a songwriter. After Robbie is left standing at the altar at his own wedding, he and Julia become friends. Will they see their perfect match is right under their noses before it's too late? The Wedding Singer is set in the ugly 80s with costumes that will make you cringe in fright that you too may have been seen walking the streets in something similar. Stone-wash jeans, studded belts, vinyl jackets, pastel shirts and blow-waved hairdos are paraded on screen to tunes by The Cure, Boy George and Billy Idol. The blond-haired punk with the famous snarly lip even makes a cameo appearance in the film. Rated M (Carolyn Martin)<br>AIR BUD<br>Yet another film about a canine of uncanny intelligence, this latest being a former circus performer called Buddy who has Michael Jordan-like hoop skills. Not content to sit on the sidelines as the team's mascot, Buddy bounds on to court during a big game and sinks a basket, giving his owner's struggling high school basketball team a shot at the championship. Doesn't sound promising but one respected critic claims that Air Bud has ?freshness and energy? and that ?the climactic scenes are not only absurd and goofy but also enormously entertaining?. Rated G (Not previewed)<br>THE BORROWERS HHHH<br>Based on Mary Norton's popular 1950s children's stories about a miniature family who exist by stealing - make that ?borrowing? - the necessities of life from ?human beans?, The Borrowers is a marvel of old and new special effects technology, with the little people beautifully integrated into their oversized world. We've seen this kind of thing before in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, but The Borrowers is far more inventive, giving us a mind-boggling view of the universe beneath the floor and behind the walls. Also, the top-notch design team has devised a world that combines a storybook London of the 1950s and the brown, moth-eaten surrealism of the Coen brothers' Barton Fink. Will keep big and little holidaying humans very amused. Rated G (Mark Naglazas)<br>HOME ALONE 3 HH12<br>A pity John Hughes didn't think to put the now-engaged Macaulay Culkin into this third instalment of the hugely successful series and call it Home Alone With The Wife. It might have freshened up material that felt stale when Home Alone 2 came out. Once again a kid (Alex D. Linz in the Culkin role) is left at home to fend for himself, this time against a band of terrorists who believe there is a valuable computer chip hidden inside the tyke's toy car. While the earlier Home Alone films at least tried to make the youngster's genius for setting painful traps plausible, the third edition severs all ties with reality, giving Alex near-clairvoyant ability to second-guess the baddies. The result is a predictable, violent cartoon of a movie which will have kids whooping and parents wincing. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>LEAVE IT TO BEAVER HHH<br>This reworking of an old sitcom laden with dreams of Mom's apple pie and small-town USA is as relevant to 90s Australians as the Turkish constitution. But director Andy Cadiff lightly spoofs the great American dream - Barbie-like housewives doing the vacuuming in pearls and high-heels - so nicely that the tale of a cute eight-year-old's battle for a bike becomes a pleasant family viewing experience. Even though it looks like a homage to materialism and suburbia it turns out to be a likeable essay about parenting and unconditional love. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>LOST IN SPACE HHH<br>There's danger, Will Robinson! It's there at every turn - crumbling planets, crashed spaceships, a rogue robot, the corrupt Dr Zachary Smith, even family dysfunction - as the space-age scientific family (headed by William Hurt and Mimi Rodgers) set out on to colonise a new planet with Earth facing extinction within 20 years. Witty one-liners keep the dialogue alive while amazing special effects steal the show, especially the scene in which Will uses virtual reality and hologram technology to take over the crippled robot and fight off a hoard of alien spiders. If the 60s TV show was camp, this one is pure corn. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>MORTAL KOMBAT ANNIHILATION<br>In this sequel to Mortal Kombat, based on the video game of the same name, Outworld Emperor Shao-Kahn has changed the rules of the game. He is coming in person with his extermination squads and even the elder gods are powerless to stand in his way. It is up to the survivors of Mortal Kombat and their new allies - former special forces member Jax (Lynn Red Williams), with cybernetically controlled titanium arms, Jade (Irina Pantaeva), a beautiful refugee from Outworld, and the native American Shaman Nightwolf (Litefoot) - to stand and fight. Fans of the video games will recognise the characters from all three of the Mortal Kombat series. Rated M (Not reviewed)<br>RUDYARD KIPLING'S SECOND JUNGLE BOOK: MOWGLI AND BALOO<br>A prequel of sorts to the popular Jason Scott Lee movie of a couple of years ago, this Jungle Book deals with the young Mowgli being pursued as the next curiosity for the PT Barnum circus. While this latest Kipling movie has been criticised for lack of imagination and racial and cultural stereotyping, the meshing of man and beast, live action and animation, is said to be very impressive. Sounds like one for the younger brigade. Rated G (Not previewed)<br>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY HHHH<br>Those who thought Woody Allen, after the sweet inconsequentiality of his most recent films, would go gentle into that good night will get a jolt with Deconstructing Harry. Allen has descended into the dark night of his artistic soul and given birth, kicking and screaming, to a self-centred, pill-popping, skirt-chasing, foul-mouthed novelist named Harry Block who, in his own words, is good with words but has no talent for life. Bitter, black and drenched in self-loathing, this portrait of The Meanest Man on Earth (Allen's original title for the movie) is the writer-director's most original and envelope-pushing work for at least a decade. At the Windsor and Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>THE BIG LEBOWSKI HHHH<br>Recent converts to the Coen brothers cult, those who came on board with the relatively straightforward Fargo, are in for a rude shock with The Big Lebowski, another of their clever but puzzling, maddeningly inconsequential genre spoofs. Hardcore Coen worshippers, however, won't mind because this send-up of the Chandler-esque detective yarn, starring Jeff Bridges as a lazy, dope-smoking 60s left-over in the Phillip Marlowe role, is one of the funniest movies in ages. It is a wonderfully acted, laugh-out-loud knockabout comedy with several dazzlingly photographed, hilarious druggy dream sequences. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>MERCURY RISING HH12<br>There's a half-decent idea in Mercury Rising - it's about an autistic boy and math genius who becomes the target of US government agents after cracking a billion dollar encryption system - but this quickly evaporates as the film falls back into depressingly familiar action-thriller mode. Bruce Willis brings a gritty humanity to the part of the FBI agent who defies orders and protects the boy. But the movie is diminished by the beefy Alec Baldwin whose ham-fisted acting style would be more in keeping with a James Bond flick than this attempt at a vaguely realistic thriller. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>ALICE IN THE CITIES HHHH<br>Those whose experience of Wim Wenders extends only to the disappointing The End of Violence might want to check out one of the early German films that established his laid-back style and secured his reputation. The road movie Alice in the Cities stars Wenders' favourite Rudiger Vogler as a photo-journalist who returns to Germany from an American assignment lumbered with a feisty nine-year-old girl. Alice in the Cities combines the visual poetry of American directors such as John Ford with a European intellectual questioning and obliqueness. ?It is fragmentary, meandering and proof of Wenders' eye and ear for inconsequential scenes that build into a subtle mood,? writes David Thompson of Alice in the Cities, nailing the key to Wenders' delicate style that in later years has hardened into art house cliche. The Cinematheque screens each Saturday afternoon at the Cinema Paradiso. For details of times consult the Ace Cinemas advertisement in The West Australian on Saturday.
