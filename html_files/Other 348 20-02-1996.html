            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ELECTION campaigns, like life, weren't meant to be easy.<br>But there is still room for fun and, on the Internet, gross irreverence.<br>This campaign has brought out the serious side of the Net but also highlighted the mocking style of many Net sites, which, when faced with something grim, turn to parody, satire and at times gross sarcasm.<br>The Toxic Custard Political Circus site on the World Wide Web continues a tongue-in-cheek approach to politics that has been a staple ingredient of Australian life since last century when artists at the Bulletin and Smith's Weekly deflated many a pompous buffoon.<br>The Toxic Custard site features a mock ?great debate? in which Prime Minister Paul Keating and Opposition Leader John Howard exchange taunts like naughty schoolboys.<br>The dialogue is mostly along the lines: ?Yes we did?, ?No you didn't?, ?Did?, ?Didn't?, ad infinitum.<br>Toxic Custard also presents a manifesto from the Hippy Party whose promises include:<br>?Good vibes and cooperation between political rivals by giving them all some really good weed.<br>?Taxes on bad karma and heaviness.<br>?Tax incentives for beards and grants for underarm hair for our feminine sisters in the community.?<br>Hand in hand with the hippies is an opinion poll which gives these choices to the Howard or Keating question:<br>?Keating's a complete idiot.<br>?Howard's a complete idiot.<br>?Both Howard and Keating are complete idiots.?<br>The entire site is topped off by a fake - we hope - message from the Australian Electoral Commission: ?Australia is a democracy. Participate or else.?<br></font></p>
