            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">www.hcourt.gov.au<br>The highest court in the land has had a busy time of late with the waterside workers' dispute. If you want to learn the gritty details, this site provides transcripts of major cases. Be warned, there is little flowing prose here. The legal process, as it must, is exacting and detailed. You will find pages just listing respondents to cases, followed by pages listing the judge's queries about who represents those respondents. All that before the issues are tackled. But it is democracy online; a way of getting closer to the processes that shape our lives. Also on show is the court calendar, a history, judgments, speeches and a feedback forum as well as links to other sites dealing with legal matters. (DW)<br>Mu Magazine<br>hedgehog.highway1.com.au/ ~mu<br>Perth-based ?global subculture magazine? mu has set up shop in cyberspace, taking its contemporary and edgy mix of music, art and fashion to a potentially worldwide audience. The first thing you notice about this site is its sharp, funky and functional design. The fashion section has collections entitled The Hunt and The Last Orgy. The Hunt's images seem quite feral, but it's hard to tell at thumbnail size. The global section has excerpts from an interview with a Tokyo fetish designer and lollipop has, erm, something best not viewed by kiddies. Music has interviews with and reviews of artists including Goldie and Swervedriver. The mu catchphrase is ?Lollipop Culture for the Accelerated Generation? and here you can get a quick taste. Perhaps in time the online content will match the design quality (SY)<br>Orange Sunshine Psychedelic 60s Radio<br>www2.orangesunshine.com/<br>orangesunshine<br>For baby-boomers needing a hit of nostalgia, this site delivers an almost lethal dose. It is the online version of a San Francisco radio station that plays only music from the time of flower power, the late 60s. (It does go a little into the 70s too, but not as far as disco). Again it is a RealPlayer-enhanced site. The audio and video plug-in is becoming the must-have appliance for Web surfers. With it you will be able to hear, among others: The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Janis Joplin, The Doors, Santana, Led Zeppelin, The Moody Blues, Jefferson Airplane, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, The Band and Arlo Guthrie . . . the list goes on and is made up only of the legends of rock (if you are 40-something). To pluck some phrases from that time, it's far out and groovy. (DW)<br>Frank Sinatra Shrine<br>www.nj.com/sinatra<br>Frank Sinatra's home town is Hoboken, New Jersey. It is not surprising, then, that the New Jersey Star-Ledger newspaper's New Jersey Online calls this site the Frank Sinatra Celebrity Shrine. The famous crooner and actor seems indestructible after all his years at the top which has left in its wake anthems like My Way and New York, New York. At the shrine you will find film and sound clips of Sinatra's marvellous career, a photo gallery and a selection of stories about the man. The highlight though - if you have RealPlayer 5.0 - is the streaming video documentary of the man. As the site says ?it's a gas, baby?. (DW)<br>Who Dares Wins<br>www.whodareswins.com.au<br>You don't have to be totally mad to go on the popular television show Who Dares Wins - but it must help. This site lists the top 10 dares accepted by people and performed on national TV. It is a little hard to find these dares at first, but they are under the Interactive link. Once discovered, you'll see that ordinary Australians have swum with crocodiles, bungee jumped from a helicopter and swung from a cable car. The Interactive area allows you to nominate some poor unsuspecting friend for a dare, suggest dares for the show or vote on the most popular. Fascinating information is also on hand. Did you know the show has done 383 dares, given away more than $300,000 in cash and sent 142 people around the world on luxury holidays? In accomplishing this, it has written off 13 cars, six motorbikes and one hovercraft; and hired 61 helicopters and planes, chartered 41 boats and had ambulances on standby for 213 days. (DW)<br>Idiots Anonymous<br>www.starwon.com.au/ ~joeking/<br>index.html<br>You have to wonder about a site which proudly displays a banner saying it's part of Link Exchange's Useless Pages. And assaults the ears with carnival-like MIDI sounds. Still, what can you expect from a site called Idiot's Anonymous, that has a motto of ?since I don't know who I am, nobody else can?. The aims of Idiot's Anonymous include to provide nothing, to do nothing and to find a stupider way around everything. Members go by silly names like Flicka and Grand High Noggin. The site, allegedly created using just three brain cells (and quite probably a severely limited colour palette), does have some reasonable links. The makers, who shall remain anonymous, are part of a growing number of Netizens whose sites have apparently no reason for being whatsoever. (SY)<br>Time Vortex - Dr Who Online<br>Time-Vortex.home.ml.org<br>Sci-fi fans are a dedicated bunch and reader Chris Thompson is no different. His Dr Who site has an archive of all things Dr Who, from links to downloadable start up and shut down screens, to pictures of John Pertwee and Tom Baker, even Tardis themes for Windows95. He also has a RealAudio chamber (which was temporarily closed at the time of my visist) of Dr Who clips and a comprehensive episode guide covering the work of the eight actors who have filled Dr Who's shoes. There's also a collection of links to other Dr Who sites. (SY)<br>Contributors to WebSights are Sue Yeap (SY) and David Watts (DW)<br></font></p>
