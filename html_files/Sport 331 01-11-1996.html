            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FROM North America, where else, comes a real eye-catcher. It is called Buy Nothing Day and is scheduled for Friday, November 29 - the day after the citizens of that country eat millions of turkeys and slump in front of the annual Thanksgiving Day gridiron match.<br>People of the industrialised nations, and that includes Australians, are being asked to buy absolutely nothing for 24 hours. Buy Nothing Day is an attempt to draw attention to what many groups and individuals believe is the world's main environmental problem: overconsumption by the affluent.<br>It is the brainchild of a Canadian, Vancouver artist-activist Ted Dave. He started it, according to an e-mail I received from a friend this week, as a ?gesture of protest for those of us who feel as if our lives and dreams have been marketed back to us?.<br>The idea has spread - from Canada to its neighbours in the US, then Ireland and England, and recently the Netherlands and other European countries.<br>The e-mail publicity goes on: ?Why don't you join us? Discover the joys of buying less and living more simply, with less environmental damage, less stress, more happiness and personal fulfilment.?<br>Sounds good and it's free, though I am not sure what shopkeepers and other purveyors of the good life might think.<br>???<br>ELECTION fever is closing in. Next Tuesday Americans choose between a man who didn't inhale and a man who wants to go back to the 1950s. One will become leader of the free world.<br>Our Premier Richard Court is making poll noises, as is Opposition Leader Geoff Gallop. Dr Gallop: Debate me. Mr Court: No.<br>In England, that nice John Major is just months away from shuffling off the cares of the prime ministership and handing them to that also-nice Tony Blair.<br>But the real running - again - is being made by the Monster Raving Loony Party. Started 33 years ago by former pop singer Screaming Lord Sutch, the Loonies are now an almost acceptable part of the rich tapestry of British political life.<br>Among the Loonies' election pledges are:<br>?Britain will be towed 800km south so it will enjoy a better climate.<br>?Dogs will have to eat phosphorescent food so people can avoid treading in their messes at night.<br>?Income tax will become part of the national lottery funds so everyone will have a chance to win their money back.<br>?No one will have to work before lunchtime (which may not affect as many as the Loonies think).<br>?Sex and rock'n'roll will be available free from the National Health Service.<br>???<br>BLEEDING OBVIOUS DEPARTMENT: On ABC radio news recently was this: ?It's official - men with pot bellies are lesser sexual athletes than their svelte brethren.<br>?Dr Gary Egger, of Gutbusters, says studies suggest high levels of fat lead to a decrease in testosterone, impairing sexual performance, and meaning men with guts are less virile and fertile.?<br>You could have knocked me over with a feather ... if it wasn't for the gut.<br>???<br>TRIVIA TIME: Some more essential knowledge from the Deb and Jennifer Totally Useless Page on the Internet:<br>?The book of Esther in the Bible is the only book which does not mention the name of God.<br>?Dracula is the most filmed story of all time, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is second and Oliver Twist is third.<br>?Barbie's measurements if she were life size: 39-23-33.<br>?The hyoid bone, in your throat, is the only bone in the body not attached to another bone.<br>?Kiwis (the birds, not the people) lay the biggest eggs with respect to their body size.<br>?Dr Samuel A. Mudd was the physician who set the leg of Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth, hence the expression for ignominy: ?His name is Mudd.?<br></font></p>
