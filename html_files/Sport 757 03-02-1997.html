            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE tyranny of distance has meant that Australian track and field athletes have often competed in isolation, seldom experiencing the tough competition of the busy European and American circuits.<br>But this is slowly changing with Government funding and the development of intensive training through the Australian Institute of Sport.<br>By the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia is expected to have several genuine medal chances.<br>Track and field competition is about as old as mankind itself. Running, jumping and throwing are basics of survival and are prominent throughout history.<br>At the first Ancient Olympic Games in 776BC, and then until 724BC, the only event held was the stadium-length foot race or ?stade?. The earliest recorded winner at the Olympics was Coroebus of Elis who won the 776BC stade race.<br>Track and field events have been contested in all modern Olympics, which began in 1896, and provide the backbone of the Games. Women were not allowed to take part until 1928.<br>The Olympic Games track events consist of races run over distances of from 100m to 10,000m - 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 5000m and 10,000m. There are also four Olympic relay events, the men's and women's 4x100m and 4x400m. Races less than 400m are run wholly within marked lanes; in events longer than 400m, competitors may move to the inside lane after completing the first 400m.<br>Other events on the track are the steeplechase and the hurdles. The steeplechase is an event run over 3000m consisting of 28 hurdle jumps and seven water jumps. Olympic hurdling events are held over 110m and 400m for men and 100m and 400m for women. There are two types of event on the road, the marathon and the walking events.<br>The marathon course is 42.195km, the distance, according to legend, run by Pheidippides in 490BC to seek assistance when the Persians invaded Greece. He ran from the plains of Marathon to the city of Athens.<br>The events most commonly included in international competitions are the 20km and 50km road walks for men, and the 10km road walk for women. The throwing events include the javelin, shot put, discus and hammer.<br>There are four jumping events, the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. And there are two Olympic combined events - the Decathlon for men and the Heptathlon for women. The Decathlon consists of 10 events over two days - 100m, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400m, 110m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500m. The Heptathlon consists of seven events over two days - 100m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200m, long jump, javelin and 800m. Points in both are awarded for specific times, heights and distances, and the winner is the competitor with the most points.<br>OLYMPIC MEDALS<br>AUSTRALIANS have won 59 Olympic medals since 1896: 18 gold, 19 silver and 22 bronze. Women have won 33 medals and men 26.<br>The golden Australians<br>Women<br>Marjorie Jackson: 100m and 200m, Helsinki 1952.<br>Shirley Strickland, 80m hurdles, Helsinki 1952.<br>Betty Cuthbert, 100m and 200m, Melbourne 1956.<br>Betty Cuthbert, Norma Croker, Fleur Mellor and Shirley Strickland, 4x100m relay, Melbourne 1956.<br>Shirley Strickland, 80m hurdles, Melbourne 1956.<br>Betty Cuthbert, 400m, Tokyo 1964.<br>Maureen Caird, 80m hurdles, Mexico 1968.<br>Glynis Nunn, Heptathlon, Los Angeles 1984.<br>Debbie Flintoff-King, 400m hurdles, Seoul 1988.<br>In 1996 at Atlanta, Cathy Freeman won the 400m silver, and Louise McPaul won the javelin silver.<br>Men<br>Edwin Flack, 800m and 1500m, Athens 1896.<br>S.
