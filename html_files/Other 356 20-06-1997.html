            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE gorgeous symbol of our State, Elle Macpherson, wants a family. Many blokes I know would be prepared to help her. However, I suspect their interest stops at a vital point.<br>They're quite happy to practise with Elle at making a family. When it comes to the big step into fatherhood, even with the body beautiful, it is probably too daunting.<br>Fatherhood is not easy. Dads have a lot to do:<br>lThey have to organise the kiddies to help mum with the washing-up.<br>lThey have to tell the lawnmower man where he can lower the blades and which weeds to leave.<br>lThey are responsible for pulling mice out of traps.<br>lThey have to ensure their stubbies are well organised in the fridge so some room is left for trifles like food.<br>lThey have to organise the rest of the family's viewing habits so they don't intrude on the footy, cricket and/or Wimbledon (it's an exhausting time of the year).<br>All this can seem such awesome responsibility. The fact that men do not, as a rule, seek the company of other men to unburden themselves over a cappuccino and focaccia, also means most are incapable of explaining just how hard fatherhood, and even manhood, is.<br>To complicate matters, women are demanding more of a say in the running of the world. Chaps often feel they get a pretty fair say as it is, but let's be reasonable, that is often only in matters concerning the running of the household.<br>Men run the greater world and this is where women are demanding the say.<br>MY FEELING is they can have an equal say when they can deliver a shirt front like John Worsfold. However, this has not gone over well with a number of GYMs (gorgeous young mums) who have been on the receiving end of my wisdom. In fact they looked like they wanted to deliver a Woosha shirt front there and then.<br>Recently I heard a new suggestion to promote equality of the sexes. It was both novel and revolutionary, and made by a man of good character who shall remain nameless.<br>He opined that true equality of the sexes could not be achieved until toilet seats in all mixed households were left at a 45-degree angle.<br>Men could not complain when answering a call of nature that the toilet seat was always down. Conversely, women could not yell that the toilet seat was always up when they went for a quiet sit.<br>One huge snag in this otherwise inspired suggestion was that the toilet seat was actually fixed in that position, ie, it was a permanent fixture.<br>This presents a few practical problems. Men would be better off because they can at least aim for the bowl, choosing to go either over or under the 45-degree seat. It would present a sharp-shooting challenge that most blokes could not refuse.<br>The problems would come at the end of the loo session when the forces of nature weakened to a quiet trickle . . . especially for those who had chosen to go over the top.<br>Women would have a bigger challenge. They would have to balance precariously at an angle, praying that all those diets were working.<br>Men would suffer the same fate once or twice a day but it would stop them reading the paper to get out of the domestic chores.<br>Somehow I think it's back to the drawing board.<br>NOW for a wee joke (no it's not the same subject as before). To ward off the lawyers, let me stress that this is a figment of imagination. It never happened . . . OK.<br>Our smiley Federal Treasurer Peter Costello was at a cocktail party for a group of stockbrokers. In typical politician fashion, he cornered a senior executive to brag about his economic programs.<br>Mr Costello: You know, Bruce, the economy is looking so good. If I weren't Treasurer I'd buy some shares.<br>Bruce: You know, Peter, I agree with you. If you weren't Treasurer I'd buy some, too.<br></font></p>
