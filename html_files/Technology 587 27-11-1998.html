            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">REMARKABLE pieces of information exist on the World Wide Web. Last year a correspondent tracked down the 27 fundamental doctrines of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, for example.<br>And this year I found a fan site dedicated to Bob Lind, an American famous for one song, The Bright, Elusive Butterfly (of Love).<br>It is a marvellous medium to hold such obscure things. But it does not always deliver.<br>One person who I assumed would have burnt his way into the consciousness of Internet users is Richie Benaud.<br>The dry and much-imitated former Australian cricket captain and the greatly admired TV and radio commentator should have had oodles of pages in his honour, I thought.<br>That distinctive voice, those deadpan observations, the encyclopaedic knowledge of the game . . . they are all the stuff of legend and prime material for Web worship by fans.<br>But I can find only one adoration site for Benaud. It is called My Way - the Richie Benaud Fanpage and is part of an amusing Australian site called Hammo's Ultimate Beer and Cricket.<br>Hammo also has a page dedicated to Justin Langer and the raw deal he used to get from the Australian selectors. It hasn't been updated for a year, thus missing the WA left-hander's triumphs this season.<br>The Benaud page is also a bit long in the tooth but contains mostly material that is timeless, such as famous quotes and career highlights.<br>Actually, Hammo appears to be crying out for fellow Netizens to help him build a bigger and better shrine to Benaud. There are places at the page where people can e-mail their favourite quotes and anecdotes, thus joining a sort of Benaud appreciation co-operative.<br>The lack of Benaud sites is a bit galling when you find that an arguably lesser - though very colourful - commentator like Henry Blofeld has a professional site to showcase his love of the game.<br>Henry Blofeld's Official Cricket Website uses attractive frames and bright images to highlight articles by Blofeld on the current Ashes series and his views on the international scene and domestic English competition.<br>Blofeld fans will hardly be surprised to learn that the welcome page has a letter which starts ?My Dear Old Thing?.<br>Three of Benaud's successors as captain have as much or more Web presence<br>than he .<br>The Bill Lawry and Allan Border pages are simple and at times humorous efforts whereas the Greg Chappell World site is extremely professional, covering everything from the elegant batsman's Test career to his latest foray into selling health goods (which you can buy at the site, naturally). Don Bradman is everywhere on the Web - as he should be - and there is even an online petition calling for the great man's recall to the Test side for long enough to finish with a career average of 100 (instead of the famous 99.94).<br>You can find David Boon, the Waugh twins and even a site for those noisy English fans, the Barmy Army.<br>But Hammo's herculean efforts aside, there is not enough Benaud.<br>Links:<br>Hammo's Richie Benaud Fanpage: www.geocities.com/Vienna/4076/benaud.html<br>Henry Blofeld's Official Cricket Website: www.blowers.co.uk<br>Greg Chappell World: www.<br>greg-chappell.com.au/home.htm<br>Links to dozens of players and other sites: www.ashestoashes.com.au/links.html<br>Bring Back the Don petition: www.unisa.edu.au/sleep/thedon/thedon.html<br></font></p>
