            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BRISBANE coach John Northey took full responsibility for his side's lamentable loss to Adelaide at home on Saturday night. He made no excuses.<br>Could we be as honest as Northey, or are there really excuses for any of the following events in the sporting world over the past week?<br>?Channel 9 for not showing the first state of origin rugby league battle until 12.30am on Saturday; an hour when lovers of the game were probably too tired or emotional, or both, to follow the action.<br>The game, won 24-23 by Queensland in the last 40 seconds, was rated by commentators as one of the best for years.<br>?Fremantle supporters for reaching for sedatives whenever Scott Chisholm took the ball in the last quarter of the exciting win over St Kilda at the WACA Ground on Friday night.<br>Chisholm shone, despite the near heart attacks and his sure work on the goal line almost certainly held off a Saints resurgence.<br>?Channel 7 for replaying at least five times - in slow motion from every possible angle - Stewart Loewe's freak accident in the same game.<br>?Tim Watson for identifying Dockers match-winner Matthew Burton as ?Spider Everitt?.<br>?Ian Robertson for mangling the language and saying ?the bounce is not advantaging? either Fremantle or St Kilda.<br>?Fremantle's Clive Waterhouse for a mongrel punt from a set shot that missed everything and offended even mongrels.<br>?Dennis Cometti for saying late in the first quarter of the windy Geelong-West Coast match on Saturday: ?The Eagles by a point (3-2) which is a handy lead in the context of this game.?<br>?Geelong fans for failing to recognise John Worsfold's 200th game. The crowd, starved of action other than rugby-style rolling mauls, opted to get on the ground for a kick rather than allow Worsfold to be chaired off in style after the gritty 21-point Eagles win.<br>Of course they may have just wanted to escape the gale-battered stands for fear of flying signs.<br>?Jason Dunstall, James Hird, Doug Hawkins and Paul Couch for being so obviously nervous on the first night of the disappointing Live and Kicking.<br>?Kylie Minogue for missing all the celebrity heads when she kicked - surprisingly well - in high heels and a dress so skimpy it appeared to put Hawkins in a dreadful sweat on the same show.<br>?Viewers who admitted they turned over to Ten's The Panel (where guests actually watched Live and Kicking while waiting to go on).<br>?Those who say give the show a chance, Couch might say something, Hird may stop interrupting, Hawkins might halve the giggling and Dunstall might stop talking about hairdos (funny subject for a bunch of footy blokes to discuss).<br>?Sam Newman of Nine's Footy Show for calling Seven's effort Bruised and Bleeding.<br>?The Footy Show for turning in one of its best efforts this year - despite a noticeable increase in smut, particularly in Street Talk - and being a lot more faithful to football than the wannabee singers and dancers at Seven.<br></font></p>
