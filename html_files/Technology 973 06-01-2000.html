            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HERE'S a late entry for understatement of the year - the Web is changing even as we speak.<br>If you look at the most popular Australian sites presented by the Where Did We Go survey, Australians are using the Web to do more online share trading, banking and shopping.<br>Four of the top 10 sites visited, including number one Comsec, are oriented to e-commerce.<br>Australian Bureau of Statistics figures last week also told of an increase in online shopping with 652,000 of us doing some buying over the Web during the year.<br>But e-commerce sites have not been the ones to impress when selecting the weekly column of Web Sights for this section.<br>In more than two years of surfing and trying to present a broad range of interests, Web Sights must conclude that the best things the Web offers are still the ingredients it has revolutionised - information and communication.<br>Here is a list of some of the better sites Web Sights has looked at during 1999. It is not a cool or hot list, nor does it pretend to be a definitive best-of - the Web is far too big a place for that sort of claim.<br>But these are all worth looking at for the way they allow the millions now connected to broaden their horizons.<br>Britannica Online: www.britannica.com<br>The Rolls-Royce of encyclopedias is free to anyone on the Web. Instead of stabbing and missing with search engines that could unearth misleading information, Britannica goes straight to the source of its own authoritative text as well as offering dozens of alternative ways through other sites.<br>SETI@home: setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu<br>If there is intelligent alien life out there, this project could discover it simply by harnessing the idle time of millions of computers connected to the Net.<br>More than 1.5 million people in 224 countries have downloaded the SETI@home screensaver and have contributed 125,000 years of computer time.<br>The screensaver program links to Seti radio telescopes tracking the heavens for signs of life.<br>Newseum - stories of the century: www.newseum.org/century/index.htm<br>The Newseum project may be a little pro-American, but it has helped millions of Web surfers concentrate their minds on what have been the truly important events of the century.<br>Journalists had first bite when they presented their list of the top 100 stories earlier in the year.<br>Users have been able to take part and supply plenty of feedback since then. Their list was due to go up on Boxing Day.<br>Google: www.google.com<br>As the Web grows, search engines are finding it hard to keep up the indexing needed to find relevant matches for queries.<br>Many, such as Yahoo, Excite and AltaVista, have developed into portal sites which now offer hundreds of ways to try to get to information and join the online shopping trend.<br>Google bucks that trend by offering straight and very fast searching without the distractions.<br>Baggygreen: www.baggygreen.com.au<br>It may be heavily tied in with Channel 9's cricket telecasts and the Australian Cricket Board's PR machine, but this branch of CricInfo offers everything the online fan desires - live scores from around the world, news, competitions and thousands of bewitching statistics. Most importantly, it is a no-nonsense, unflashy site rich in information.<br>Rottnest: www.rottnest.wa.gov.au<br>We are cheating a little here because this site was launched in late 1998.<br>However, it deserves high praise for the way it bundles Rottnest so comprehensively and delivers it to the world.<br>Highlight is the virtual bike ride that gives Web surfers a "ride' around the island, with the chance to visit 14 stops.<br>First Nine Months: www.pregnancycalendar.com/first9months/<br>A stunning visual use of the Web to tell the story of pregnancy, its only downside is the computer power needed to render it quickly.<br>American multi-media worker Joseph Moore was so thrilled by wife Deanna's pregnancy that he decided to chronicle the event on the Web.<br>The result is a visual treat with accompanying simple text, starting from the moment of conception and ending with the healthy birth of baby Emma.<br>Statmarket: www.statmarket.com<br>A must for those who must know the latest developments in computing and the Net.<br>It has weekly updated figures on browser use, operating systems, popular sites and even screen resolutions so Webmasters and site developers can focus on trends.<br>Also worth a mention in the Web statistics area is Ireland's NUA Internet Surveys at www.nua.ie/surveys/.<br><br></font></p>
