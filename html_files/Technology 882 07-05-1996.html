            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE senseless slaughter of 35 people with high-powered rifles at once serene Port Arthur is dominating debate on the Internet.<br>Gun control is the hot topic in the aus.politics and aus.general newsgroups, which had slumped into torpor after the Federal election.<br>Arguments about whether guns should be banned totally, Australian laws made uniform and even the necessity of control are appearing hourly under a variety of headings.<br>Debate started within hours of the first news of the tragedy on April 29.<br>A correspondent wrote to aus.politics saying that if people had been allowed to carry concealed hand-guns, the killings would never have reached such dreadful proportions because one of the eventual victims could have shot and killed or wounded the gunman.<br>He backed the statement with literature from the US saying gun control ?enslaved the population?.<br>People who replied to the posting were adamant that gun control was necessary, citing figures that showed the US - with weapons freely available in most States - had a murder rate per 100,000 young males aged 15-24 of 37.2, compared with 0.09 in neighbouring Canada, which has strict gun laws.<br>There appears to be no uniform conclusion but some postings are becoming vitriolic with correspondents resorting to name-calling and insults.<br>This a fairly mild example of the vindictiveness of the debate.<br>Pro-gun correspondent: ?This is a discussion? Go to bed, Mark.?<br>Another pro-gunner: ?How old is Mark anyway? I'm beginning to get the impression that he's only 12 or 13. Well, that does seem to be his mental age. Gee I hope he doesn't actually own a gun - now that is a scary thought.?<br>A wide variety of sites on the World Wide Web tackle gun control, although it is hard to find any directly related to Port Arthur.<br>The Ban Guns site is one that was set up in direct response to the massacre and is an online petition to Prime Minister John Howard calling for a complete gun ban.<br>The unnamed creator of the site wrote: ?Politicians are continually attempting to change the topic when it comes to gun laws in order to "keep the peace' with members of the gun lobby. I believe it is about time the real voice of opinion on this matter was heard. I support the movement to BAN guns in Australia. Not register, not licence, but BAN to all except civil defence and law enforcement.?<br>Other Web sites, principally in the US, raise issues for and against, and information from these sites is often quoted in the newsgroup arguments.<br>URLs<br>Ban guns site: www.bluesky.net.au/tis-shop/banguns/<br>Gunfree site: www.gunfree.inter.net<br>Gun Control: www.vicnet.net.au:80/vicnet/gun/gun.html<br>Gun Control Debating Page: www.aloha.net/~frizbee/pagnine.html<br>Myths Of Gun Control: trojan.neta.com/~dodson/myth.html<br></font></p>
