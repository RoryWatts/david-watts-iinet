            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The browser pioneer is trying to head off the Microsoft onslaught.<br>Netscape is trying to arm users in what is becoming a fight for survival on the Web. The Californian company, which surfed to success on the back of its Navigator browser, shocked the computing industry a fortnight ago when it predicted it was facing heavy losses.<br>The fastest-growing computer company in history warned that it would post a $140 million loss for the fourth quarter of 1997.<br>The company is expected to cut many jobs. Some commentators predict it will start giving away its browsers free, like Microsoft, whose Internet Explorer 3.0 and 4.0 browsers have eaten away at Netscape's share of the market.Commercial users have been paying about $60 to license Navigator. Netscape has turned its home page in both Australia and the US into a sort of armoury for the fight against Microsoft. Number one spot on the page is given to detailed instructions on how to uninstall Internet Explorer and make Netscape's Communicator or Navigator the default browser.Long, informative pages are also linked to tell users how to convert MSIE Favourites into Netscape bookmarks, and how to perform the complicated task of changing MS mail and addresses to the Netscape format. MS mail is in a proprietory format that is difficult - but not impossible - to change.Microsoft's steady erosion of Netscape's once seemingly invincible position - it used to have 84 per cent market share - is variously attributed to the fact that MS makes a better browser; it includes it with Windows 95 on new PCs and simply because it is free. Browser surveys all vary in exact results, but the trend since last October's release of MSIE 4.0 has been all Microsoft's way. A rough average of various surveys puts Netscape at 56 per cent and MSIE at nearly 40 and growing.<br>Netscape sees a loyal user base as a strong weapon. Access asked 20 users last week which browser they used and 16 said Netscape. Two of the other four used MSIE 4.0 and the other two used a combination of Netscape and MSIE 3.0 and 4.0. Most of the Netscape users expressed strong feelings about allowing Bill Gates's Microsoft to dominate the Web world as well as the PC world (where Windows is estimated to be the operating system on 80 per cent of computers).<br>Some admitted Netscape had come with their Net software when they signed up with their ISPs.They either saw no reason to change or did not feel technically competent enough to do so.<br>American users, polled by Net giant ZDNet, gave a variety of responses when asked what could be done to help Netscape. ?No matter what desperate marketing manoeuvres Netscape attempts, won't they fail if the underlying products are clearly inferior? I was a loyal Netscape user from its first release - until MS Internet Explorer 3.0, which was a clearly superior browser,? said one.<br>?If victory in the browser wars (or at least a draw) is essential for Netscape's survival, their browser software team holds the key,? he concluded.<br>?Why must the government step in in order for Netscape to survive?? another user asked, citing the US Justice Department's fight to stop Microsoft including Internet Explorer with Win95.<br>?Netscape is suffering because they grew too big too fast. Sounds to me like Netscape is making their own funeral arrangements.?<br>HELPDESK<br>Netscape: www.netscape.com.au, home.netscape.com<br>Uninstall/conversion details: home.netscape.com/download/netscape_now.html<br>Favorites to Bookmarks: home.sprynet.com/sprynet/jae/ieconverter.htm<br>ZDNet Anchordesk feature: www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/story/story_1624.html<br>Tommy's List of Live Cam Worldwide: chili.rt66.com/ozone/cam.htm<br>Colin Manes' site: www.space.net.au/ ~manes/game.html<br></font></p>
