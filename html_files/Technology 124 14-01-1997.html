            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web is a blessing for those of us who love trivia. Never has there been so vast a global dumping ground for useless information.<br>Sites with mountains of trivia are still my favourites 18 months into surfing. And search engines that can take me to them at great speed - such as Alta Vista's Australasian mirror - are welcome friends.<br>My top 10 sites of 1996 contain plenty of pages of trivia and concentrate on my fondness for sport, news, software and movies. The Web is like that; it's up to the individual to find what they like. No one body controls what you find.<br>This top 10 includes several sites that have been round for two years or more, further evidence that you don't have to be new to be good.<br>Internet Movie Data Base: The database began with a casual question to a Usenet newsgroup about who the best looking actress was in films. It has snowballed into a repository of facts and trivia on more than 50,000 films. Cinemagoers all over the world contribute much of the information.<br>There are reviews by established critics and normal Net users, bibliographies, filmographies, lists of film goofs and links to myriads of other film sites.<br>The Baggy Green Web Site: Cricket buffs have never been treated so well. This growing database began with the humble aim of archiving the statistics of everyone who played for Australia.<br>Now it is covering anyone who played a Test for any country. But that is not even the tenth of it. Nearly every other statistic known to cricket is emerging.<br>Alta Vista: This site began last year and developed a reputation as being the fastest search engine available. It kept that in 1996, and the addition of an Australasian mirror site seems to have added speed.<br>Beyond the Black Stump Software: An Australian site which offers plenty of choices for local FTP downloads of popular software.<br>It does not have the enormous quantity of Download.com or TUCOWS, but it offers speed and is updated daily.<br>CIA World Factbook: If you want your facts on any country in the world, go no further.<br>It looks boring and straight, and it is. But this is just as essential a site on the Web as any Java-driven, frame-ridden, graphic maze.<br>Bibliomania: Lots of words, but what words they are. A growing collection of classic novels that can be read easily in HTML is sprouting here.<br>Jesus Home Page: Controversial, but witty and informative site. The unknown creator (of the page) has played straight down the line, setting up fascinating links and graphics in the way he/or she thinks Jesus Christ would have done if He had access to HotDog and FTP.<br>Newslink: I now have bookmarked all the newspapers I need, but dip back in here to see what's new. More than 4000 links allow surfers to start their mornings with the Times or the Washington Post or even the Daily News of Sri Lanka.<br>Bagpipes at the Movies: The most off-the-wall site I've seen all year.<br>Two Canadians have compiled a list of films in which bagpipes are played.<br>Deb and Jen's Land of Useless Facts: The title says it all.<br></font></p>
