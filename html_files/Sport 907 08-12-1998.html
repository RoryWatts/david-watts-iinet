            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT is a great social lubricant. So is beer.<br>A group of us was imbibing one and talking about the other on Saturday night.<br>The only subject possible was golf. The Australian Open had been so good that every male present said his schedule for the next day consisted of one thing only: watching the golf on Channel 7.<br>But who would win? It was such an open contest.<br>?That's why they call it the Australian Open,? suggested one helpful drinker.<br>?I hope it's Greg Chalmers. That would be great for WA,? said another.<br>Several others - all native Sandgropers - murmured agreement over their beer ... which was a Tasmanian brand.<br>A couple said they would like to see Stuart Appleby win after his year of heartbreak.<br>With absolute certainty, I said: ?Nick Faldo, easily. He's the best player out there, so precise, so experienced, more relaxed than he's been.?<br>Which only goes to show I know nothing about golf.<br>Sandy Roberts, who hosted Seven's coverage in a jokey, relaxed way that indicated he loved his golf even more than his football, turned out to be a worse judge than me.<br>During Saturday's coverage he wondered aloud whether a fine last day and a turn of the fates would see Greg Norman - who nearly missed the cut - emerge triumphant.<br>Jack Newton, nearly always affable, turned blunt and said words to the effect of not bloody likely.<br>It was a turning point for Roberts who had been far too Norman-centric until then. He started to focus on Chalmers, Appleby, Faldo and Peter Senior, who despite the openness were far better bets than his over-hyped Shark.<br>Seven would have to be well pleased with this open Open. It set up a showdown for a TV sporting battle between its coverage of the Presidents Cup tournament in Melbourne, and Nine's coverage of the third Ashes Test from the Adelaide Oval.<br>Remote controls will get a workout if the golf is as good as the Open.<br>Without proper coverage of Perth Glory matches it is hard to imagine any summer sport on TV more dramatic or exciting than a good golf tournament.<br>Appleby's chance to force a play-off on Sunday was edge-of-the-seat viewing. The silence on course at Royal Adelaide must have been matched in many livingrooms, as must have the groan of despair (or relief for Chalmers' supporters) when the wretched ball refused to go in.<br>Foxtel viewers had no relief from this type of drama because the unfortunate sods were able to watch the Nick Price-Tiger Woods play-off for $US1million in the Sun City Million Dollar tournament on Sunday night.<br>It was more tense and even better golf arguably, but the commentators - like the Seven boys - still said ?what a wonderful golf shot?.<br>And what other type of shot could it be, I wonder?<br></font></p>
