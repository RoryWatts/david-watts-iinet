            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS should have come to you from somewhere tropical and expensive like the Bahamas or Tahiti. After all, I did exactly the same as Kerry Packer on Melbourne Cup eve; backed Might and Power to win.<br>The difference was I had $2 each way, returning $17, and he had hundreds and thousands - perhaps earning him the nickname Lollies - and won between $3 million and $5 million, forcing at least three bookies to contemplate early retirement.<br>Another difference was I had a trifecta. And if Linesman hadn't pulled up as if hit by a cannonball and if Alfa wasn't still running, I would have made squillions. I'd be rich, rich I tell you. The word mug springs to mind.<br>Picking the Cup trifecta is one of the hardest things in life. Nearly as hard is trying not to look at a TV when it is in the rough field of view.<br>Blokes and children seem to suffer from this affliction, going into a trance no matter what is on the box. Women, or so my wife tells me, do not. They are TOO BUSY.<br>The other day I was even beguiled by someone named Ricki Lake who hosts an American talk show on Channel 7 in which women were openly complaining about what poor love makers their partners were.<br>The poor saps were in a soundproof booth thinking half the population of the world was being told what Lotharios they were. It was cringe-making.<br>That TV has the power to imprison and pacify can be in little doubt. In the past fortnight a row has erupted in Britain because the Government wants to put sets in nearly all prison cells.<br>RITISH prisons have had to cut costs by 13.3 per cent over three years. It has been decided those doing porridge should spend a lot more unsupervised time in their cells. So, a prison service strapped for cash is buying mountains of televisions because it hopes they will have a tranquillising effect.<br>TV then saves the money that would have had to have been spent on other activities if there had been no TV.<br>A prison official called it the ?greatest control mechanism you can think of?.<br>It is not an original idea of course. Nursing homes, mental wards, overworked GYMs (gorgeous young mums) all use TV as a baby or granny-sitter. Years ago when our children were toddling, many GYMs swore their favourite person on Earth was John, the funny guy, on Play School.<br>TV is a very mixed blessing. Even horrible shows like the one hosted by Lake bring comfort to some people. It is part of the furniture, an almost irreplaceable fact of modern life.<br>People of my generation - 40-year-olds - were the first to grow up with it. Our parents did not treat it as a pacifier and babysitter initially, setting rules about when it could be watched, for how long and from what distance (or you'll go blind).<br>These rules were easy to obey because TV often had nothing on until 5pm in the early days.<br>But it is hard to imagine a life without Roy Rogers, the Mousketeers, Texas Rangers, or Felix the Cat. As we got older there was Homicide, Bellbird, GTK, Mission: Impossible and The Avengers. Now we can be entertained by Good News Week, The Simpsons and Melrose Place (heiress to the unforgettable Dynasty and Dallas).<br>But we Australians don't seem to mind a lot of mindless rubbish if ratings figures can be believed.<br>Last month Nielsen ratings said our top 10 consisted of two sitcoms (Friends and Suddenly Susan, both American), our very own Blue Heelers and nearly all the rest were infotainment programs like Better Homes and Gardens, The Great Outdoors and Australia's Funniest Home Video Show.<br>It makes you wonder who is in prison.<br>I'm off to watch Oprah, bye.<br></font></p>
