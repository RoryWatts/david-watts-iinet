            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet is playing a big role in highlighting the brutality in the troubled Asian nation of Burma.<br>The Free Burma site on the World Wide Web, complete with rolling script, offers more than a dozen ways for people from the Western world to try to stop the excesses of the military regime that has ruled dictatorially since 1962 when it overthrew the country's democratically elected government.<br>Burma is now a country under the yokes of slave labour, summary arrest and execution and suppression of free speech.<br>Diminutive Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi struggles to free the nation from her shackled existence under house arrest in the capital Rangoon.<br>The Free Burma site offers concerned and aware Netizens the chance to lobby governments, the UN and multinational investors in Burma, and offers education, through .WAV files and pictures and text, about Burma's plight.<br>?Free Burma is a collection of software, hardware, documentation and volunteers all doing what we're best at to hasten the replacement of the current military government which tortures its citizens, with one chosen by the people who live there,? the hard-hitting introduction to the Web site says.<br>The site has access to newsletters, e-mail discussion groups, newsgroups and direct Net action in the shape of form e-mail letters addressed to movers and shakers in governments and corporations.<br>Progress in the battle for Burma is well documented. Free Burma does not claim the successes are due to it, but the pressure from the global virtual community is starting to tell.<br>?The world is learning about the trouble in Burma. Businesses are refusing to pay torturers. Burma is becoming the South Africa of the 90s,? the progress report says.<br>It lists dozens of initiatives taken by governments and firms to stop collaboration with the dictatorship.<br>URL: http://sunsite.unc.edu/freeburma/<br>???<br>ISRAEL is now led by Benjamin Netanyahu, a man who some political observers fear may not embrace a feeling for Middle East peace as strongly as his predecessors, Shimon Peres and the assassinated Yitzhak Rabin.<br>Some insight into the Likud leader can be obtained at Mr Netanyahu's Web page which features speeches, interviews and an address on economics. The page is online at Likud's Web site.<br>URL: http://usa.likud.org.il/chairman<br></font></p>
