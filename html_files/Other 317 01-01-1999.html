            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE ALL need role models and examples. Today I want to lean on State Environment Minister Cheryl Edwardes.<br>On Christmas Eve she was interviewed by ABC television news about development at Cockburn Sound. In the space of one minute, she used two words I have not heard before, or certainly not the way she used them.<br>Mrs Edwardes told reporter Tom Baddeley that action would be taken to remediate the water. Shortly after, she said action would also be taken to beneficiate something else.<br>The details were submerged by her startling use of English . . . as she is spoke by politicians.<br>Though she used remediate as a verb, it is defined by Webster's Dictionary as an archaic adjective (the modern preference is remedial).<br>Her use of beneficiate was on the way to being right. Webster's says it means: ?The treatment of raw material (as iron ore) to improve physical or chemical properties, especially in preparation for smelting.?<br>I must admit it is the first time I have heard it. Mrs Edwardes' use of it instead of ?benefit? surely proves that politicians prefer to keep away from words that may come back to haunt them, for which read plain English.<br>So in that spirit I have decided to use the word gruntled.<br>Once I heard Mrs Edwardes say remediate and beneficiate, I thought why not? First I had to find out whether it was a real word because the only time I've seen it referred to is in jokes along the lines of ?if someone can be disgruntled when they are unhappy, why can't they be gruntled when they're happy??<br>Well they can be, it turns out. Again my source is Webster's, which defines ?gruntle? as a transitive verb that came into being in 1926 as a ?back-formation from disgruntle? and means ?to put in a good humour?.<br>So, it is quite correct to say: ?The guests were gruntled with a good meal and good conversation.?<br>Now I've rabbited on for half a column to get to my point, which is, I'm feeling very gruntled at the start of 1999.<br>The reason I am gruntled is because in late 1998, a GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) asked me, and a few other blokes, to join her book club.<br>Rather than having a group of chardonnay-sipping natterers come to grips with literature, she wants a mixed book club with a bit of oomph and humour that the blokes will no doubt provide.<br>Perhaps she wants more variety in the drinks and catering too. After all a slab of beer and a few party pies will no doubt spice up the current girlie mixture of white wine and low-fat, lettuce-based sandwiches.<br>There are possible complications, however.<br>Shortly after the GYM asked if I wanted to join the book club, I sought the advice of another bloke she had also invited.<br>We decided to put forward a list of books we would like to see read by club members.<br>The list begins, as it should, with the classics: the Ampol Sporting Book of Records, Jack Pollard's Australian Tennis, The Coach (a profile of Ron Barassi) and Spin Me a Spinner (a personal analysis of the 1962-63 Ashes series by Richie Benaud).<br>We presented this first part of the list to the GYM, telling her we had yet to decide between Johnny Raper's Rugby League Book and My Country's Keeper by Wally Grout.<br>She went ashen and walked away and we have not heard from her since about the starting date for the book club.<br>But I'm sure that's because she may have been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and depth of choice.<br>Couldn't be any other reason . . . could it?<br></font></p>
