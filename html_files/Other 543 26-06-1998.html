            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT do we really know about Australian tennis champion Pat Rafter? His Wimbledon biography tells us he is 185cm tall, weighs 79.5kg and has won more than $US4.83 million (or about 8.5 squillion in Australian money at current exchange rates).<br>His fan page on the Internet reveals he was born in Mount Isa, Queensland, one of a family of nine children, loves chocolate, his favourite film is Jerry Maguire and he thinks the Simpsons is great.<br>Overall, he comes across as a good-looking, mild-mannered, almost old-fashioned gentleman. But I have reason to believe he is in league with the devil ? or Rupert Murdoch at the very least.<br>You see my GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) of a wife adores Patrick, has near heart attacks when his mind wanders off during a match (which is so often that I am considering employing a personal GP for her during Grand Slam tournaments) and talks non-stop about him when I try to do something useful like watch Peter Matera return to god-like status on the footy field.<br>She has become a sports nut, a couch potato. And Pat Rafter is to blame. Now he is costing us money.<br>It is Wimbledon time, season of knickers, sweat and Trabes and ?Furry? Fred on Channel 9. Only trouble is that Nine does not show Wimbledon until 11 at night on a two-hour delay. Something to do with networking; but it means we in Perth get to watch rain delays two hours after they have happened and even when the sun has actually come out.<br>This year, that is not good enough for my wife. She has signed us up with the Murdoch-Telstra Beelzebub of Foxtel, which shows Wimbledon live from 9pm to 4am after two hours of the previous day's highlights.<br>Patrick - who appears to be going well - is the main reason we now have a little black box on the TV and a couple of children salivating at the prospect of watching six hours of the Simpsons every weekend.<br>Some months ago I tested my GYM on whether Foxtel would be an improvement around our happy home. Here is how the conversation went then:<br>ME: Darling, what do you think about getting Foxtel? It's got the Discovery Channel and new movies and the BBC world news. Educational, informative and entertaining.<br>GYM: Preposterous. All you want it for is rude movies and sport. No way chum, now get outside and do something useful.<br>ME: Yes dear.<br>Compare this with the Patrick-induced conversation we had just last week:<br>GYM: Wimbledon's live on Foxtel and that means I can watch Patrick. So we're getting it, okay.<br>ME: Yes dear.<br>Notice the subtle difference between the two conversations. Young blokes intending marriage should take note that this is the only way to deal with women ? be firm.<br>And so we have Foxtel and have paid dollars to the Make Rupert Murdoch An Even Richer Man Foundation. At the moment no one is allowed in front of it between the hours of 7pm and 4am in case they obstruct my wife's view of the tennis and a possible glimpse of Patrick.<br>She doesn't even listen to my sparkling repartee at the dinner table any more. I used to keep her informed on the progress of Chris Mainwaring's knee, and Shane Warne's shoulder, and the pros and cons of flooding the backline, the efficacy of the torpedo and the obvious eastern States conspiracies against Justin Langer and the Dockers.<br>But she doesn't care. All we hear is Patrick this and Patrick that. Hopefully I'll get a chance to watch Foxtel soon. It's amazing the progress modern technology can bring to our lives.<br>First off I want to watch Bonanza, then the Munsters, then I Dream of Jeannie, then ?<br></font></p>
