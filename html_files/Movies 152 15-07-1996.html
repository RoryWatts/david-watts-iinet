            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Hackers (M)<br>Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Fisher Stevens<br>Directed by Iain Softley<br>* *<br>HACKERS is almost a good film. The plot is almost good, the acting is almost good, and so are the computer special effects.<br>But when you strip away the lashings of style heaped on by director Iain Softley, what is left is not much more than an agreeable B grade flick.<br>Hackers hypes itself as a film about the new youth sub-culture of street-smart, techno-literate teens capable of ruling the world through computer hacking - dialling in to major corporation data bases and causing havoc.<br>All the film really is though is an excuse to have a love story-cum-crime caper dressed up in new 90s clothes.<br>The likeable romantic leads in Hackers are Briton Jonny Lee Miller and Jon Voight's daughter Angelina Jolie. Miller is doing the rounds of Perth's cinemas at the moment as Sick Boy in Trainspotting where he has an Edinburgh brogue you could cut with a knife.<br>In Hackers, Miller, a sensitive and photogenic actor, has developed a mid-Atlantic accent to handle the character of Dade Murphy, aka Crash Override (his hacking ?handle?). Dade hacked 1507 Wall Street systems when he was only 11, causing financial chaos. His sentence was to stay off computers until his 18th birthday, which is where the film finds him.<br>He can't keep away from hacking though and has a technologically impossible but cinematically crafty tussle with another hacker to take over the programming of a TV station.<br>The other hacker turns out to be Jolie's sexy androgynous character Kate, a tough babe beating the dudes in a predominantly male pastime.<br>The cliches gather. It is hate at first sight as Dade and Kate battle to show who is the coolest hacker. Dade wants to win because he yearns to see Kate in a dress and to go out with her. But this new brand of confident 90s woman ?doesn't do dates?.<br>So the pair engage in a comic battle to see whose hacking can cause the most inconvenience to an inept secret service officer charged with bringing hackers to justice.<br>They enter his name on a pornography database, eliciting calls from all sorts of sickos, they invade his police records and have him marched off to jail, and finally Dade hacks the cop's tax records, applying the coup de grace by telling the system the law officer is dead.<br>This is all a rather amusing sideshow to the film's main action which has a veteran hacker - Fisher Stevens as The Plague - scheming to steal $25 million from the mega oil corporation he works for as chief security officer.<br>Plague inserts a virus into his company's software then tries to frame Dade and Kate's young hackers.<br>This is where style really overtakes content, probably to mask the cliche-ridden plot.<br>Plague has long, greasy hair and skateboards around his office - like all the hackers. All the kids are in outrageous fashions which could become de rigeur on the streets if Hackers catches on.<br>But as the plot thickens you really do get the feeling you've seen it all before. There are no surprises as the kids take on the giants of the oil corporation and the secret service to prove their innocence.<br>And there are no surprises as Kate and Dade relentlessly move from hate to love. There is an attempt at magical moments as the love story grows. The magic almost comes off but the cliches that preceded it spoil the moment.<br>Computers form a central part of this film, though they are director Softley's window dressing for his tired story. Best then not to take the computers too seriously. A warning to the impressionable - computers don't and can't do what these little laptops do.<br>So the viewer has to suspend belief and see all the computer scenes - and there are many - for what they are: cinematic artifice to lend lustre.<br></font></p>
