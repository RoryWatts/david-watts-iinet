            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Federal Government has slammed the door shut on Telstra's plans to introduce timed local calls for business, and possibly force home Internet users to pay more for services.<br>Communications Minister Richard Alston moved last week to dampen a growing public outcry against Telstra introducing timed local calls.<br>In a letter dated February 12 Senator Alston said the Government would move to ?significantly enhance? the right to untimed local voice and data calls for residential users. But it has side-stepped the important issue of Telstra time-charging Internet service providers for modem calls that they receive.<br>The letter says: ?Residential customers have been given the legislated right to untimed local calls for non-voice (facsimile and data) as well as voice calls. The extension to business of the legislated right for untimed local voice calls in the Telstra Act has been retained.?<br>But a spokesman for the Minister refused to rule out the scenario where Telstra could time-charge ISPs for receiving modem calls, thus being forced to onpass these costs to the subscriber. This would break the spirit of the Government's commitment, but not its letter.<br>The spokesman referred to the situation whereby the calling party was charged as ?convention? but admitted that a receiving party may be held liable for call costs as is the case in 1-800 calls. But he said the possibility was ?remote?.<br>?Our policy is clear,? Senator Alston said yesterday. ?Residential customers will have a legislative guarantee of untimed local data calls. The fact that some Telstra executive tells a Senate committee that his wish list includes being able to charge Internet service providers on a timed basis for incoming data calls is quite irrelevant.<br>?What matters is our policy.?<br>Two weeks ago Telstra executives told the Senate committee reviewing the Government's legislation for full and open competition in the telecommunications sector from July 1 that timed local calls were needed to deal with peak time congestion caused by people using the Net.<br>Senator Alston wrote to the committee saying the Government would not be swayed by Telstra complaints.<br>He reaffirmed the Government's policy to guarantee untimed local calls to households for both normal telephone services and for non-voice services like fax and the Net.<br>But he did not give businesses the same guarantee on local timed calls for data. The potential for business to pass on increased Telstra costs caused the recent outcry.<br>Perth Net users' advocate Kimberley Heitman said that the Senate committee's fax machines were busy all Tuesday, and Net users mobilised quickly.<br>?This is the fourth such attempt by Telstra, and each time the reaction from the Net has been faster and more strident,? he said.<br>Telstra proposed to the Senate committee that calls be charged on a time basis to the recipient. In the case of Internet services, this would have meant Internet access providers paying timed local calls for connections from their thousands of customers who must ring an IAP to access the Net.<br>Because of growing use of the Net, IAPs' costs would increase and many would be forced to pass them back to the residential user or fold.<br>Critics of Telstra's timed calls move such as freelance communications writer Stewart Fist say that Telstra's argument that increased Net use is clogging public voice networks is false. He has cited research in the US in which several telephone companies found this not to be the case.<br>In fact, Mr Fist says Telstra is benefiting by increased Net use with householders often opting to pay for a second phone line devoted to data, freeing their first line for voice only.<br>He contends that Telstra is seeking a major share of the IAP market and local timed calls would force the now traditional small service operators to close, leaving the market open to Telstra's Big Pond Net provider.<br>The possibility of local timed calls prompted hundreds of user submissions to the Senate committee in a short time.<br>Michael Malone, information services manager for iiNet Technologies, Perth's biggest IAP, wrote an eloquent and impassioned submission summing up many Net users and IAP's disquiet.<br>?Enforced time charging will destroy our future,? he wrote.?Not just that of iiNet, but it will choke the potential that this global network has for your children, for small businesses and for those people not lucky enough to be able to afford to pay more for their access. We urge the Senate to consider the social, educational, economic and anti-competitive implications of Telstra's move. Put aside the statistics and the arguments of congestion, and consider what the Internet will provide for your children: a globally competitive education, cross-cultural communication, opportunities, and jobs.?<br>Mr Heitman, a spokesman for peak Australian Net users' group Electronic Frontiers Australia and the WA Internet Association, said that Telstra had been rebuffed before.?(But) it has not hesitated to distort the truth for the sake of a grab for greater profit,? he said.<br>Telstra wanted a percentage of every usage of the Internet, and wanted to reduce congestion without capital expenditure.<br>Repeated e-mails and faxes to Senator Alston's office since Saturday night had not been answered by yesterday morning.<br>URLs<br>THE prospect of timed local calls affecting Net users has been the catalyst for strong opinions on the World Wide Web.<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia - a leading fighter against such charges - has been urging users to become informed about Telstra's policies and to join the lobby against a feared Telstra attempt to dominate Net access.<br>Telstra domination and charged calls are particularly pertinent in WA where many users enjoy relatively cheap, often flat-rate, access compared with Eastern States householders.<br>URLs<br>EFA Stop Telstra Campaign - www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/telstra.html<br>Tel$tra - Death of Internet - hal9000.net.au/~action/<br>Tel$tra - Timed Data Calls - wwwcs.newcastle.edu.au/CSS/telstra.html<br>Stewart Fist (communications specialist) - ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/stewart-fist/<br>WA Internet Association - www.waia.asn.au<br>Telstra - www.telstra.com.au<br>Department of Communications and the Arts - www.dca.gov.au<br>E-mail to Senator Alston's office - minister@dca.gov.au<br>-- David Watts (watto@iinet.net.au)<br></font></p>
