            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SINGAPORE'S politicians have been trying to put a calmer, more tolerant face on Internet censorship.<br>Six of the seven MPs who spoke about the information highway in a debate on the Information and Arts Ministry's budget warned against over-regulating, overkill and shooting at moving targets.<br>They agreed that Government measures taken to curb abuse were necessary because it was important to sift out objectionable content.<br>A few suggested measures such as parental guidance, public education, tough abuse laws and filtering software.<br>But Peh Chin Hua, the member for Jalan Besar, hit out strongly against cyberspace abuse and said the Government should act against those who used the Internet to spread slanderous rumours, peddle offensive material and commit economic crimes.<br>There were advantages to the Net but he stressed that the Government should be vigilant against abuse.<br>A report in the Straits Times last Friday said that MP Kanwaljit Soin asked how the Government intended to tackle problems arising from the exponential growth of digital communication and whether individuals with their own World Wide Web pages would be affected by any Government measures to stem abuse.<br>Chew Heng Ching, chairman of the government parliamentary committee for information and the arts, acknowledged the Net was a powerful communication tool that had experienced exponential growth. He opposed impeding its growth.<br>The Internet was in line with the IT2000 masterplan, or Singapore's blueprint for an intelligent island, and in line with its objective to exploit information technology.<br>?Over-regulation would jeopardise our efforts to promote Singapore as a regional media centre,? Mr Chew said.<br>Dr Wang Kai Yuen pointed out that any legislation introduced to guard against abuse on the Net would be a two-edged sword, and cautioned that it might discourage foreign service providers from going to the country.<br></font></p>
