            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE ALL make miskates. It is said doctors bury theirs. Airlines probably crash theirs. And the good people of the Federal electorate of Oxley appear to have elected theirs.<br>In recent weeks I have made a few blues which I would like to put right. For a start, in another area of the newspaper, I said Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs sang It Ain't Necessarily So. Well it wasn't necessarily so. That throaty number was the work of Normie Rowe.<br>Still on singers, I named Bob Seger as a must muso for blokes. Actually I called him Bob Seeger; confusing the spelling of his last name with that of the grand old American folkster Pete Seeger (of Little Boxes fame).<br>In the same column where I named the wrong Seger (at least it wasn't Sega), I said the great John Wayne movie was The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence. Well, no. It was Liberty Valance. Valence is a chemical term if my memory serves, and going on the above evidence it is better not to resort to that.<br>Please forgive the sloppiness. I guess none of the errors is up to the level of a king of England who, according to Spike Milligan, said on his death bed: ?I feel better now.?<br>Milligan, who seems to love errors, often introduced himself in print as Spine Milligna, the famous misprimpt.<br>And I think it was he who claimed a battlefield general when confronted with an opposing army's new cannon, had this to say: ?They'll never hit anything from th . . .? (thud).<br>Mistakes help the world go round. Sometimes we learn from them, sometimes others profit from them. My favourite this year was the Englishman who mistook a tube of Superglue for his pile cream . . . and stuck his buttocks together.<br>THERE have been a few other howlers too. These were sent by a correspondent to an Internet mailing list of which I am a member:<br>A company trying to continue its five-year perfect safety record showed its workers a film aimed at encouraging the use of safety goggles on the job. According to Industrial Machinery News, the film's depiction of gory industrial accidents was so graphic that 25 workers suffered minor injuries in their rush to leave the screening room. Thirteen others fainted, and one man required seven stitches after he cut his head falling off a chair while watching the film.<br>The Chico, California, City Council enacted a ban on nuclear weapons, setting a $500 fine for anyone detonating one within city limits. (Let that be a warning to tyrants.)<br>A convict broke out of jail in Washington DC, then a few days later accompanied his girlfriend to her trial for robbery. At lunch, he went out for a sandwich. She needed to see him, so had him paged. Police officers recognised his name and arrested him as he returned to the courthouse in a car he had stolen over the lunch hour.<br>And my mate Kevin in Washington DC sent me these car accident insurance claims recently:<br>Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have.<br>I thought my window was down, but I found it was up when I put my head through it.<br>The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.<br>I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and headed over the embankment.<br>The pedestrian had no idea which way to run as I ran over him.<br>I saw a slow-moving, sad-faced old gentleman as he bounced off the roof of my car.<br>That's enough of that. Next week we'll examine things to do in lifts when we're bored.<br></font></p>
