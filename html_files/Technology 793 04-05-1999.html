            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE WEB<br>Top Sites collection<br>www.southwest.com.au/~joker/<br>NEWCOMERS to the Web are often baffled by the staggering amount of information out there in cyberspace.<br>A 22-year-old student and freelance technology consultant from Mandurah believes he has an answer.<br>Jason - shy about his full name and better known on the Web as Joker - has created a super site from his bookmarks designed to help ease the pain for newbies navigating the medium.<br>?I found that a lot of people didn't know what there was on the Internet, and I didn't want to carry around my bookmark file, so I created a site containing only the best of my bookmarks,? Jason said.<br>The result is called Top Sites and it assembles the best that Jason has come across.<br>At the moment about 300 sites are filed in easily-followed categories - business, computers, multimedia etc - but Jason has set a target of 2500 places to surf and is encouraging visitors to recommend inclusions.<br>People can even download a copy of the Top Sites links to their hard drives for faster retrieval by following simple instructions.<br>Jason's belief is not only do newbies find it baffling to search the Web, but they have particular difficulty in finding good Australian sites.<br>Early last week he had compiled more than 90 home-grown sites in a special category to help ease this pain.<br>FOOD<br>ChowNow - Order Asian food online<br>www.chownow.com.au<br>THE idea of ordering pizza online hit Perth earlier this year. Last Friday night it became possible to order Asian takeaway as well. ChowNow is a creation of PizzaNow's inventors, AusWeb, and another brainchild of Web developer Brian Gow.<br>It allows surfers to register for free and find their nearest Asian takeaway. Within a few clicks a hungry surfer can order from a menu and send an e-mail to the takeaway. The order and the satisfaction come the usual way - by delivery boy to the door.<br>SPORT<br>Netball Australia<br>www.netball.asn.au<br>NETBALL is a sport Australian women lead the world in. The development of this site suggests our netballing nuts are also well up when it comes to Web technology.<br>Netball Australia is powered by Flash technology which delivers a vibrant and colourful welcome to the site with moving images of a court and the sounds of whistles and cheering.<br>The site provides links to news, questionnaires, merchandise information, a calendar of major fixtures, State-based resources and a history of the game.<br></font></p>
