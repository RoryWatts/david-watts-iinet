            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Oh, no, not more socks and jocks. And that edge trimmer, new and shiny as it may be, is nothing but an unspoken instruction to abandon the remote control at the height of the cricket season and get into the garden. Don't our partners realise how important every ball of the Boxing Day Test is? Who needs presents like this?<br>On Christmas Eve the sports lover dreams about receiving the fantastic and flamboyant rather than the utilitarian and useful. Granted, golf balls are good - but it would be especially nice if we could lose them around Amen Corner at Augusta National rather than in the pond at Collier Park. Just like we'd rather enrich the bookies at Royal Ascot or Belmont Park than just plain Ascot, Belmont. Or at least look the part even if we can't play the part.<br>There's no end to the flights of fancy when hard-core sports fans compile their Christmas wish list, as this fantasy selection of the ultimate stocking fillers shows ...<br>Fast fashion<br>If it is legal and it makes you go faster, you can bet triathletes have got it - or want it for Christmas.<br>For those who want it, choosing gifts is a breeze.<br>Take the Orca wetsuit for example. It's stretchy underarm allows greater movement and reduces fatigue in the arms so why wouldn't you pay $425 for it.<br>The Speedo Blowfly goggles ensure you see those jelly fish well before you bump into them, they last longer and with refelective lenses, the glare from everybody else's rainbow silicon swim cap by Speedo won't be a bother. They cost $29.60 and $16.50 respectively.<br>It's hard to pass up the propect of going 15 per cent faster in Speedo S2000 swimwear but for $124.95 one of their best attributes is their 19 per cent better resistance to chlorine - yes, they last longer.<br>The Nike air zoom streak is one of the lightest racing flats around but once you pay $134.95 for those, don't forget you need a training shoe like the Asics gel kayano with extra gel in the forefoot for those long hauls. The $209 purchase price will deflect the attention from buying a pair of laces for $8.95, though they are the super stretch kind that no triathlete would be without.<br>Safety might be the main reason for wearing a helmet but you may as well look good at the same time in a Specialised Cobra which is lightweight, well vented and priced at $179. The cobra's tongue poking out of the front is free.<br>Speed is of the essence and that includes putting on your cycling shoes in the transition. Who wants to be wasting time with multiple straps? The Sidi triathlon shoe has one strap, a leather and mesh upper and is yours for $219.<br>Oakley's full metal jacket sunglasses have all the things you look for in eyewear - 100 per cent protection from UV and all that jazz - but for $195 you also are buying the chance to eye off the other competitors from behind reflective lenses.<br>The ultimate triathlete wouldn't be worth their salt if they didn't have a heart rate monitor ($499) and the triathlete's bike is a whole new story which we won't get into here.<br>You can kit out your favourite triathlete for race day for $1612.95. And now for the list of training gear ...<br>Wetsuit $425<br>Goggles $29.60<br>Swimcap $16.50<br>Helmet $179<br>Sunglasss $195<br>Swimwear $124.95<br>Racing flats $134.95<br>Stretch laces $8.95<br>Heart rate monitor $499<br>TOTAL $1612.95<br>Goods supplied by Bikeforce Subiaco, Runners World, Willis and Elliott Optometrists, Orca and Challenge Sports.<br>In the swing<br>NICKEL, copper, titanium. You could be working a mine in Woop Woop or studying for a degree in mineralogy. But you will actually be walking the green swards of the nation's golf courses, armed with the latest weapons to frighten and beat off that old bogey.<br>Make a note for Santa and you might land lucky. Or you can pay. Oh, how you can pay.<br>Walk in to a golf professional or a golf equipment store and the new Ping ISI will beckon you seductively.<br>?By working together, our relationship can thrive for years,? says president of the manufacturer, Karsten, in a brochure for his clubs.<br>Fifteen different grips, nine different shafts, three different types of metal on the club head, copper, nickel, stainless steel. Plus wooden woods. Plus titanium in what used to be called woods. Choose from six wedges. And all for roughly $5300 the full set.<br>Yes, that's for ONE set of golf clubs.<br>You might think that is expensive, but you ain't heard nothin' yet, as the man use to sing.<br>Honma golf clubs are made - or should it be sculpted - in Japan and are so exclusive that the very gentlemanly Mr Hwang, who imports them to Australia doesn't like talking about them.<br>?We sell no clubs in Western Australia, so I do not think I can help you,? he said with precision politeness. ?I do not think our clubs are for the public.?<br>But a salesman is a salesman and he allowed us this: ?Our quality is the best in the world. We sell many sets in Japan. In Australia men are very practical. They prefer to spend money on motor cars.?<br>Very good, but how much?<br>?There are so many different types. For instance, we have 20 different heads. We have had titanium clubs for more than four years.?<br>Yes, but how much?<br>?You can pay $2000.?<br>Not too bad compared to the Pings.<br>?Each club.?<br>Yes, there are 14 clubs in a set. Take away the putter and you have 13 clubs at $2000.<br>Of course, you could pay for a few lessons instead and keep the old snake beaters you already have in the bag.<br>Or you could send Santa a note.<br>How about something more within reach? It might be revised and updated, but not many people will revise or update their opinion of Seve Ballesteros after reading Lauren St John's biography of the Spanish golfing master, SEVE, The Biography.<br>If you have always loved Seve as a dark, mysterious genius, this will not change your opinion.<br>If Seve Ballesteros has always seemed a money-hungry, self-centred boor he will still be that.<br>All of which means that St John, golf correspondent for The Times, in London, has done a good job.<br>She lays out all of Ballesteros' attributes and his failings. If her prose at times suggests she is a true believer, she never allows it to go too far.<br>A fine book about one of the most charismatic golfers of the generation.<br>SEVE, The Biography.<br>Transworld Publishers<br>$14.95.<br>Dream team<br>WE would have preferred a World Cup spot, but Santa is only offering $100 million to buy soccer's dream team for us.<br>Big dough, but how far would it go?<br>Well, we'd need to spend about half of it to get just one player - Brazilian Denilson, who recently joined Spanish side Real Betis in a $43 million deal.<br>Other Brazilian superstars with single names, like Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Romario, Juninho, Emerson and Dodo, also cost mega bucks.<br>Two would be enough - Ronaldo and Juninho.<br>Throw in Manchester United keeper Schmeichel, his teammates Scholes and Beckham, Chelsea's Italian ace Zola, Real Madrid defender Hierro, Barcelona's Reiziger, Borussia's Kohler and Sammer and Arsenal's elegant Dutchman Bergkamp.<br>To keep the balance right - and balance the books - why not include Perth Glory's Ernie Tapai. They don't come more committed.<br>Mind you, today's dream team probably wouldn't hold a candle to an all-time dream team of golden oldies like Pele, Beckenbauer, Puskas, Best, Charlton, Zoff, Cruyff, Law, Matthews, the wayward but brilliant Maradona and Duncan Edwards, a genius who lost his life too early.<br>One can dream, can't one?<br>Forking out<br>Is money any object?<br>If not, and you like the odd ride on a tredly, Father Christmas may be able to deliver your Christmas wish.<br>Champion East Fremantle mountain bike rider, Scott Sharples, has won.<br>And for a cool $40,000 you can also have one.<br>Sharples, US based number seven downhill rider in the world is back in Perth for Christmas with his new machine.<br>?You can compere this bike to the development of formula one in motor racing, though this bike does not have an engine? Sharples said.<br>fIt is not possible to buy such a machine in Australia, because it is necessaRY to get it custom built in the US.<br>However, if you can't afford $40,000 this Christmas, wait another 12 months and you will probably be able to snap it up for a bargain $9,000.<br>Research into the machine has cost many thousands of dollars which is the reason for the enormous initial expense.<br>The forks, alone, are valued at $10,000.<br>?In the next year, the bikes will be massed produced and will retail for about $9000,? Sharples said.<br>The machine has 15cms of front wheel suspension and 17.5cms suspension in the rear.<br>It has a very strong frame, eight gears, and high handle bars to enable comfortable handling.<br>It also has hydraulic disc brakes at the front and rear and comes in three sizes - small, medium and large.David Marsh<br>Watching space<br>SHEDS used to be enough for blokes to escape to when they needed to listen to the footy, the races or the cricket on the wireless. Nowdays a complete multi-media room seems the way to go.<br>I got mine this year. It cost a pretty penny because we had to rennovate the whole house to make room for it. You might not have to take such drastic action, but believe me a room to oneself with a TV, radio and fridge is ideal for hours of sporting pleasure.<br>Mine is equipped with a 34cm TV that costs as little as $300, a computer for the true wide world of sport on the Internet (look at between $2500 and $3000), a bed for flopping down on when the Dockers miss from right in front or Warnie gets hit for six, and a pair of doors to close against those who try to ruin a bloke's weekend of sport-watching.<br>The perfect blokes' nook should also have a bar fridge, an en-suite and a library of Wisden's, Inside Sports and Tabforms.<br>Plan now. If you haven't got the room, you should see a builder soon so it will be ready for next Christmas.<br>Surf's up<br>PICTURE yourself charging down the waves at Trigg, Cottesloe, Lancelin, the Surfers Point break near Margaret River, or somewhere more exotic like Indonesia or Hawaii.<br>What better way to while away those steamy summer days than perched atop a glistening new surfboard.<br>For some 30 years Murray Smith has been recognised as one of WA's leading board makers, with a range of sticks to suit all surf breaks and body shapes.<br>A couple of the better known Smith boards are shaped by local surfers Brenton Moran and Dave Lewis.<br>Moran, one of Australia's leading malibu riders, has created a 2.4m (8ft) board with improved area and volume that retails for about $700.<br>?The mals are becoming quite popular again because they suit big or small guys, young or old riders and are perfect to ride when the swell is small in summer,? Smith said.<br>For those with something smaller and faster in mind there is the 1.96m (6ft 6in) board, shaped by Lewis, which is suited to all-round surfing at about $580.<br>Smith estimates he has personally shaped about 15,000 boards and sold more than 30,000 over the past 30 years. Formerly located in Churchlands, Smith's factory is now in Osborne Park.<br>Rolling in dough<br>What car would I have if I could have any one in the world? The ultimate car Chrissy present so to speak.<br>Jacque Villeneuve's world championship winning Williams-Renault springs to mind. This is the pinnicle of motorsport after all, the cutting edge of automotive technology, the best of the best and all that. What could be better than the best car in the best championship in the world.<br>One without quite as much accident damage for a start. The sleek speedster finished the season on top after barely surviving Michael Schumacher trying to drive his Ferrari through the side entrance in the final race.<br>Several months earlier, Schumacher's teammate, Eddie Irvine, did a better job on the first turn at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne albeit on the other side of the car.<br>Then there are all those stains from sprayed Moet and Chandon.<br>Besides what would I do with the thing? Only in my dreams can I drive as well as Villeneuve, the car is illegal for next year's championship and no registration authority in the world would give you a licence plate for it.<br>Even if they did, where could the missus sit for a quick spin around the block? And can you imagine handing the keys to the valet parking guy at Burswood?<br>Desirable yes, practical no. Sorry Frank, no sale.<br>Logic dictates that the Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR is a much more viable but no less emotive choice.<br>Mercedes has announced that they will build a limted number of road-going versions of the car that dominated the 1997 FIA-GT championship, leaving McLarens, Porsches and Ferraris in its wake.<br>Loosely styled on the sexy CLK coupe the GTR is a virtual F1 disguised as a street car. Carbon fibre and other exotic composite materials abound and power comes from a thumping 6-litre V12 with more horses than Ascot.<br>If Ferraris are the cars for under-endowed males then this is the one for a eunuch.<br>The queue forms outside the Mercedes-Benz Sales department, 70546, Stuttgart, Deutschland but don't expect any change out of around $1.3 million and they only come in left-hand-drive.<br>Just the ticket<br>ALL I want for Christmas is my two front seats. Wimbledon centre court would be nice, but I wouldn't quibble if I had to settle for a corporate box on the 18th at Augusta National or Royal Birkdale, a Super Bowl ticket, a reserved spot in the turn one grandstand at Indy or Casino Square at Monaco, or ... oh ... paddock entry to Royal Ascot on Ladies Day.<br>Let's face it: sports fanatics are not television junkies. They like to be there and find a way to get there. You see them following the Aussie cricket team around the Caribbean, scrounging tickets outside Olympic Games venues, trying to slip unnoticed through the delivery entrance at Madison Square Gardens, Ellis Park or Wembley and drinking in the same pubs as their sporting heroes.<br>Of course, if you have a bit of money it makes it so much easier, if less adventurous. Sports holidays are a booming business and several Melbourne-based companies will get you into the event of your fancy - for a price.<br>Four nights in a deluxe London hotel next July, centre court tickets for the second Friday, Saturday and Sunday of Wimbledon, plus a West End show of your choice when the rain turns the tournament into Swimbledon, will set you back $7690. Three-night packages earlier in the fortnight start at $1250.<br>The US Masters in April is the other big-ticket event that everyone aspires to attend. Four nights in a local hotel and two days' entry to Augusta National (the demand is so high the sessions are decided by ballot) will set you back about $4500.<br>By comparison, five nights in a San Francisco hotel and admission to all four days of the US Open at the Olympic Club next June is a bargain at $2590.<br>The British Open at Royal Birkdale in July is another entrance-by-lottery event, but two days of watching the world's best should whet your appetite to swing a club yourself - and where better to do so than St Andrews. Old Course, naturally. Green fees are $160, but you'll probably need a $10,000 sweetener to the club secretary to get a tee-off time in the next decade on the world's most famous links.<br>If you're going to be in London in mid-summer, you might as well rent a morning suit and Roller and head to Royal Ascot on June 18 for the Gold Cup. Admission to grandstand and paddock, plus nosh and booze, will set you back $550.<br>If it's horsepower you want, three nights' accommodation plus entry to the Indianapolis 500 and passes to Gasoline Alley and the Hall of Fame museum will cost about $2500. The price includes ear plugs - which will probably be necessary, too, at Super Bowl XXXII in San Diego, where a bed for three nights and a ticket in the upper end zone stand will be $3790.<br>Melbourne companies Sports International (03-96706627) or Paul Salmon Tours (03-9428-09126) will gladly swap your money for their entrance tickets.<br></font></p>
