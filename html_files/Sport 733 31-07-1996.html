            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">In an event as big as the Olympic Games, what makes headlines in one country barely rates a mention in another.<br>DAVID WATTS examines some rampant parochiality.<br>CHANNEL 7 diving commentator Steve Foley told the Egyptian judge to ?ride his camel home? after he gave Australia's Michael Murphy a low score yesterday. It was more than parochialism; it bordered on xenophobia.<br>Foley's comments were at the extreme end of the one-eyed scale at these Olympics. But this sort of bias is not the sole preserve of the Australian media, despite the fears voiced daily by letter writers to The West Australian.<br>The NBC network did not show Kieren Perkins' magnificent 1500m freestyle victory because there were no Americans in the event.<br>Atlanta's hometown paper, the Constitution-Journal, gave Perkins only two short paragraphs and concentrated on US swimming dominance on the only day Australia was a clear winner in the pool.<br>The Irish Times, as it had all week, gave Michelle Smith the headlines even though beaten well by Australians Susie O'Neill and Petria Thomas in the 200m butterfly.<br>The Olympics might be the greatest global event, drawing almost 200 nations together - but forget balance when it comes to reporting.<br>This is war where winning and national pride are everything. The fact that television coverage is close to universal - the Games are telecast to 170 countries - and the Internet now allows people to choose newspaper coverage from any country every minute of the day even before the real paper is delivered to the domestic consumer - matters not one iota.<br>The thrust of media reporting is: where did our brave boys or girls come? And if they did not win a medal, why not? And, in the case of our swimmers, if that medal was bronze why wasn't it silver or gold?<br>Or if the time was slower than expected, why? Or if the winner was faster than expected - and came from another country - what drugs were they taking?<br>Reason has gone out the door even, or especially, among the so-called quality newspapers of the world which pride themselves on tackling world rather than parish-pump issues.<br>The Washington Post, regarded by journalists and opinion makers as one of the great journals of the Western world, had only news of US athletes on its main Olympic page on Monday.<br>THIS was a day when Americans won only two golds. The main report was about Carl Lewis qualifying for the long jump.<br>The Cape Times of South Africa led with two reports about breaststroke phenomenon Penelope Heyns.<br>The Times in London had 27 reports on the Games. Only three focused on athletes from countries other than Britain. One even bemoaned the poor British record in judo.<br>In Berlin last week, Die Welt gnashed its teeth - Australian style - over the lack of gold medals.<br>Our neighbours New Zealand cover the Games exactly as we do - they put themselves first.<br>They have good reason: NZ's performances, particularly Danyon Loader's double swimming gold, are way out of proportion to the size of the population.<br>Three million New Zealanders have so far watched their country win three times as many gold as Britain's 55 million.<br></font></p>
