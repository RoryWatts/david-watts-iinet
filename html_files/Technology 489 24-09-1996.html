            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE best book about computers and the Internet is not on paper yet, nor is it particularly accurate or scientific.<br>But American humorist Dave Barry certainly hits some home truths in his wicked look at the history of computing called A Brief History of Computing: From Cave Walls to Windows95 (Not That This is Necessarily Progress).<br>The 14 chapters are being presented one by one on the World Wide Web every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. By yesterday he had dispensed with eight.<br>Barry, whose syndicated Miami Herald column used to appear in The West Australian, does not let facts get in the way of a good story. But this irreverent approach coupled with his zany sense of humour - he is the world expert on seeing how far a Roller Barbie doll will travel when set alight - should not stop computing professionals and purists.<br>In his first chapter, Man, the Computing Animal, Barry claims: ?The first human beings didn't need computers, because they had no numbers.<br>?This was a big problem for parents, because they had no way to control their children ("You kids stop that! I mean it! I'm going to count to ... um ... to ...')<br>Other chapters include The Alternative World of Apple, a computer Barry says is fit only ?for drug addicts and Barry Manilow? because it actually responds to the user rather than setting them a titanic struggle like Windows.<br>The book will vanish from cyberspace on October 9.<br>URL: www.yil.com/yil/dbarry/index.html<br></font></p>
