            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INDEED it was a grand time to be Irish at the weekend, to be sure .. . then again it was not.<br>The international rules clash at the MCG on Friday night was all about intoxicating merriment. It had speed, physicality and, on Ireland's part anyway, ball-handling skills.<br>By stark contrast, the rugby World Cup encounter between Australia and Ireland late on Sunday (or early yesterday if you were stuck with Channel 7 rather than Foxtel), was about poverty and scrapping for a living, with a dash of brutality and pub brawling thrown in.<br>The rules match, enlivened by a 65,000 crowd some of whom came dressed as leprechauns, was a joy to behold.<br>The crowd made so much noise that Robert O'Dipierdomenico on the sideline often did not know what was going on. The pace and constant counter-attacking by both sides had Padraigh O'Morphett mistaking players and making no sense at all.<br>So what's new, you ask.<br>On the field, it was blistering entertainment the whole time. Clive O'Waterhouse and Rory O'Cousins gave their all while Nathan McBuckley set the game alight.<br>There was barely a lull for Seven's advertisements. There were no beg-pardons and even a moderate stoush.<br>In the rugby, the action for much of the game centred on the sideline where players with bleeding head wounds were sent regularly.<br>If we weren't watching on-the-spot doctoring, we were yawning at the procession of scrums and line-outs caused by the fumbles and dud kicks that littered this game.<br>And if it wasn't for the tries of Tim Horan and Ben Tune, and the inventive play of halfback George Gregan, this would have been a disaster.<br>But even if it was, rugby's place on the world sporting stage is assured. Australian rules, Gaelic football and the wonderful mixture of the two is still too insular and domestic to compete.<br>This was best illustrated on Saturday night when the AFL showed off Essendon and Hawthorn at The Oval in London. Only 20km away at Twickenham, England took on New Zealand in the World Cup.<br>That 20km became 100 light years as it became apparent the AFL match seemed purely for the entertainment of expatriate Australians.<br>They had a great time kicking the footy at the breaks and huddling around the huddles and they saw some half-decent football.<br>But at Twickenham it was war. Even the singing of the national anthems had a sense of combat. Then came the haka and an hour later Jonah Lomu running over the top of Englishmen as if they were fluffy pillows.<br>In a month, overseas AFL games and international rules will be a faint if enjoyable memory for Australians and Irish alike.<br>But at the same time, some nation - maybe Australia - will be home to the rugby World Cup.<br></font></p>
