            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT is probably too hot to worry about sport on television at the moment.<br>But it is the curious fate of armchair fans at this time of the year to be left panting for a dose of the Boxing Day Test.<br>This has brought the strange pleasure of watching rain and cool weather and asking ?what is that stuff??<br>It has also brought some lovely cricket between showers and Channel 9's attempts to fill screen time.<br>Michael Slater, Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting love to bat, which in turn has made them lovely to watch. There have even been times when the Indians have been combative and aggressive as they try to take the initiative for once.<br>So far, even with the rain, this Test has been good for the game. It has endorsed the view of the venerable British magazine, the Economist, which last week nominated cricket as the paramount sport in the world.<br>In a serious essay on whether size matters in sport, the Economist concluded that cricket gave athletes of all body types and ages the best chance to demonstrate skill and courage while providing spectators with entertainment not dominated by the freakish super bodies needed in sports such as basketball or American football.<br>The Melbourne Test - when it is actually being played - certainly matches the Economist's standards.<br>But for those of us with Foxtel, there has been another example of Test cricket that must be making the author of the Economist's feature reach for the delete button.<br>The first day of the South Africa-England Test in Durban blighted Fox screens through Sunday evening and into the night.<br>A hard-core cricket buff would have seen England reach 2-135 off 85.1 overs at the scintillating run rate of 1.59 an over. Compare that with Australia's 3.59 when it reached 5-300 yesterday.<br>Of course it is an unfair comparison. Everything is different, the conditions, the combatants, but most definitely the confidence factor.<br>And Test cricket is not only about run rates.<br>However, this tedium was witnessed by a healthy crowd of English supporters who nearly brought the stands down when a single was scored after about seven consecutive maidens.<br>Wisden commented yesterday that it was a slow, strange day with England satisfied that winning the toss was success enough.<br>The BBC reeked of understatement when it said England would have to lift its game.<br>What it makes of the Economist's boast about cricket is difficult to say.<br>In Melbourne, cricket is alive and well, if wet. In Durban, it is dying of thirst.<br>But all armchair fans know . . . cricket's a funny, old game.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
