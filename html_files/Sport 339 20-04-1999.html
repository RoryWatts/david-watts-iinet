            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WITH football already so exhausting, is it necessary for Channel 7 to keep putting a big muffler on screen?<br>An exhaust system is exactly what the station's scoreline looks like ... a big and annoying exhaust system at that.<br>It is all very well to gasp at Melbourne punching through the winning point, at Tony Francis bouncing out of nowhere to put St Kilda in front with a minute left, or at Paul Kelly acting as if he was three times the size and shrugging off defenders to put Sydney one kick away from an improbable victory.<br>But what use is it if the TV screen is crowded with graphics?<br>For a start, there is a smallish - but impenetrable - board at the top left of screen.<br>Then there is Seven's watermark logo at top right.<br>With each new score the muffler heaves into view right across the bottom.<br>And players get a scrolled out profile, rolling down the right and obscuring views, when the camera focuses on them.<br>Then there are the match-ups across the top.<br>These appear for no apparent reason other than to give the boxful of commentators more to talk about.<br>Somewhere in the middle of this jam is an exciting game of football.<br>Seven's over-the-top presentation of the AFL season is irritating a lot of people.<br>An Internet newsgroup devoted to football has been turned on to the topic for the past few days, with more than 20 people e-mailing their displeasure in one day.<br>One wrote: ?Am I the only one who is driven nuts by all the movement all over the screen other than the actual players?<br>?The way the game is looking on Channel 7 these days I am surprised there isn't some sort of skill, stamina or pace bar which appears each time a player gets the ball.<br>?It's looking like a computer game, not a sports coverage.?<br>A regular reader of this column wrote to say that as far back as round one he had simply turned off the TV and listened to radio when confronted with the graphic overload.<br>Seven's screen looks almost decadent when compared with the ABC's minimalist approach to Westar Rules coverage.<br>On Saturday, the national broadcaster showed Perth's surprise two-point win over East Fremantle. It was not fancy, it was not skilful - indeed Ross Glendinning and Wally Foreman were almost reduced to tears of laughter when Perth's Joe Smith played on and forgot there was a man on the mark only a few metres ahead.<br>But it was exciting and dramatic, just like Melbourne-Hawthorn or St Kilda-Bulldogs.<br>And there was barely a graphic in sight.<br>Every now and then an unobtrusive reminder of the score would pop down.<br>The clock showed the time elapsed so it was edge-of-the-seat viewing not knowing exactly when the siren would sound.<br>One day Seven might let the game dominate the screen and leave the fancy stuff back on the drawing board where it belongs.<br>I'd like to see that.<br></font></p>
