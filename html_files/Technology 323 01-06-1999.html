            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FRIEND asked me recently to show her how to use the Internet so she could ?go on the shopping channel?.<br>I explained there was no specific channel. There were thousands of different places to burn a hole in your credit card.<br>But she seemed baffled. It is not an atypical reaction from either new or non-Net users, particularly those older than about 35 who have little experience of computing.<br>A fairly big slice of the population tends to see the Net as a form of television where content is pushed at a passive audience.<br>Most Federal politicians are in the same boat, given how easily they succumbed to the Net censorship legislation of Communications Minister Richard Alston.<br>Senator Alston ignored the outcry of experienced Net users, more than 100 submissions to a Senate committee saying the legislation would not work, and even a US senator who pleaded with Australia not to tamper with freedom of expression.<br>Senator Alston has admitted the legislation will not be totally effective in filtering out pornographic and violent content.<br>But he has been able to get his way because of the lack of understanding about the Net.<br>His opponents have turned Web pages black, marched through the streets of capital cities, sent senators copies of George Orwell's 1984, bombarded politicians with e-mail and mounted technically literate arguments all over the Net.<br>Senator Alston has lost nothing by barely acknowledging them.<br>His audience has been those who still see the medium as an exciting but challenging form of TV. The senator has manipulated fears by repeating the words ?paedophile? and ?bomb-making recipe?. The ease with which he rammed censorship through shows how those inaccurate portrayals still hold a powerful grip.<br>Prime Minister John Howard has been otherwise occupied with the Democrats and the GST, but took some time last week to claim that anti-censorship protesters did not understand the mood of middle Australia.<br>?What the community wants is protection of young people against certain material on the Internet, I think that is absolutely defensible,? he told Adelaide radio 5DN.<br>Absolutely correct. But by the Government? With legislation that Senator Alston admits will not be totally effective? With legislation that equates Net content with TV and videos?<br>Censorship opponents will maintain their rage. But in some forums they are starting to debate whether they need to move their attacks into more traditional media such as letters (rather than e-mail) to politicians and letters to the editor.<br>S OME admit they have relied too much on the Net and preached to the converted. Senator Alston has not relied on the Net and preached to the yet-to-be-converted, who still outnumber Netizens.<br>Censorship opponents hold out the hope that Senator Alston will ultimately lose his job - they dislike his legislation that much - because of the continuing rapid growth in users.<br>The Australian Bureau of Statistics last week estimated 16 per cent of all households had home access, a rise of nearly 280 per cent from 1996.<br>Within a year or two those who think the Net is like TV will know better. Whether they will enjoy access as fast and as cheap as it is now will test whether the Net community or Senator Alston is right about censorship.<br>And pornography and violence ... they will still be there.<br></font></p>
