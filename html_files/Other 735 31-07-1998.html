            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">(Memo: One-Eyed View from Section Controller Of Today - This is an entertainment section, please do not write about the Eagles and the Dockers.)<br>(Memo: SCOT from OEV - No worries chum, take a look at this . . . )<br>THE encroachment of the Spice Girls and South Park on the junk culture of my household had to stop. I needed to act firmly, but fairly.<br>So I bound and gagged the children and made them watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br>By the time the Knights Who Say Nick had said ?nick?, they were chortling. Within hours of the end of the film they were both able to sing the Lumberjack Song right through and, with barely a slip-up, recite the Dead Parrot sketch.<br>Their next test, now that they have almost forgotten Posh and Scary and who killed Kenny, will be to perform the You Were Lucky sketch, the one in which several old northerners relate what life was like when they were young.<br>You know the one . . . ?We used to live in a shoebox in the middle of road? . . . ?You were lucky, we used to live in a lake? . . . and so on to the conclusion: ?You try and tell that to the young people of today and they won't believe you.?<br>I am expecting some flak from the kiddies, however. They seem to think this is not a sketch, but a slice of real life enacted by their parents every morning before school.<br>It starts when I see them lounging by the heater, watching cartoons and waiting to be served Fruit Loops. ?When I were young,? I trumpet in a Yorkshire accent (for no better reason than that's how the Python team spoke). ?When I were young, I'd have to get up at five, go out in the frost in my bare feet and chop half a tonne of firewood from the log pile so we could light the stove and have a hot hotplate to cook me da's porridge on.<br>?Then I had to hop on my bike and do the shopping before going to school where I had to clean the blackboard, ring the bell, empty the rubbish and say the Lord's Prayer. And I were only four.?<br>I suspect I tell them this because my own dad used to say to me of a winter's morning - while I was warming his porridge - "How old are you son?? "Four, dad.? ?Why when I were your age I was seven.?<br>IT MAKES you wonder what Mick Malthouse and Gerard Neesham will be talking about when they are old and in their armchairs.<br>MM: ?When I were young, I always said the Earth is patient but the ox is slow.?<br>GN: ?And no one believed ya. But Mick you were lucky. You didn't have a team of four knee reconstructions, a crook shoulder and countless dodgy groins and hammies. When I were young I had to play kiddies week in and week out, and by and large they did the Dockers proud.?<br>(SCOT to OEV: I'm warning you chum, no footy.)<br>MM: ?But Gerard, remember what I always said . . . what grows well, grows slowly. Anyway you were lucky. When I were young no one liked my style of ruthless, choking, dour but effective football. They all jumped up and down with excitement at your fellas.?<br>GN: ?That weren't excitement, that were heart attacks. Near enough gave me a couple as well.?<br>MM and GN: ?And you try and tell that to the young people of today and they'll say . . .?<br>Come on Benny, go Jess, you beaut Woosha, up there Spider, stop him Millie, way to go Dirty Harry . . .<br>(SCOT to OEV: Stop that. I warned you. There's too much footy already.)<br>(OEV to SCOT: Oh no there isn't. Good luck Eagles, all the best Dockers.)<br>(SCOT to OEV: You're fired.)<br></font></p>
