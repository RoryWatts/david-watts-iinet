            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIA'S Academy Award hope Shine has won global approval well ahead of the Oscar ceremonies on March 24.<br>The dramatised biography of eccentric Perth piano genius David Helfgott is rated the eighth most popular film at the Internet Movie Database, a repository of facts and trivia covering more than 50,000 films.<br>Internet users can cast votes for movies at the data base's site on the World Wide Web. They rate them on a scale of 1 (lousy) to 10 (excellent).<br>In the latest publication of the top 250, Net surfers have rated Shine better than critically acclaimed classics such as Casablanca, Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction.<br>A total of 652 people had cast a vote for Shine at the time of the top 250 publication and given it an average score of 9.3.<br>The curators of the data base - all film buffs who give free time to maintain the electronic treasure trove - have weighted scores for all movies so that they have a common base. This helps clear up the distortions caused when 2000 people give one film an average of 7.5, and 250 people give another film an average of 8.5.<br>Mathematical weighting brings clearer averaging and levels the playing field.<br>On that basis, Shine's 9.3 has been converted to 8.7, putting it behind fellow Oscar nominee The English Patient, which has a weighted score of 8.8, gleaned from the 1217 voters whose average mark for the adaptation of the best-selling novel was 9.1.<br>Other nominees Jerry Maguire (21st) and Fargo (28th) also feature prominently on the list.<br>Shine's weighted vote puts it ahead of previous Oscar winners Schindler's List (14th), Braveheart (18th) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (23rd), among many others.<br>The top 250 list owes a lot to the demographics of Net users. Recent US surveys say that the average age of the world's 45 million Net population is 33 and the male-female ratio is 70-30.<br>The Net population has aged rapidly from an average 25 years old in 1994, and the sex quotient has changed dramatically since then too when the male-female ratio was 90-10.<br>But many movie votes were cast when the Net was younger and more testosterone-charged.<br>Thus the top 10 movies are: 1 Star Wars, 2 The Shawshank Redemption, 3 Trainspotting, 4 The English Patient, 5 The Wrong Trousers, 6 A Close Shave, 7 The Usual Suspects, 8 Shine, 9 Star Trek (First Contact) and 10 Casablanca.<br>Internet Movie Database can be found at: http://www.imdb.com<br>Another site, Mr Showbiz, also rates Shine highly.
