            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN AUSTRALIA we have a sort of right to free speech that allows this type of incisive and accurate political commentary: Gough Whitlam is a big man; so is Malcolm Fraser. John Howard isn't.<br>Play it safe like that and chances are the freedom fighters at Parliament House in Canberra will not sue. Keep this in mind while perusing the following.<br>The cavalier king charles spaniel is an affectionate, playful, intelligent and silly little dog that makes one of the world's best pets and worst watchdogs. A burglar can help himself to the family jewels provided he tickles the cavalier's tummy after breaking and entering.<br>Cavaliers are descended from the small toy spaniels seen in so many of the 16th, 17th and 18th century paintings by Titian, Van Dyck and Gainsborough. Under the Stuart kings they were given the royal title of king charles spaniels. King Charles II was seldom seen without two or three at his heels, according to historians.<br>And he was so fond of his little dogs that he decreed the breed should be accepted in any public place ... even the Houses of Parliament where four-legged animals were not usually allowed.<br>This decree still exists, according to the US Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Association.<br>One of the main jobs performed by cavaliers through the ages has been that of companion. In fact, it was bred originally to warm laps in drafty castles and on chilly carriage rides; hence the term lap dog.<br>A prescription written a few hundred years ago for a long-dead (but possibly happy) Queen of England directed her to keep a ?comforte dog? on her lap to treat a cold.<br>Cavaliers are said to relieve stress. Because of this and their companionable ways they have been the dog of choice for all members of the British royal family as children. The corgi is now the adult choice.<br>Former US president Ronald Reagan kept cavaliers to keep the stress down, too. They obviously worked. Anecdotal evidence is that Mr Reagan was so relaxed during his presidency he would take an afternoon nap while his policies went forth to cause stress to others.<br>Now this compelling weight of evidence should be used for the public good. Our Government should institute the King Charles II decree here and allow cavaliers in Parliament House.<br>They would be a novel addition to Question Time. Hon. Member: ?I ask the Minister for Inland Drainage what he intends to do about feral cats.?<br>Hon. Minister: ?My Government will rid the nation of them.?<br>Cavalier: ?Woof, woof, bark, yip? (translation hear, hear, old chap).<br>Cavaliers could even soothe the controversial independent Member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson.<br>Pure observation shows her to be the most stressed politician around. Her mouth is pulled to a thin line, her face is taut and angry and she rarely gives a hint of a smile as she makes comments that have the neighbouring South-East Asian press foaming at the headlines ... and Tim Fischer ready to blow his top (no wonder he wears that hat).<br>But a cavalier on Ms Hanson's lap could help. One wrapped around her mouth might be the choice of others, but I didn't say that.<br>???<br>NEEDLE in a haystack: the other night at Cinema Paradiso in Northbridge, my friends and I were waiting for the busy, on-call doctor husband of one of our party. We decided to go into the cinema to watch the intriguing Australian drama What I Have Written. The doctor's wife asked the woman in the box office to look out for him and direct him to our film because he had been told only that we would be at the Paradiso at 6.30; not what film nor which cinema.<br>?What does he look like?? asked the box office woman. ?Oh, he's dark and Italian-looking,? said the wife.<br>In James Street, Northbridge ... somehow he found us.<br></font></p>
