            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET users in New South Wales took their previously virtual protest against planned censorship laws to the streets of Sydney yesterday under the shadow of a leaked document they claim confirms their worst fears about draconian intervention by the State Government.<br>Daniel Yee, spokesman for Electronic Freedom March organisers Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA), said that the uproar from NSW's estimated 300,000 Net users since Attorney-General Jeff Shaw announced censorship plans last month had been greeted by government silence.<br>Hundreds of protests have flooded newsgroups and World Wide Web sites because users feel the Net will be made unworkable by government ignorance about its benefits.<br>Mr Shaw said last month that the State planned to stop pornography and other objectionable material being made available to children.<br>Fines up to $25,000 and six-month jail terms were mentioned as penalties for anyone who allowed objectionable material on the Net.<br>The EFA and many other protesters claim the NSW legislation would make moderately steamy love letters in e-mail illegal and ban many worthy Web sites, including great works of art as well as stop the transmission of any material rated MA, such as Academy Award winning film scripts.<br>Mr Yee says the leaked copy of the proposed legislation shows it has two major parts.<br>?The first makes it a crime to "transmit objectionable (RC or X-rated) material on the Internet' or for "an Internet service provider (ISP) to permit objectionable material to be available for access or retrieval by users of the Internet',? Mr Yee said.<br>?The second makes it illegal for a person to transmit or advertise unsuitable material to minors, or for an ISP to "permit material unsuitable for minors to be available for access or retrieval by a minor using the Internet'.<br>?This may sound innocent, but there are some terrible problems with it.<br>?The legislation defines "transmit' as "send or receive', so you could be in trouble if you accidentally click on a link to an objectionable image or someone malicious sends you one by e-mail.<br>?This legislation would make it illegal to put MA-rated material on a Web page or to post it to a Usenet newsgroup or an open mailing list, but there is no way to verify that the people who access these are over 15 years of age.<br>?We can say goodbye to discussion forums for drug users, victims of sexual abuse and, perhaps, even nursing mothers.<br>?Banning material unsuitable for minors so broadly is an extraordinary infringement of free speech. An equivalent would be removing all MA-rated material from libraries and making it illegal to tell a dirty joke in a pub without checking that everyone within earshot is of an appropriate age.<br>?Such measures are also totally ineffective because less than 0.1 per cent of the Internet's content resides on computers inside NSW.?<br>He reiterated comments made by dozens of submissions to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's inquiry into online services that parents, teachers and system managers could screen offensive material already with self-censoring software such as NetNanny and CyberPatrol.<br>?Such schemes also respect the rights of adults to read and see what they want,? Mr Yee said.<br>He said the planned intervention in the role of ISPs, such as random checks on content, would make their job unworkable and could destroy NSW's online industry.<br>?For ISPs to monitor what their users send and receive would be a gross violation of civil liberties,? Mr Yee said. ?It is as if Telstra were to listen in on phone calls.<br>?Requiring ISPs to do on-the-spot rating of material at the whim of anyone on the Internet is also completely unworkable.?<br>URL: www.efa.org.au<br>EFA Newsgroups: aus.org.efa and aus.politics<br></font></p>
