            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.au All sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>www.sothebys.com<br>You don't have to be driven around in a stretch limousine to shop at Sotheby's in London, the world's most famous auction house. According to this official site, more than half the goods that go under the hammer sell for $5000 or less. The high profile of valuable art works sold there just give the impression that Sotheby's is for the snooty or stinking rich. You cannot yet bid for auction items via e-mail, but the site still has much to recommend, not least the chance to browse through collections of items coming up for sale. These include 19th century Impressionist and contemporary paintings and a silver tureen by the noted Juste-Aurle Meissonnier. Information on what objects might be worth a pretty penny around your own house, how to arrange sales with Sotheby's and a look at previous sales are highlights. (DW)<br>French Open<br>www.frenchopen.org<br>Early deadlines mean this is being written without knowing how far Patrick Rafter progressed in the first tennis grand slam of the year. Although it was known that number one seed Pete Sampras had been thrashed in the second round. Whatever . . . the French Open site delivers up-to-the-minute news, scores and photos from Roland Garos in Paris with the impressive IBM technology that drives all the grand slam sites. You can send postcards of encouragement to the player of your choice, check live action with the Net Cam or browse through the hundred or so biographies of the competitors. (DW)<br>Monkey Dog<br>www.monkeydog.com<br>Charles Fleischer was the voice of Roger Rabbit, so it's no surprise his Web site is delightfully insane. In addition to some fascinating computer artwork and poetry, Fleischer offers ?Moleeds?, a mathematical formula he discovered that ?reveals the blueprint of infinity?. The site also features an insult engine, which will produce customised barbs in modern, Shakespearean, street, PG and adult formats. Fleischer says his site is called Monkeydog.com because everything else he wanted was taken. (WP)<br>Oh the Humanity! The Worst Movies on Earth<br>www.ohthehumanity.com<br>Dedicated to the dreadful is one way to describe Oh the Humanity! Its look at the B movie genre is entertaining, probably more so than the films it reviews. And what a treasury of schlock there is. Movies that get the thumbs up - or down, depending on your point of view - include Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai; Alien Terminator; Avenging Disco Godfather; Class of Nuke "Em High Part II; Don't Tell Mom, the Babysitter's Dead; Godzilla vs. Megalon; Krull; Michael Jackson's Moonwalker; Urban Cowboy and Xanadu. (DW)<br>The Dog Hause<br>www.doghause.com<br>This site, designed for pet lovers, has a surprising amount of wisdom. For example: ?Whoever said you can't buy happiness forgot little puppies.? Or: ?The more people I meet the more I like my dog.? Pardon the pun, but it seems to be barking up the right tree in providing animal lovers with information about pet care, quotations and poems.
