            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I REALLY can't recall, but I believe Carmen Lawrence is a big name. But how big?<br>The World Wide Web surely should be able to tell us.<br>Using the search tools, Lycos, Yahoo Search and Webcrawler, the words Carmen Lawrence unearthed some interesting, even baffling, results.<br>She simply doesn't exist, according to Yahoo. But Lycos found 6238 documents with either Carmen or Lawrence mentioned.<br>It summarised the first 10 of these 6238 findings, and lo and behold the first two of the 10 results were from the same document: Introduction to this special issue on computer-supported cooperative work.<br>That's one for the bookmarks.<br>Something told me this wasn't our Carmen, Member for Fremantle and Federal Health Minister.<br>Life was too short to check the other 6236 results, so bring in the trusty Webcrawler.<br>Sanity, at last.<br>Nineteen documents, with the third one, Cabinet and the Ministry. This was indeed her, along with Paul Keating, Kim Beazley, Gareth Evans et al, and accompanying photographs and potted biographies.<br>Cause for more than a little bewilderment was that this search result was only number three.<br>The two entries above it were Midwifery, Pregnancy and Birth Related Information and Investigadores del Centro.<br>Curiouser and curiouser on the list of 19 was number 9, The Miss Piggy Page, number 18, the Vampyres Film List and lucky last number 19, http://gip.eecs.umich. edu/OO/FAQ/Recreation/Star-Trek<br>.Actors-Roles.Part3.1.<br>So Dr Lawrence is really a Klingon ... enough of that. Beam me up Scottie, there's precious little intelligent life down here, and in the interests of bipartisanship I sought Webcrawler's response to the request Richard Court.<br>Naturally the word Court caused paroxysms of search mania, with the result being 349 finds.<br>Nestled among the first 25 results were the fascinatingly boring titles: About the court and judges and Bankruptcy creditors' service Inc.<br>More intriguing, but way off the path to the Premier's door was The Rec. Nude Legal FAQ, rev. 7/1/95.<br>Ah ha! Richard the naked truth, but no. Further up the list was Richard's Home Page.<br>Paydirt, I thought. Mr Court has joined the illustrious company of his sworn enemy Prime Minister Paul Keating, who has his own home page, but which has not been updated since June.<br>Still it's nice to have a photograph of the PM on his every utterance.<br>But Richard's Home Page was no such effort by the Premier. No, it was Curtin student Richard Giles extolling the virtues of his faculty and the Bentley Technology Park.<br></font></p>
