            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA INTERNET users will have the chance to discuss crucial issues, including censorship and timed calls, at the first general public meeting of the WA Internet Association tonight.<br>Telstra's recent bid to introduce timed local data calls, its strategies for coping with increasing demands of the Net, WA's Censorship Act and the Melbourne-based monopoly on domain names are among major topics on the agenda.<br>WAIA spokesman and Perth lawyer Kimberley Heitman will present the censorship discussion. He said he wanted to raise issues about WA's censorship laws, enacted last year, and how they affected users and Internet access providers (IAPs).<br>He also said that the domain name issue needed to be aired as the WAIA had been vocal in efforts to release the monopoly held by Melbourne IT over the maintenance of the ?com.au? domain name space, and its charging procedures.<br>The WAIA's efforts had led to some concessions that would allow competition.<br>On the timed calls issue, Mr Heitman said: ?WAIA will continue to defend untimed phone calls for the benefit of small and medium-sized Internet access providers and low income users.?<br>Telstra communications consultant Ross Davies would speak at the meeting about Telstra's product range.<br>The meeting will be held at The QV1 Conference Centre, Level 2, 250 St Georges Terrace, at 6.45pm.<br>URL: www.waia.asn.au<br></font></p>
