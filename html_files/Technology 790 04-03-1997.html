            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TELSTRA'S perceived ambition to make Internet users pay more for services raised temperatures at the WA Internet Association's first public meeting last week.<br>WAIA spokesman Kim Davies said the session introduced by Telstra communications consultant Ross Davies attracted heated debate.<br>Mr Davies told more than 70 people at the meeting of Telstra's impact on Internet Service Providers.<br>He said Telstra Big Pond Direct was not an ISP except when dealing with permanent connections, and On Australia was just an ISP, nothing more.<br>Mr Davies also told the meeting the Public Switched Telephone Network was undervalued because of Net use.<br>Last month Telstra executives told the Senate committee inquiring into the part-privatisation of Telstra that timed local calls were needed because increasing Net use was forcing up Telstra's costs.<br>Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston stamped on the Telstra bid for timed local voice and data calls, and for timed business voice calls.<br>But he has left the door open for Telstra to charge timed business data calls, which many users see as a way for ISPs to be charged heavily.<br>Debate on the subject is starting to escalate among subscribers to the Stop Telstra mailing list. Many have received email from the department and Telstra, which they claim makes clear Telstra's intention to force Net users to bear increased costs.<br></font></p>
