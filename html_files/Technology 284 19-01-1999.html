            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE US ruled against government censorship of the Internet in 1996.<br>Pennsylvania District Judge Steward Dalzell said in his judgment against the Communications Decency Act that the Net ?may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation?.<br>This conversation can become pretty silly at times, unfortunately.<br>The latest outbreak of absurdity concerns the Disney studio and the 1977 animated film, The Rescuers.<br>Dozens of people are trying to flog copies of a video of the film for as much as $50.<br>Their for-sale notices are posted in several Disney-related newsgroups on the Net, and may be seen, or responded to, by simply typing the word ?rescuers? in the search box at the DejaNews Web site.<br>The fuss over this unremarkable movie started a fortnight ago when Disney took the unprecedented step of withdrawing from sale 3.4 million copies of the video that went on sale in North America on January 5.<br>An American fundamentalist group, the American Life League, had reported to Disney that the torso of a naked woman was visible in a whole two frames of the 110,000-frame video.<br>The image cannot be seen when the video is watched at normal viewing speed. But those with the inclination can freeze-frame it to have a look.<br>According to CNN, Disney recalled the video ?to keep our promise to families that we can trust and rely on the Disney brand to provide the finest in family entertainment?.<br>The offending picture was inserted in the film after the cartoon was drawn, according to Disney spokesmen. The image was on copies sent to cinemas for a re-release but, as with the video, was not visible when shown at normal speed.<br>The American Life League which started this brouhaha has its own Web site. Here it challenges the right to abortion, as well as promoting press releases with titles such as ?Non-white children - Bad for the world's future??<br>But it makes no mention of the naughty bits in The Rescuers.<br>Neither does Disney at its new hard-selling Go.com site.<br>But the ALL's complaint over something that is almost impossible to see and Disney's mass withdrawal has caused idle minds on the Net to go a bit wild.<br>That is one of the problem with a fast, global medium like the Net. Trivial matters balloon out of all importance.<br>People try to cash in. Several of those trying to sell copies of The Rescuers for between $25 and $50 openly admit they want to make some money out of this unique event (a ?dirty? Disney film).<br>The whole scale of the conversation is in inverse proportion to the actual smuttiness.<br>In a superb irony, one poster to a Disney newsgroup has alerted everyone to the existence of a Web page where pictures of the two offending frames are shown. One minute at Swanbourne Beach would put what is on show in the shade.<br>Other posters have signalled the existence of dubious sites which purport to show several instances of pornography in Disney animations.<br>Needless to say these sites require registration and payment because they are porn sites themselves.<br>The whole episode helps to confirm the commonly-held prejudice of computer programmers: the software and hardware are not the problem - it is the meatware (or people) in between.<br>Helpdesk<br>DejaNews:<br>www.dejanews.com<br>American Life League:<br>www.all.org<br>Disney:<br>disney.go.com<br></font></p>
