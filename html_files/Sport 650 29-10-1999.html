            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHOSE side is God on anyway? Throughout history countless leaders have invoked his name when charging into battle. The Crusaders and the Conquistadors come readily to mind as examples of warriors who believed God was on their side.<br>It's not always a case of the Christian God having it to himself, of course. Former US president George Bush, like nearly every president before him, put God on the side of American soldiers in the 1991 Gulf War. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was equally as convinced that his forces had their God on side against the Great Satan of the US and its allies.<br>The question has taxed great minds over time. In the 16th century, Martin Luther wrote a hymn called If God Had Not Been On Our Side, which appeared in the Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal.<br>In it he warned that, ?If God had not been on our side, And had not come to aid us, The foes with all their power and pride, Would surely have dismayed us?.<br>Whereas in 1963, Bob Dylan wrote the song, With God On Our Side, for a far more cynical and battle-weary audience. Dylan concluded: ?The confusion I'm feelin', Ain't no tongue can tell, The words fill my head, And fall to the floor, If God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.?<br>A more even-handed approach might be found in the words Irish comedian Dave Allen used to sign off from his show many years ago. After an hour spent taking the mickey out of every established religion, Allen used to say to his audience: ?May your God go with you.?<br>I bet you could spend hours, even days, in heated argument about whether God is on the side of republicans or constitutional monarchists. But it's nothing as heavy as the republic referendum or war that makes me ask the question about God. It's to do with the world of sport.<br>After South Africa's red-headed fly half Jannie De Beer drop-kicked England out of the rugby union World Cup last Sunday with a record five field goals, he put the victory and his inspirational performance down to God. ?God gave us victory today - it had to be part of his game plan,? said the 28-year-old, who claimed he has thrown himself into religion since seeing the light six years ago.<br>?I believe in my heart it wasn't just the players, there was a hand watching over us. I just want to give God all the glory because he gave us all our talents. I'm just happy to have been given the opportunity to show what we can do. Some things that happened out there I just don't have answers for,? De Beer continued.<br>It's both an enlightening and frightening admission from De Beer, and yet another example of South African sporting spirituality. When the country won the last World Cup in 1995, then captain Francois Pienaar took his players aside straight after the final whistle. They all knelt and said a prayer of thanks.<br>The victory of De Beer's God-driven Springboks probably was all the better because it was against a team whose fans are not backward in bandying around a bit of religious fervour during games, either.<br>The English crowds give full voice to the old negro spiritual Swing Low, Sweet Chariot to urge their boys to greater feats.<br>However, having seen local football club members render this hymn with special arm and body movements during drunken gentlemen's evenings, I can only surmise that its power lacks the sort of spirituality that De Beer was talking about.<br>The crux of the matter is that these Springboks will play Australia tomorrow night in the cup semi-final. And I fear our Wallabies might be a Godless bunch.<br>So whose side will God be on? The answer is obvious - God only knows.watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
