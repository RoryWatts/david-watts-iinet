            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I VAGUELY remember a history lesson meant to illustrate the enormity of time, the universe, life ... everything really.<br>It went like this:<br>Imagine that the height of the Eiffel Tower represents the time that the planet Earth has been around.<br>Now imagine a postage stamp stuck on top of the tower. The height of that stamp represents the time that man has been around.<br>And the height of the glue holding that postage stamp on top of the Eiffel Tower represents the time in which man has recorded history.<br>This set of comparisons might also apply to the history of the Internet.<br>The height of the Eiffel Tower could represent the time of recorded history; the height of the stamp the time of computers, and the glue the time of the Net.<br>Let's just look at the Net. Only four years ago, the biggest thrill was to upload a Web page in which the user had included text that blinked.<br>By using the HTML parameters <BLINK> and </BLINK> you could make your text wink on and off ... and off and on and on and off and so on.<br>This phenomenon of Web design lasted about five minutes.<br>Now people are finding truly useful things that the medium can help them with.<br>One is lightning-fast football barracking. Carlton shocked nearly everyone when it beat Essendon in Saturday's AFL preliminary final.<br>Within 30 minutes of the end of the one-point game, footy fans were offering their heartfelt commiserations to Bomber supporters at the Bomber Talk page of Essendon's Web site.<br>We can't reprint many of these messages of condolence because this is a family newspaper.<br>But one non-swearing example that probably summed up the tenor went like this: ?HaaaHaaaaHaaaaHaaaaHaaaaHaaaa ...?<br>On a more serious note, the National Australia Bank last week appeared to pioneer a new phase in Australian Net use.<br>It announced that customers who wanted to bank online could have ?free? Net access with the FreeOnline ISP.<br>The quotes around the word free are there because although FreeOnline is touted as the country's first free ISP, there are enough strings attached to prove the tired, old saying, ?there is no such thing as a free lunch?.<br>For a start, NAB online bankers in WA can't get excited because FreeOnline is purely a Sydney-Melbourne operation at the moment. Perth and other centres are expected to come into play next year.<br>FreeOnline offers 75 hours surfing a month for no charge. But this is a complicated 75 hours. It's not a matter of connecting and going for it until the clock runs down.<br>FREEONLINE offers virtually unlimited access to a set number of sites which it calls the FreeZone. If you stray out of that zone - which includes some of Australia's most popular sites - you have to be very time-conscious.<br>Your ?free? Net access will start to cost you if you linger longer than 15 minutes between 8am and 11pm, or two hours between 11pm and 8am.<br>But the very fact that such a big business as the NAB has been able to offer an incentive to get online ?free? shows there is a lot of territory for other businesses to tie their online ventures to ISPs.<br>The result may be a restricted version of the Net, based on customer loyalty.<br>But e-commerce could be stimulated with a broader online population.<br></font></p>
