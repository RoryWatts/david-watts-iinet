            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE of the few dead certainties in football is that the game is now being bred for the couch potato.<br>The development of Subiaco Oval as a 43,500 all-seat stadium, announced last week, simply confirms that.<br>It means in two or three years most home-and-away games will be played at sold-out, so-called boutique venues - Subiaco, Football Park, the new Docklands and the SCG most prominently - and telecast live.<br>It is a good time to focus on what Channel 7 can do to improve its heavy and mostly good coverage.<br>As the great C.P. Scott said when editor of the old Manchester Guardian: ?Opinions are free, but facts are sacred.?<br>These are opinions. Feel free to send your own to the addresses at the end of the column.<br>1: CONTINUE to try to unearth new commentators. Another weekend, the same old voices ... it's not quite true, but sometimes it feels like it.<br>Experiments this year with Paul Couch, Neil Brooks and Graham Cornes need more work.<br>2: CUT the size of the commentary box. We do not need a host, a main caller, a back-up, an analyst, a boundary rider and a fourth umpire.<br>A main caller, an offsider-analyst and a boundary man would cut the incessant chatter and direct more attention to the vital ingredient of football ... the game.<br>3: GET rid of the fourth umpire. Who watches football to hear about the umpires? John Russo's nattering about being baffled by both decisions and non-decisions took a lot of pleasure out of watching Essendon steal the game from Carlton on Sunday.<br>4: MAKE the boundary riders neutral. It is time Neil Kerley was sent to a non-Adelaide match. Ditto for Adrian Barich and the Eagles or Dockers.<br>Little seems to be gained by blatant one-sided opinion. There is plenty of that in the living room already. Leave something for the fans, please.<br>5: GO easy on the ads. Do we really need advertisements after every other goal and in batches of five or six at the breaks?<br>Virtual advertising may be the way to go if the details can be tied up with the likes of the Melbourne Cricket Club.<br>A good half-time show like the ABC's Half-Time at the Footy during Westar Rules coverage would be preferable to what Seven offers.<br>6: BE judicious with replays. Slow-motion replays can enhance the drama and help explain what really happened in the heat of the moment.<br>But when they interrupt live coverage, they are a pain.<br>7: SEVEN should not try to compete with Sam Newman. There is only one Footy Show, and even if it was below par last week - perhaps there is a home ground advantage - Live and Kicking cannot measure up to the ad-libs, profanity and occasional genuine hard footy news that Nine's offering delivers.<br>?Send your opinions via e-mail to watto@iinet.net.au, or David Watts, The West Australian, 50 Hasler Drive, Osborne Park.<br></font></p>
