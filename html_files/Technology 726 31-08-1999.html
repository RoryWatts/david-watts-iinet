            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALL Allan Cooke wanted to do was sell second-hand computers to help make the world a better place. Instead, a con man nearly derailed his Kids Talk project before it entered its latest, ambitious stage.<br>Mr Cooke, an inventor and ideas man from Banjup, estimates the con job cost his project about $10,000.<br>And it looked like disrupting the opening of his second-hand computer shop in High Street, Fremantle.<br>But the Kids Talk shop is back on track with a lot of help from TAFE and community donations.<br>Kids Talk, set up earlier this year, began taking donations of unwanted computers from WA schools in March so they could be given new life and sent to technology-starved children in Russia and other less-wired countries.<br>The project has been successful enough for Mr Cooke to open the port shop so that money can be raised by the sale of old computers and gear.<br>A key to setting up the shop was to find a technician who could refurbish the old gear for sale to the public.<br>Mr Cooke said a man who claimed he was a computer technician from Sydney asked him for this vital role.<br>?Being a trusting person and having more faith in human nature than most people, I gave him a go,? Mr Cooke said. ?After a week in which he had been given money to buy parts and other expenses he did a bunk, taking with him some computers and printers. And worse he stripped the computers of their RAM drive leaving us with nothing to sell until we re-serviced them and renewed the parts.<br>?He also took our registered software for DOS and Microsoft.?<br>Police are trying to trace the man.<br>Mr Cooke said TAFE had come to the rescue and provided him with skilled technicians.<br>The Kids Talk shop, meanwhile, is doing well, according to Mr Cooke, attracting customers and an increasing number of inquiries.<br>Four technicians check out donated old computers and put new life into them. On sale are Apple Macs with no hard drive, IBM 286s, 386s, 486s and even Pentiums. Some computers are ideal for simply playing games on, and there are even rejuvenated printers on the shelves.<br>Mr Cooke hopes to have an in-house Net service operating by the end of September which would allow the passing public to use e-mail and surf the Web for $12 an hour.<br>Profits from the shop's operations are destined to help Kids Talk, a charity organisation, send computers to Third World countries.<br>Mr Cooke said Kids Talk aimed to make the world a better place.<br>?The Internet is changing things more than most people realise. It has the potential to give us the freedom humanity must have if we are to develop into true spiritual beings,? he said.<br>?We intend to talk to our brothers and sisters around the world via the Internet using cyberspace as our domain to make things better.?<br></font></p>
