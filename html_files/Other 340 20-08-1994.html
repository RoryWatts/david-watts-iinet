            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Winter's bracing weather drives the holidaymakers home from Margaret River but the region's varied attractions stay open, uncluttered and enjoyable, as<br>CHRISTINE WALSH and DAVID WATTS found on a recent weekend break.<br>IN WINTER Margaret River snoozes in the rain. Ankle-deep in mud, it squelches its way through the off-season, waiting anxiously for the surfers, day-trippers, cavers, eaters and drinkers to return.<br>What can you do with a family when the wind is starting to blow hard and buckets of rain threaten from black skies?<br>Quite a lot actually.<br>Margaret River might be an ideal base for summery families with boogie boards, fishing rods and sunburn cream, but it is not too bad either for the rugged-up brigade in parkas and wellies.<br>All those things that families delight in doing during spring, summer and early autumn are there in winter, too. It just takes a bit more get up and go to get up and get at them.<br>We took our small brood, an eight-year-old girl and five-year-old-boy, down there in the middle of a raging July rainstorm fearful they would be forced to look at four walls and a television the whole weekend.<br>But why worry? Even without a hint of sun or warmth, kids bloom like spring flowers at the sight of open air, green grass and the fresh smell of the South-West.<br>First stop was the Bannamah Wildlife Park, 2km south of Dunsborough and set in an 8ha natural bush valley. The park is a comfortable 30-minute drive along Caves Road past the more adult attractions of wineries and weekend-away lodges.<br>Bannamah gets its best crowds in summer but the wide variety of animals is just the same in winter and equally worth a look. Management will even lend a colourful umbrella or two if the rain is pouring.<br>The difference between summer and winter viewing of the wildlife, which varies from crocodiles and snakes to a free range troop of kangaroos and several gaggles of geese, is that winter viewing is far more peaceful.<br>The crowds are down and the animals more sleepy. This drop in excitability makes peaceful petting of some select red kangaroos a calm experience for a child. Bags of feed for $1 are a great idea for children who like to commune with nature.<br>Bannamah's other attractions are fast growing in popularity too. A restaurant, with wide views of the park and log fires, serves seriously pleasant food that burdens neither the stomach nor the wallet.<br>And the impressive range of often starkly beautiful furniture from Indonesia and Mexico should not be missed. If you cannot afford the pieces it does not hurt to look, touch and dream a little.<br>Next door to Bannamah is a fun place for children (and not that bad for city adults either). John O'Sullivan's Country Life Farm is all personable fun and homespun philosophy.<br>He gives hayrides with the help of a chugging red tractor, boat rides on a dinky little dam and tame cuddly animals - from guinea pigs to an alpaca (called Al) - spring from every nook. Even more - including Ali the llama - come out of the crannies.<br>It is one of the South-West's tourist attractions that should be a must for families, combining a real farm feel with fun and total relaxation.<br>Finding a place to feed the family in this part of WA is a problem only because of the superabundance of choice. Luxury restaurants, good cafes, winery annexes, homely eateries ... the Margaret River area has them all.<br>We fed the family on huge portions of calamari and chips at Eats Diner, right in the middle of Margaret River. There was enough food for twice the number of people, prices were cheap and the slightly up-market fish and chip shop atmosphere made the kids feel right at home. One portion of fish and chips would have been ample for the children to share.<br>To combine education, fun and fine eating, our next stop - the Margaret River Marron Farm - was hard to beat.<br>About 5km south of Margaret River, on Bussell Highway, is the turn-off to the Wickham Road site of a brave experiment in producing a genuine WA delicacy. Life has not always been easy, particularly during the recession, but the fruits of many labours are now growing as quickly as the thousands of delicious marron in the 47 ponds.<br>Farm owner Malcolm Gould turns over 8-10 tonnes of marron a year - many of them are sold at the farm cafe and more and more are ending up on Perth plates.<br>Sue Prater, owner of the tourist and restaurant complex, has big plans for her business. Come next month there will be a revamp of facilities; a better educational area, a trout fishing farm and an improved park and picnic area.<br>Winter may not bring big crowds to the farm - five times more people visit in summer - but it is the best time to eat marron.<br>And Sue Prater's country-style restaurant knows how to serve them. We had a platter - for $40 - which offered 9-10 marron a head and what seemed like a garden of gourmet salad, with local feta, marinated eggplant and olives.<br>Before eating marron it is not a bad idea to know your delicacy, figuratively. The tourist complex has a basic ?tape? tour (to be modernised) which gives the facts, while you learn the difference between a marron and a yabbie.<br>And did you know a female marron breeds once a year and can have 250-300 young ones? Or marron are the only freshwater crustacea that do not burrow. They need constant running water to survive. It is also native only to the South-West ... and so delicious.<br>If the region's motels and hotels are a bit out of your family's price range, you might consider the budget-style accommodation we used at Boodjidup Lodge. Clean, casual and comfortable, it is just right for a relaxed break and within walking distance of Margaret River in this green and pleasant land.<br></font></p>
