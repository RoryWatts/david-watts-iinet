            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE of the most boring parts of modern life is the lift, or elevator if you prefer the Americanisation of the language.<br>Lifts play central parts in many films. Heroes often clamber on top of them as they plummet earthwards. Blackouts happen only when the required number of actors have piled in, ensuring conflict and tension while they await help (which can come from a hero clambering on top).<br>Occasionally lifts are used as love nests, as in Fatal Attraction, where the hero and his lady pop their buttons and other things while going up . . . or down . . . or perhaps up and down.<br>The only couple I know who tried to make love in a lift were sorely disappointed because it had only four floors to travel. As a result they had both popped just one button when the doors opened on to the ground floor reception area where they were confronted by a dozen or so people waiting for a less exciting ride.<br>The reason lifts have become such dramatic centrepieces is to mask the fact that in real life nothing much happens in them. You might have noticed such dramatic licence is also taken with planes, trains and buses; which considering their frequency of use lead pretty sober-sided lives no more exciting than a Sunday picnic.<br>Actually escalators, or moving staircases if you prefer the British terminology, are far more adventurous in real life. There is always the risk of getting your foot stuck as the stair is swallowed at either end. And you can be a thrill seeker and go up the down-escalator, or vice versa.<br>You cannot do that in a lift unless you push the wrong button.<br>I have known only one person who regularly bucked the accepted lift tradition of standing still and staring at the numbers as they flash for the floors (what else would they do . . . explode or change into mystic rhunes).<br>This young man used to stand in the back corner looking at the wall and would sing the American national anthem loudly. If he rode a lift in a tall building he became a little flummoxed because he did not know all the verses.<br>He was a South Australian, so that may explain things.<br>The rest of us do not have to follow his example but a correspondent named Robynne recently gave me permission to pass on a list of interesting things to do in otherwise uninteresting lifts. She had 50 of them, but I will pass only the 20 that are publishable in a family newspaper:<br>1. Make race car noises when anyone gets on or off.<br>2. Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering: ?Shut up, all of you just shut UP.?<br>3. Whistle the first seven notes of It's a Small World incessantly.<br>4. Shave.<br>5. Greet everyone getting on with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral.<br>6. Stare and grin at another passenger for a while, and then announce: "I've got new socks on.?<br>7. Miaow occasionally.<br>8. Sing Mary Had a Little Lamb while continually pushing buttons.<br>9. Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce ?You're one of THEM? and move to the far corner.<br>10. Start a sing-along.<br>11. Play the harmonica.<br>12. Say ?Ding? at each floor.<br>13. Listen to the walls with a stethoscope.<br>14. Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers that this is your personal space.<br>15. Take a bite of a sandwich and ask another passenger: ?Wanna see wha in muh mouf??<br>16. Bring in a chair to sit on.<br>17. Announce in a demonic voice: ?I must find a more suitable host body.?<br>18. Carry a blanket and clutch it protectively.<br>19. Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button.<br>20. Stare at your thumb and say ?I think it's getting larger.?<br>Next week we will have a look at funny things that doctors say.<br></font></p>
