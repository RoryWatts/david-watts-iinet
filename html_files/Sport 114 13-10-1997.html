            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HAVE we seen the end of Kieren Perkins ... and will we ever see the end of Sam Newman?<br>Channel 9 had the spotlight on both last week in vastly different ways. Perkins, as always, was centre stage at the Australian Open Swimming championships in Brisbane. Nine had nice, tight highlight packages late each night.<br>Former champions Nicole Stevenson and Duncan Armstrong provided good expert backup to seasoned caller Mike McCann.<br>The eccentric highlight was Laurie Lawrence, the ebullient ex-coach of many big names, striding up and down poolside beside the racers as a sort of wet boundary rider.<br>Lawrence was usually spot-on about how the swimmers were coping. For example, he could see Susie O'Neill ?going up and down on the spot? as she slowed down at the end of her 200m butterfly win.<br>And he could see and pass on the subtle change in Grant Hackett's stroke as Daniel Kowalski challenged him early in his big 1500m victory.<br>It was that 1500m where we saw the demise of Perkins, a distant third to Hackett and Kowalski.<br>It was such a far cry from the stirring gold medal at Atlanta last year when the written-off face of Australian swimming showed the true grit of a champion.<br>Perkins was a slow qualifier again at these championships. The expectation was that he would do an Atlanta. The reality was that it was all too much.<br>Perhaps, the burden of shouldering our swimming hopes and the constant high profile he has because of his many sponsorships finally overpowered him.<br>And maybe it is time to let Perkins enjoy time in the shade, admitting he cannot win every race.<br>Time then to celebrate and enjoy the rise of new blood like Hackett, world record breaker Michael Klim and awesome 14-year-old Ian Thorpe.<br>Nine had past and present champions in a very different guise on Thursday night in the Footy Show's New Faces.<br>Once upon a time footballers put on drunken review shows for long-suffering mates, wives and girlfriends in the back rooms of pubs. Thanks to Nine's love of making footballers into personalities, the whole nation can now suffer their boneheaded antics.<br>Sam Newman, Eddie McGuire and their rugby league counterparts Paul Vautin and Peter Sterling hosted the show featuring acts - a very loose description - from teams from the AFL, ARL, rugby union and soccer.<br>Newman - omnipresent this year with his broken nose and run-in with a girlfriend's car - seemed to cap off a rotten year when he gave the ARL's rotten act zero.<br>Two giants raced over - a third slipped in a beer puddle on the stage - and tackled Newman ferociously. It was something non-Melbourne footy fans have dreamt of all year.<br>Nine had the chance to let viewers work out whether Mark Taylor's future was still on a knife-edge yesterday. However, the network decided to cut into the Queensland-NSW one-dayer and show the Japan Formula One Grand Prix from Suzuka.<br>It was a thriller, but the cricket had a host of more important issues than the F1 boys.<br></font></p>
