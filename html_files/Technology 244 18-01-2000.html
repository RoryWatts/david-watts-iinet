            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALL those reports that the Y2K bug was a fizzer are not quite that accurate.<br>This column has had a few weeks off but saw startling evidence of the bug in action on New Year's Eve. In the dying hours of last year a paltry 15,000 turned up to see Carlton slaughter our old WA hero Mick Malthouse's Collingwood.<br>Magpie president Eddie McGuire had tipped a 90,000 crowd but even he forsook the MCG for the flashier delights of the Sydney 2000 fireworks.<br>Rumour has it that Microsoft chairman Bill Gates watched the Sydney spectacular too, thus probably ensuring a bug-free telecast for Channel 9 against Seven's blighted out-of-season football.<br>It is all very ancient history but the suspicion must be that as far as sport for armchair fans goes, the Y2K bug is alive and well.<br>For a start, Lleyton Hewitt has become almost likable. You have to say almost because he called his home crowd at Adelaide stupid, then won the tournament plus the adidas International at the weekend.<br>This puts him in the almost bizarre position of world No.1 so we one-eyed Aussie fans - stupid as we might be - can take him to our hearts and note the fist-pumping and self-glorification has dropped off a little.<br>The Y2K bug also seems to be eating our Davis Cup hero Mark Philippoussis.<br>The toast of the nation just on a month ago has had two dramatic, sudden injury withdrawals, first from the Hopman Cup, then the Kooyong Classic on Saturday night.<br>Something is not right with the world.<br>All last year the pundits put this sort of erraticism down to Y2K. Why not now?<br>Mention of Hewitt and Philippoussis conjures up another manifestation of the bug -- Seven's never-ending tennis telecasts.<br>Hard core fans might find this hard to take, but surely there is a bit much of the game even for diehards. A week of the adidas from Sydney reintroduced the smarmy tones of Garry Wilkinson, the nasal familiarity of Pam Shriver, the thoughtful musings of Liz Smylie and the tennis trademark sounds of John Alexander and John Fitzgerald. Great for a short time if you wanted wisdoms such as: ?(Sandon) Stolle and Hewitt will be ruing those missed opportunities.?<br>Tennis commentary tends to bring out the bleeding obvious in the best of them.<br>Now they are in our lounge rooms for two weeks. We will have every chance to see an unheralded Bolivian down an unknown Belgian all to the excited backdrop of Bruce McAvaney.<br>It's summer though and there is not much else to do is there? Just swimming, surfing, barbecuing, bushwalking, holidaying, keeping cool and generally having a good time.<br>Pity about this resurgent Y2K bug though. The most worrying evidence of it was in the Internet edition of the Melbourne Age yesterday.<br>It was a picture of Nathan Buckley next to a beaming Martina Hingis. And she was wearing a Collingwood jumper.<br>Talk about putting the mockers on someone .<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
