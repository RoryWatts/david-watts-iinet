            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A SURE way to nod off to sleep in seconds is to watch the ABC late on Monday nights.<br>After the mad flurry of English Premier League soccer comes Australian baseball.<br>With a backdrop of tiny crowds and never-ending statistics, the ABC boys try to drum up enthusiasm for a game that bores most Australians as much as cricket does Americans.<br>Pity the ABC. Twenty years ago it was the spiritual home of cricket, football (who could forget The Winners?), tennis and golf.<br>The most common viewer complaint was of having a Dennis Lillee over cut short from the MCG so a Johan Kriek volley at Kooyong could be replayed.<br>The national broadcaster had it all, and nearly always live, and certainly always uninterrupted. Life seemed simpler and sport purer.<br>But cricket went to Channel 9 and an advertisement an over as well as Richie Benaud trying to flog $150 photo montages.<br>Footy went to Seven with an advertisement every second goal and Sandy Roberts trying to make ?good morning? sound like exciting news about Tony Lockett's groin.<br>Tennis split itself between Seven and Nine, except for Perth's Hopman Cup which went to Auntie.<br>The national carrier is way behind the commercials. Now Channel 10, the baby of the broadcasters, has had the impudence to cast off a major sport, the National Basketball League, because it can't get the ratings.<br>And just like a flathead prowling the depths for a morsel, the ABC has grabbed the bait and decided to telecast NBL games live on Sunday evenings from February.<br>Auntie, once the purveyor of sport so Australian you could almost smell the meat pies, will be the carrier of a game so American you can just taste the Big Macs.<br>It seems a funny partnership, but the ABC has brought a mostly disinterested country the Women's NBL for some time now. And its coverage isn't bad. It certainly lacks the hysteria associated with Ten's NBL cover. If you search memory banks far enough you'll find the ABC throwing itself into Melbourne matches in the 1970s, accompanied by the gruff tones of Doug Mason.<br>Also, it is hard to forget Don Lane's enthusiastic presentation of American football. It has lost a bit of its novelty value since it went to Nine last year.<br>Then there's the baseball, which seems a duty rather than a pleasure.<br>That very Australian bloke, Neville Oliver, head of ABC Sport, was quoted last Friday as saying his network was desperate to get back into mainstream sport. He believed live basketball was a product that would work.<br>The Sunday afternoon slot of 4pm is thought to be a winner.<br>One hopes Oliver himself won't be moved to call the NBL games. You could just imagine: ?This is a disgrace listeners. They're playing intolerably loud rock music while these boys are trying to play sport.<br>?Every couple of minutes they stop them playing altogether and bring on dancing girls, would you believe ladies and gentlemen. I think I'd rather be watching the louts in the outer at the SCG than listening to this cacophony.?<br></font></p>
