            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FRIEND who is old enough to know better told me two jokes last week. Their ?shaggy dog? nature tickled my fancy; so I am going to burden readers with both.<br>I will not name the friend for fear of embarrassing him. However, he lives in Daglish, not far from the sewerage works and claims his torpedo punts are second only to Peter Matera's.<br>Joke one: Quasimodo, the hunchback, grew tired of his job ringing the bells at Notre Dame. He asked the bishop to find a replacement.<br>The bishop, sad to see the back of Quasi, reluctantly agreed on the condition Quasi taught his replacement the art of bell-ringing, so the cathedral's fame would not suffer.<br>A likely replacement was found and accompanied Quasi to the bell tower. ?This is how you do it,? Quasi instructed the novice. ?On the hour you have to pull this big bell way back, then push.<br>?When it swings back, give it another really big push. The third time it comes back, give it a huge heave-ho and it will start ringing. Look it's 11 o'clock now, why not give it a go.?<br>The novice agreed and pulled the bell back once and pushed it with all his might like a pro. Same for the second push.<br>But on the third he pushed too hard and the bell swung too far and hit him in the head, bowling him clear out of the tower and 150m to the square below.<br>Quasi was horrified. He ran down as fast as his legs would carry him. A big crowd had gathered around the flattened man.<br>?Do you know this man?? one of the gaping crowd asked Quasi.<br>?No, but the face rings a bell.?<br>Joke two: An elderly and lonely woman was walking her dog. He was sniffing flowers by the gutter, but, alas, was on the road when a car swung round the corner and flattened him.<br>The driver was mortified. He hopped out, but found the dog was dead. He apologised to the owner and offered to bury the dog.<br>?My dog can't be dead,? she said in a glazed way, ?he's all I have. We must get him to the vet and fix him up.?<br>Vainly protesting that the dog had gone to his maker, the driver reluctantly agreed. At the vet's he slunk off red-faced while the owner spoke. ?My dog needs help, he's been run over,? the owner told the perplexed but compassionate vet.<br>?He's dead,? said the vet. But the owner would not be moved. She demanded he use all his resources to revive the beloved pet.<br>Like the driver, the vet agreed reluctantly. He shot an injection of adrenalin straight into the hound's heart ... nothing.<br>He applied electric shocks ... again nothing.<br>He brought in a cat which was undergoing minor treatment. He threw the cat on top of the dog. It arched its back, stuck out its claws and spat ... not a sausage from the dead dog.<br>The woman now believed her dog was departed. ?What do I owe you?? she asked.<br>?That'll be $440,? the vet replied. ?$440! What ever for,? the woman retorted.<br>?Well, it's $20 for the adrenalin, $20 for the electric shock treatment ... and $400 for the cat scan.?<br>???<br>A FEW weeks ago I raised the spectre of questions without obvious answers - they have been muddying the path towards finding the meaning of life.<br>One question was ?why is a duck??. This brain number is attributed to Groucho Marx. Some Perth people claim they know the answer.<br>With surprising agreement, all correspondents who have written on this matter have supplied similar answers.<br>And it is: Because the other leg is both the same. A slight variation, but still in the same vein is: One of its legs are both the same.<br>???<br>NEWS FLUSH: A friend of a friend says that auto-flush loos for women do exist, ruining my theories about such contraptions. She found one in Singapore, not surprisingly. The island State is obsessed with cleanliness.<br>It also has the biggest no-smoking sign I've seen. In the ferry terminal, people waiting to go to Sentosa are confronted by words nearly two metres high, saying ?NO SMOKING. Penalty $5000?.<br></font></p>
