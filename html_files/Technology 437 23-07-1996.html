            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">EVERYWHERE you surf these days someone is claiming to have the definitive cool or hot list ... the most frequently visited sites on the World Wide Web.<br>Top search engines like Webcrawler, Lycos and Australia's Web Wombat have collections of top sites as do the compilers of best-of sites like Point and AAA Cool Site.<br>All the lists vary and most are collected in different ways. Some simply collect statistics like a Web counter, which can be biased to pages that are loaded as a home page and register a hit every time a user starts their browser.<br>Many, like AAA, depend on people submitting their sites and really have no way of knowing what is being entered as a cool site.<br>One of the latest claimants to the definitive list of hot sites is called the 100hot Web Sites. It is an American site and, like all other gatherers of hits, says it has the unique counter.<br>It also has a unique disposition with adult sex sites ... it disposes of them so they do not win a guernsey in the rankings. Obviously the 100hot is not a true representation of the most visited sites on the Web, but it is a selfregulated one, appropriate for families.<br>Also dispensed with are personal home pages and US college sites which the 100hot webmaster terms uninteresting. This is itself an interesting remark because the Web's diversity and occasional eccentricity is largely to be found among individuals rather than corporations.<br>So we are left with 100 hot mostly business-related or commercial sites which actually include some reasonably warm, if not actually torrid, content.<br>The 100hot works out ranking by first looking at the most requested categories on search engines. It then analyses Web sites in those categories, first making estimates of Web traffic at ?key sites on the Internet?, whatever that means.<br>But the more reliable indicator appears to be the webmaster's plea for sites which register more than 20,000 hits to contact 100hot.<br>Sounds familiar. It is just like submitting your site, only in this case the 100hot is looking only for the big boys.<br>And the biggest of the big is Netscape, followed by Yahoo then Pointcast, Microsoft and America Online.<br>Although the 100hot does not include adult sites, it notes that the biggest category searched on the Web is model/celebrity - which does not always fall into the torrid zone - followed by best-of sites (like the 100hot), games and showbusiness.<br>The 100hot has also ranked the top 100 applications sought on the Web and found that animated GIFs are all the rage, followed by HTML coding and JPEG image encoding.<br>URL: www.100hot.com/<br></font></p>
