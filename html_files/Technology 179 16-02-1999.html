But Norton 2000 from Symantec is more thorough and easy to follow than many.<br>Symantec makes bespoke products like Norton Utilities and has the reputation of being the world leader in utility software.<br>It has to be pointed out firmly that Norton 2000 cannot fix the millennium bug. But it can uncover danger areas on a system or network that may require more investigation and even remedial action.<br>Norton 2000 scans data, applications and hardware and alerts the user to non-compliance problems.<br>It is then up to users to determine whether the faults pointed out by Norton will cause serious problems.<br>Ross Wilson, Symantec's regional director for South-East Asia, said Norton 2000 addressed hardware and software Year 2000 issues on computers, providing users with a safe and reliable way to help their transition into the new millennium.<br>A big strength of Norton 2000 is its interrogation of spreadsheets and databases.<br>These sorts of files raise serious issues when dates in them fall close to a ?cusp? point. Excel version 4, 5 and 7 assume that year values from 00 to 19 represent 2000-2019 and year values from 20-99 represent 1920-1999.<br>Excel 8 extends this cusp point to 29/30. As a result, dates in a spreadsheet with years close to these cusp points may be incorrectly interpreted.<br>Norton 2000 includes a data scanning component that not only discovers Y2K problems in these complex files, but also generates a report detailing findings.<br>For recent Excel spreadsheets, Norton 2000 colour-codes and annotates the spreadsheet to highlight and explain Y2K issues in each affected cell. It also audits other popular software applications for year 2000 compliance and compares those applications against a database of known 2000 problems.<br>The application database is kept up-to-date using LiveUpdate, a utility program that locates and helps install hardware drivers and software updates.<br>Norton 2000 uses a boot floppy to test and fix system clocks and the BIOS, where possible, thereby preventing users from inadvertently destroying data and program configurations during testing.<br>For Windows 95, 98, NT 3.51 or higher. 16Mb of RAM and 10Mb of disk space needed. A 5.5Mb online version can be downloaded at:<br>www.symantec.com.au/region/reg_ap/<br>product/norton2000/fs_n2k<br></font></p>
