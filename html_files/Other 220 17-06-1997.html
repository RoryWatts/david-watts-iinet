            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Superman actor Christopher Reeve is truly a man of steel.<br>The 44-year-old was cut down in a tragic riding accident two years ago. He is crippled and wheelchair-bound.<br>But he works non-stop, not only back in his old field of film-making, but most prominently as a strong, clear voice for others in the world immobilised by paralysis.<br>Reeve's fight is now on the Web at the Circle of Friends, a strikingly designed site which is part of the American Paralysis Association's campaign to find a cure for spinal cord injury.<br>Reeve's striking face is central to the thrust of the opening page of the site, which boasts a unique design feature - it is about 3000 pixels wide. Most computer screens are only 800 wide, so you do not get the whole story unless you use the bottom scroll bar.<br>The aims of the site and the support of a galaxy of Hollywood stars, including Tom Hanks and Mel Gibson, are then spelt out.<br>The method in this apparent madness is to give surfers a feeling of the perspective endured by paralysis victims.<br>?People with spinal cord injuries spend the day in a wheelchair. Their perspective is confined to a horizontal plane,? the site explains.<br>?This home page scrolls on a horizontal plane as a subtle reminder of how people with spinal cord injury live everyday.<br>?This home page will remain horizontal until research finds a cure and people with spinal cord injury can rise to the occasion.?<br></font></p>
