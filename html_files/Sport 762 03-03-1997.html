            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WAR can be such a bore. Super League came to TV on Saturday night amid marketing hype not seen since the days of World Series Cricket.<br>At the heart of the saturation campaign was an ad which had several boofy blokes in shorts tearing madly through constantly changing domestic scenes.<br>The loud musical accompaniment was the Frankie Goes to Hollywood hit of several years ago, When Two Tribes Go to War.<br>All this and close to unquestioning coverage from 70 per cent of Australia's newspapers - which just happen to be owned by Rupert Murdoch, the tycoon who decided rugby league was just the thing to boost ratings on his TV networks round the world.<br>And the result: a scrappy, uninteresting match between Brisbane and Auckland that left the 42,000 crowd at Brisbane's ANZ stadium muttering with boredom and disinterest.<br>A media mogul like Mr Murdoch might control a competition but he can never control the game.<br>That is the preserve of the players and the conditions.<br>Auckland looked disinterested and uncoordinated like a team of individuals who'd just been introduced and told they had to put on a show against Super League's hottest prophets.<br>The Brisbane Broncos did just enough to ensure their 14-2 was a comfortable win.<br>There were complaints that the ball was slippery and conditions humid, though not a million miles away the ACT beat Queensland in the Super 12s rugby union match at Ballymore.<br>Queensland skipper Tim Horan told Channel 7 yesterday conditions were ideal and the ball was never slippery.<br>Super League at ANZ appeared to have everything.<br>There were the hottest rock acts, Yothu Yindhi and Belinda Carlisle, the hottest fireworks, and the hottest rivalry - an Australian team and a NZ team.<br>So what was the lasting impression from this hot new would-be star of television sport?<br>The never-ending nagging of referee Bill Harrigan.<br>Some genius thought it would be a good idea to have the referee wired for sound so TV viewers could hear his every breath.<br>The whole purpose of refereeing is to be as inconspicuous as possible.<br>The crowd and TV viewers want to watch sport being played, not hear the priceless words of officialdom.<br>The referee's microphone dominated all other sound.<br>The biggish crowd (stadium capacity is 50,000; so it was the equivalent of about 30,000 at Subiaco) was hard to hear.<br>Commentators Warren Boland and Wally Lewis had most of their words overshadowed by the continual ?get off him; back, back; that's four?, and they did not sound impressed.<br>Even after the lacklustre game, the fireworks were dragged out again.<br>The noise seemed to startle Buck the horse which parades around on behalf of the Broncos.<br>He high-stepped like a dressage entrant.<br>His rider dropped his Broncos flag, then lost his Akubra, then appeared to lose his cool.<br>Far better TV value was Channel 7's impressive line-up of Fremantle proving far too good for a nervous-looking Port Power in the Ansett Cup; the Super 12s rugby union thriller between Waikato and Wellington; the Three Tenors from LA; and the two Matts (Elliott and Hayden) from Johannesburg in the absorbing if horribly delayed first Test.<br></font></p>
