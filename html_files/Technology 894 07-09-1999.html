            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AWARDS<br>Australian Internet Awards<br>www.webawards.com.au<br>THE Web community cannot get enough of Sausage Software, judging by the results of the recent Australian Internet Awards.<br>Sausage, best known for the Hot Dog HTML editor, won the award for most popular Australian site for the second successive year.<br>It beat snow report site ski.com.au and picture library site sweet.com. The most popular gong is a publicly voted category. All others are judged by a panel after nominations from the public.<br>Eighteen categories were open this year and more than 13,000 people voted for the most popular. Organisers from the Australian Financial Review and Telstra reported an 80 per cent increase in nominations and a 60 per cent jump in votes with surfers from the UK, US, Japan and Singapore joining in.<br>All the winners and nominees can be reached easily from the awards site.<br>LANGUAGE<br>Daily Grammar<br>www.dailygrammar.com<br>A Word a Day<br>www.wordsmith.org/awad<br>FREE grammar lessons are provided at Daily Grammar by an American English teacher who e-mails out a brief lesson five days a week. At the end of the week, he sends out a quiz on all you've learnt.<br>Alternatively, you can go to the Word a Day site to receive a word and its definition every day.<br>LEISURE<br>Motorcycle News<br>mcnews.com.au<br>MOTORCYCLE NEWS is in its infancy, but it looks to have a promising future.<br>It was launched in Perth only a month ago but is already averaging 1000 hits a day, not bad traffic considering how hard it is to be registered with major search engines.<br>The eventual aim is to make the online magazine a paying concern through advertising and Web hosting for bike dealers. And the method adheres strictly to the successful formula for building Web sites - forget flashy technology and graphics and just deliver the information.<br>Highlights include international racing, latest motorcycle news, Australian road racing, dirt racing, product tests, bike tests and rally news. A popular section is biker travel stories.<br>PERTH INTERNET<br>WestOz Directory<br>westoz.netfirms.com<br>ROY FORD of Technology Exchange Consulting has just finished compiling this new Internet directory for WA.<br>It has more than 4000 URLs and Mr Ford believes it is the biggest State directory published. His aim is to add more new sites weekly.<br>Sites are predominantly, but not exclusively, WA content, with some specific industry sites such as farming, forestry and government.<br>Three indexing methods are in operation; alphabetical, by category and by customer.<br>Mr Ford says pages should display in three to four seconds on average.<br></font></p>
