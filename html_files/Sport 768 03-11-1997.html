            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE is a morbid fascination to watching rugby league these days.<br>The once-good game is badly hurt by Rupert Murdoch's Super League split.<br>Crowds for Rupertball - as its critics call it - and the traditional Australian Rugby League are small. To compensate, the promoters and commentators of Rupertball, in particular, are reaching new heights - or plumbing new depths - of outrageous hyperbole.<br>In the relative calm before cricket returns to our screens in a big way, Channel 9 had the first Super League Test between Australia and Great Britain from Wembley Stadium very late on Saturday night.<br>Tests were once the pinnacle of the game. Any honest player would say his ambition was to wear the green and gold of Australia. Now that green and gold looks over-designed and over-marketed.<br>International games, with a few exceptions, have declined in value over the past 20 years because Australia has been the only country able, or willing, to devote money to the code.<br>Rupertball has sought to change that. It has its tentacles in every other league-playing nation. It has pumped big sums of money, perhaps $4 million, into the World Club Championship, only to see it fail because the overseas sides were little better than amateurs.<br>And Rupertball also has decided to try to be traditional by having Test matches with the once-proud British who dominated the code from its inception to the mid-1960s.<br>This brings us back to Saturday night. If you had the volume off, the Test, won 38-14 by Australia, would have looked like a reasonable game. Australia was a little sleepy in the first half and allowed Britain to grab the lead for a short time. Britain faded in the final 20 minutes, a hallmark of the lack of fitness of sides outside Australia.<br>Even Perth Reds or South Queensland Crushers on a bad day kept at it hammer and tongs until the end.<br>Unfortunately, the volume was on when I watched, and made me think the commentators were watching a different game in some parallel universe. Each try in the first half - Australian skipper Laurie Daley scored three - was described as brilliant at worst. Mostly they were ?sensational? or in the case of one easy Daley trot to the line ?a work of genius?.<br>What the commentators were doing was hyping the Test, hoping their gloss might conceal a flawed product.<br>Rupertball has promoted the game like this all year, using dancing girls and fireworks to make it appear an exciting entertainment.<br>Super League has Americanised rugby league to the point where a very simple piece of play like a good tackle is seen as the work of a superman. One hopes the schism can be mended before Super League hypes rugby league out of the hearts and minds of the many people who once liked the game for what it was ... good, honest, no-frills combat.<br></font></p>
