            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HELLO again. I have been doing exhaustive research on the habits of lounge lizards for the past couple of weeks and have been unable to come to the keyboard.<br>But a break in the tennis, or was it cricket, and a shade too much holiday rest has awoken me so I may as well share the findings.<br>The WA lounge lizard population reaches its peak in the three weeks immediately after Christmas. Numbers build steadily from the middle of December, plateau until about now, then decline gradually until the end of the month.<br>By February they are as thin on the ground as they are thin in the hair. Breeding takes place a good 35-40 years before initial hatching.<br>In fact lounge lizards themselves do not breed - this being a far too exhausting task - but leave it to younger SNAGs and BYMs (bright young men) to get on with the job.<br>Also, there is no known female of the species despite years of conjecture and idle speculation. And no one's had the courage to actually ask a female of any species if she is a lounge lizard, fearing the reply: ?Can't you see I'm busy with your kids??<br>The lizard environment varies only in place names. It may be Rottnest Island (one of the highest concentrations), Dunsborough, Busselton or Augusta. They have been found as far north as Broome and Exmouth, though mainly in the winter.<br>What all these have in common is a TV, fridge, comfy chair and willing (or bribed) helping hands. A nearby bottle shop and fast food outlet or TAB also seem to encourage growth.<br>Under the intense glare of my microscope the following trends emerged in a typical lounge lizard's day:<br>8am: still snoring - they all seem to snore.<br>9am: reading newspaper in favourite chair; paper having been handed to them by child or dog. Also, drinking tea or coffee prepared by child, but probably not dog.<br>AN ASIDE. It is important that lounge lizards have bred in an earlier stage of their life cycle, preferably eight to 10 years earlier so that children can understand and undertake direct orders like: ?Get me a coffee will you darling?. No lounge lizard worth his salt will try to use his spouse for such tasks and trying to is asking for trouble.<br>Children at eight to 10 are known to complete these tasks cheerily although with occasional mutterings. Teenagers are known to greet such demands with the words: ?In your dreams, fat stuff.?<br>9.05am: have TV turned on while reading paper. Often doubt Tony Greig's word on putch report.<br>9.30am: turn to news pages having finished sports pages of paper.<br>9.32am: finish paper; more coffee.<br>10.30am: lunch at cricket, time for refreshing snack of peanuts, chips, cold pizza and quick check of contents of fridge.<br>10.35am: refresh contents of fridge and begin refreshing contents of stomach with same.<br>11am: and again.<br>11.30am: that Bill Lawry's a joke ... another if you don't mind, my love.<br>12noon: don't mind if I do.<br>1pm: snoring.<br>3pm: have cordless phone brought to them by admiring child to ring fellow lounge lizard about possible barbie, but more probably drinks.<br>4pm: first palate-cleansing ale.<br>6pm: take wife and adoring kids out for a treat.<br>6.30pm: chunky chips bit salty and greasy, but are washed down easily.<br>10pm: snoring.<br>And so it goes in perfect circles, interspersed with unlikely episodes of fishing, bike riding, picnicking, sitting on beaches, sitting in hotels, but mostly sitting in comfy chairs.<br>More than one lounge lizard has been heard to say: ?You wouldn't be dead for quids.? And the wife of more than one lounge lizard has been heard to mutter: ?Not if I can help it, fat stuff.?<br></font></p>
