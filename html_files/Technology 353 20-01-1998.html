            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>SPORT<br>Australian Open<br>If you want to watch something other than the Australian Open on TV this week but still want to keep up with the tournament, this is the place.IBM brings its artillery of technology to all the Grand Slams and uses comprehensive Web sites at each to display the results of its work. So you will find player profiles, constantly updated scores and pictures of vital matches taken by the Net Cam. The site is a bit leaner and faster than in previous years too, which will help Open addicts. (DW)<br>READER<br>Snakes, Harmful and Harmless<br>Brian Bush has been around reptiles all his life. Unlike many of us, it would appear he's not scared of snakes. He's the manager of Snakes Harmful and Harmless, a WA company that provides lectures and displays for corporations, government departments, the military, special interest groups and schools.At his Web site, visitors can peruse a broad range of herpetological information with a WA flavour and learn about the WA Society of Amateur Herpetologists (WASAH). He also includes links to research and published papers, snakebite first aid and a report to CALM on pest snake removal.One to visit when the school project on snakes and reptiles comes around. Or to get a new perspective on our slithering friends ? or was that enemies? (SY)<br>FUN<br>Unofficial Constable Care Page<br>Constable Care comes to work at The West when no one else is here. We don't know who he is, but are glad of his daily wisdoms on the weather page. This site, maintained by Ron Murray, appears to be a labour of love for the Constable's ?Classic Quotes? which rank him right up there with the great Scot William McGonagall.Some praise from the site: ?The wonder of Constable Care is the manner in which he gets his verses (for want of a better word!) to almost, but not quite, rhyme, and to almost, but not quite, scan. If you think it's easy, try it yourself. The man is obviously a genius.?<br>If you are unfamiliar with Care, these pages are a must. Where else could you find verse of the following calibre?<br>?When the weather is helter-skelter/ensure your pet has adequate shelter?. Or ?senior citizens, please take care/when crossing roads/And drivers also be aware.? (DW)<br>MEDIA<br>Maxi<br>I still haven't found anything to beat curling up on the couch with a trashy women's mag but Maxi Mag gives me another excuse to stay glued in front of the monitor. With a mix of informative articles, news snippets and tech issues from savvy female columnists, Maxi provides a grey-matter stimulating diversion from the many distractions on the Web. But a word of warning. Maxi writers and participants in Maxi forums aren't afraid to speak their minds on everything from sexual health to social issues. Not for the timid. The only other drawback is the features don't seem to be updated all that often (SY)<br>ENTERTAINMENT<br>The Amazing Dancing Baby<br>By now, many readers will have seen or downloaded the bizarre 3D dancing baby that has been doing the rounds of the Net for some months. But some people just can't get enough and Web pages are springing up everywhere.The ?original unofficial? home page of the amazing (and, dare I say it, quite ugly) dancing baby boasts no less than 18 versions in a mix of QuickTime and AVI formats including techno baby, psycho baby and a full-screen version.Not all are housed on the same server and not all were working when I visited. The original baby film was created with 3DStudio Max and Character Studio from Kinetix by a trio including Ron Lussier, formerly of LucasArts Entertainment.This site has a link to Lussier's site, Burning Pixel Productions, where he has the original ?little bugger? and two of his own variations. (SY)<br>ENTERTAINMENT<br>Sherman's Lagoon<br>Reader Don Dragicevich submitted this funny site which displays the comic strip Sherman's Lagoon by Jim Toomey. Sherman's Lagoon, according to Mr Toomey, ?is called Kapupu Lagoon, technically, and it's by the island of Kapupu, in the sunny South Pacific just west of the Elabaob Islands in the Palauan archipelago of Micronesia?.The undersea cartoon stars Sherman the dopey shark, his turtle sidekick Fillmore and other critters battling the encroachment of civilisation on their tropical paradise.Sherman's Lagoon appears in 125 US newspapers and elsewhere throughout the world. The Web version is one week behind print versions. Original strips are available for purchase online and you can also download a free screensaver. (SY)<br>SPORT<br>Official Patrick Rafter Supporters' Club<br>Pat Rafter is close to being the nicest guy in sport-hero land. He is also a bona-fide champion and a seemingly shy and reluctant sex symbol. A woman spectator of a certain age at Sydney's White City last week yelled to him: ?I want to be your girlfriend.? Each time he removes his sweaty shirt courtside there are screams and tears.<br>But why is it so? Don't expect any deep and profound answers at this site, maintained on three continents - Australia (in Maryborough, Queensland), Europe and the US - by ardent Rafter fans. This site is about adulation and hero worship.<br>It is packed with details of Rafter's tennis career and his personal life (he is one of nine children and is a chocaholic). The site claims the vast Rafter family backs it 100 per cent.<br>You can browse the photo gallery, join discussion groups, find out how to chat about Rafter on IRC and learn how to join Pat Rafter United, his fan club.
