Or he would have been if he could actually feel his head. He was 50km from Melbourne. It was late and dark. He felt like a dog's bottom.<br>He looked at the straight road ahead. It wasn't nailed down. It seemed to float off into the murky sky. The constant roar of trucks going about their business even on this Anzac Day weekend 1980 came at him not from the correct side of the road on level terms, but out of the sky swooping like overweight magpies.<br>One would surely hit him. Maybe it already had.<br>There was no earth, only disembodiment. There was no geography. He had four on the floor of his little Fiat and about 0.15 in his bloodstream. That's all he knew of the present. The car burbled through what should have been a flat and dreary landscape. But Dafydd was flying in a land of many hills. He was on one straight road. But to Dafydd there were any number. They hung out over emptiness. They disappeared into the stars or the sides of the hills that weren't there either.<br>Where was he? How did he get here? Why did he look like an overused toothbrush in a smelly floral shirt with stains? Why had his parents called him Dafydd?<br>It was all the Ayatollah Khomeini's fault. No, it was Jimmy Carter, and Canberra, and the National Press Club. It seemed like only yesterday he was there having a quiet beer with mates.<br>Indeed it was only yesterday, his slowly reassembling brain suddenly muttered, giving Dafydd such a start he nearly drove off a cliff in the air like Arlo Guthrie in the Motorcycle Song. There was no cliff, only memories fluttering like dandruff in a strong wind. He had decided to have a quick one with John Bird, an old high school mate, to break his journey to Melbourne from Sydney where he'd had a quiet little holiday.<br>A beer, a catch-up, then home in Melbourne by mid-evening. That was the plan. That was yesterday.<br>John Bird and he had indeed gone for a beer. It turned from one or two to seven or eight when they were joined by two other Canberra desperates looking for action on Anzac Day.<br>By beer number nine, Dafydd had contented himself with the thought that he'd spend the night on John Bird's sofa and strike out for Melbourne in the morning.<br>It never happened. Jimmy Carter sent his troops in to Iran to rescue American hostages. The mission was a disaster. It was all on the TV in front of Dafydd and his drinking companions in the Press Club.<br>They were intelligent. One was a lawyer, two were climbing the public service ladder and Dafydd was scribbling for a daily paper in Melbourne. Intelligent, but not very bright unfortunately.<br>?Did you see that?? John Bird shouted at the television, ?it's World War III. We better go out with a bang. There's a party we need to get to.?<br>?Yeah, let's go. Where's the party?? asked Dafydd. ?Sydney. Glebe. We can be there in four hours. I know a car we can borrow. It's a V-8. We'll need plenty of cans.?<br>The driving to Sydney was shared, as was the can-opening. They howled through the misty night, swooping down the slippery, winding Razorback Range without noticing. The V-8 hummed, the beer cans opened with startled little zings.<br>About 1.30am, they felt sophisticated and loquacious enough for a party. In other words they were rotten.<br>The party in Glebe was a very nice affair with lots of bright, intelligent people standing about drinking white wine from casks and discussing David Williamson plays.?There's gonna be a bloody war. Let's get out of it,? roared John Bird as he fell among the party-goers. ?Yeah, bloody right, saworry orright,? Dafydd backed him up, breathing dreadful NSW beer fumes over a serious-looking social worker.<br>Half an hour later they were in the V-8 heading for King's Cross. ?Never liked those snobs anyway,? growled John Bird. ?Didn't have to throw us out so soon, though.?<br>At King's Cross they took a wrong turn, down a dark alley. In the headlights they could see two bearded, beer-gutted guys giving a skinny bloke what used to be called a damn good thrashing.<br>The big blokes looked up at the inebriated lads in the V-8. What they saw did not impress them, or frighten them, and they went on beating the bejesus out of the poor little bloke.<br>?Gee we should do something,? said Dafydd. ?Yeah, let's get out of here. Never liked King's Cross,? said John Bird, ?the car can go back to its owner. He's over the bridge staying at his sister's in North Sydney. He'll let us stay the night.?<br>The V-8's owner was happy to have his car back. Only problem was he didn't know it had been borrowed. So . . . no bed for the night.<br>It was 3.30am. The boys were stumbling - one was actually crawling - across the multi-lane entrance to the Harbour Bridge. John Bird knew a bloke just the other side of the bridge. ?He'll put us up. Good bloke,? said John Bird as he fell over.<br>The good bloke, who lived in Kirribilli, wasn't all that pleased to see John Bird, or Dafydd, or the other two who had managed to steal a cask from the Glebe party and were now pouring it straight into their mouths, and missing, and spilling it all over the good bloke's carpet.<br>?You can stay. But you've got to be out by 7. I've got things to do and people to see,? said the good bloke.<br>They put their heads down, then next minute they were on a sunlit Kirribilli street hailing a cab to the airport. It was 7.30am. ?Never liked that bloke,? said John Bird, squinting to keep his eyes from falling out.<br>They caught a plane to Canberra. During the 30-minute flight, Dafydd went to the loo only three times to relieve himself of the previous night's excess baggage.<br>In Canberra he got in his Fiat, pointed it in the direction of away and prayed for a motel room to appear in the next couple of hours so he could shower, sleep and eat, having done none of those things since he stepped into the Press Club for a quick one with John Bird.<br>It was the Anzac Day weekend. No one had a room; not at Albury, or Wodonga or Wangaratta or Benalla nor, even after seven hours of flying and hoping, at Seymour less than an hour out of Melbourne.<br>It was late and dark.<br>Dafydd Wooley was feeling light-headed . . .<br></font></p>
