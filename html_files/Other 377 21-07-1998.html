            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NORMALLY I will champion the Internet as the most marvellous medium of our age. Sometimes I wonder why I bother.<br>In the past week, the Net has been the focus of the most tawdry scenes.<br>An American calling himself Oscar Wells announced he had a Web site on which two 18-year-old Californians - honours students and pillars of the church - would lose their virginity to each other.<br>The couple, Mike and Diane, were pictured on the Web with black masking their faces. However, they showed two gorgeously healthy bodies, which made one cynical to say the least.<br>Mike and Diane had the bodies of actors or models.<br>Investigations by Salon Magazine revealed that the people behind Wells' site, called Our First Time, had connections to movie-making sites, mostly of a dubious nature.<br>Further investigations by the Washington Post alleged that Wells was a pseudonym for Ken Tipton, an actor and aspiring film-maker.<br>The Oscar Wells tag stemmed from Orson Welles, the legendary actor-writer, who 60 years ago just happened to perpetrate the massive War of the Worlds hoax.<br>The Post also reported that the IEG organisation which had taken over the running of Our First Time had withdrawn from the whole Mike and Diane show when the site's designer said he planned to renege on his promise not to charge for access and institute a $5 fee on August 4, the designated date for Mike and Diane's very public first love. IEG alleged the couple said they would not have sex on the Web, deciding that they weren't ready to take that step.<br>IEG, by the way, is home to dozens of hard and softcore porn sites, and lists the Pamela Anderson-Tommy Lee video as one of its triumphs.<br>All in all a desperate charade which had millions crashing Our First Time, and countless others wondering what good such a public display of a very private moment could bring.<br>If claims that the love-making was to be tastefully presented, then it was little more than soft porn being promoted.<br>If claims that the love-making would be good sex education for adolescents, why choose the possible fumblings and embarrassments of two virgins to show?<br>The questions go on, but foremost is the concern that such public stupidity is so easy to promote on the Net. Its near-anarchical freedom can be such a good weapon for openness and free speech. And such a bludgeon in the hands of people like Mike, Diane and Oscar Wells.<br>It is refreshing to remember that all such popular media have messy beginnings.<br>Indeed, it was on the very modern medium of the Web that I was reading Thomas Mallory's Morte d'Arthur the day after Channel 9's Merlin mini-series, when I stumbled on the news that William Caxton, who printed the first edition, was a messy and disorganised publisher who liked to meddle with the works he printed.<br>Thus he played around with some of Mallory's text and even had chapters beginning in the middle of sentences.<br>Caxton was a pioneer. Without him, English literature would not have become public as early as it did.<br>Books would have remained much longer in the domain of the privileged few. The Dark Ages would have been darker.<br>Maybe we can forgive Mike and Diane their cyber-fumblings in the name of progress.<br>Help Desk<br>Salon Magazine:<br>www.salonmagazine.com<br>Coverage of Our First Time:<br>Type ?Mike and Diane to lose virginity? in the search field of www.newsindex.com<br>Morte D'Arthur:<br>www.celtic-twilight.com/<br>malory/lemorte-menu.htm<br>Good King Arthur resources (for Merlin fans):<br>freespace.virgin.net/david.<br>ford2/arthur.html<br></font></p>
