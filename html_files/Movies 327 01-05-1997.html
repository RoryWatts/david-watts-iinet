            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">New releases<br>BLACKROCK ???<br>The lightness of touch which characterised Nick Enright's play Blackrock (on in Perth last year) is missing in the screen version of the sad story of a girl raped and killed after a surf club party. Director Steven Vidler spends less time looking at the lifestyles of the young people involved and more examining the aftermath of the killing and the way the town is divided, with some seeing the girl as ?asking for it?. The movie, based on the real-life murder of Newcastle girl Leigh Leigh, and starring Simon Lyndon as Ricko and Laurence Breuls as Jared, is bleak but very watchable. Rated MA (Pam Brown).<br>BROTHER OF SLEEP<br>Cinema Paradiso's Cine 7 international film season starts today with Germany's Brother of Sleep, a 19th century tale of a mountain village peasant possessed of a natural talent for music and his bizarre relationship with nature. Director Joseph Vilsmaier has described his film as a study of the ?abnormal? - those who hardly ever find support in the world, yet try to live their lives with passion, feelings and courage. Brother of Sleep is one of those atmospheric art-house films with eerie locations, strangely pious peasants, a disturbing series of events and an overall sense of gloom and foreboding. Rated MA (Not Previewed)<br>DONNIE BRASCO ???<br>What is Hollywood going to do when Al Pacino is no longer with us? Who is going to play the archetypal mafia gangster? Pacino is at it again in Donnie Brasco. Rather than a high-up heavy, he is a lowly crim in Brooklyn often reduced to robbing parking meters to keep gang bosses happy. Into his life walks Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), who we know from the first minutes is really FBI agent Joe Pistone. An endearing bond forms between the down-at-heel hitman and the cocky, young informant, who becomes a good gangster; even cutting up dead bodies of ?rivals?. Don't look for Godfather-type glamour or Goodfellas energy. This is a grim tale based on a true story. Rated MA (David Watts)<br>GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI<br>Nearly 31 years after an assassin's bullet ended the life of civil rights activist Medgar Evers - the first field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People - young assistant district attorney Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin) courageously decides to reopen the case. DeLaughter jeopardises his career and marriage as he works with Evers' widow Myrlie in an attempt to bring the twice-acquitted white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith (James Woods) to justice. Director Rob Reiner has long wanted to make a film dealing with race relations and he often consulted Myrlie Evers-Williams in bringing this true story to the screen. Rated M (Not Previewed)<br>FEMALE PERVERSIONS ??½<br>Billed as ?a powerfully rich exploration of gender, sexuality, identity and self realisation,? Female Perversions doesn't fulfil these great expectations, at least not in a broad sense. On some levels the film explores how society expects women to conform to its norms, in everything from fashion and family to career and sexuality. But most of the time the focus seems rather more narrow, concentrating specifically on lawyer Eve Stephens (Tilda Swinton), a woman who seems in total control but is actually struggling with her insecurities, sexuality, her past and how each encroaches on her professional life. Screening at the Luna Cinemas. Rated R (Sue Yeap)  MARVIN'S ROOM ????<br>Two sisters, one a frumpy spinster (Diane Keaton) and the other a head-strong single mother (Meryl Streep,) must confront unresolved family issues when the elder sister Bessie finds she is dying of leukaemia. Bessie has spent most of her life caring for their bedridden father Marvin in Florida and Lee thinks she has wasted her life. Lee agrees to travel from Ohio for a bone marrow test but has her own problems, namely her wayward son Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has landed in a mental institution for burning down their house. Instead of drowning in Hollywood sentimentality, director Jerry Zaks comes up with a sensitive and humorous film that explores issues of personal sacrifice, family obligations and the power of love to heal. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>TURBULENCE<br>It's Christmas Eve and flight attendant Teri Halloran (Lauren Holly) is looking forward to a peaceful flight from New York to Los Angeles. All that changes when four federal marshalls board the plane with two shackled prisoners. Ryan Weaver is a charming but deadly serial killer (Ray Liotta) and the other, named Stubbs, a ruthless armed robber (Brendan Leeson). Soon enough passengers and crew start dropping like flies and Halloran is left in a deadly mid-air cat and mouse game with Weaver. Rated M (Not Previewed)<br>Recently out<br>BLOOD AND WINE ??½<br>Director Bob Rafelson describes Blood and Wine as part of a trilogy of dysfunctional family studies which started with Five Easy Pieces and The King of Marvin Gardens. Given he apparently worked on the Blood And Wine project for four years, and given a strong cast, including Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine and Judy Davis, the result is disappointing. Despite some luminous casting and Rafelson's intention to make a brooding film noir psychological study, this has a B-grade heart. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Chris McLeod)<br>THE CASTLE ???<br>The Frontline team makes a smooth transition from small to big screen, using a subtle, naturalistic style to tell the tale of an Oz family so low on the evolutionary scale they make the Simpsons look like the Kennedys. Not nearly as richly layered as the average episode of Frontline - the story is so straightforward it's rather dull - but the dialogue and performances are very funny. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>EXTREME MEASURES ???½<br>Hugh Grant puts away his usual soppy comic character to portray a brilliant young doctor deeply involved in a serious medical and ethical dilemma. A homeless patient dies mysteriously in front of him and then the body goes missing. Grant delves in, and what he finds is murk and controversy, as well as a God-like Gene Hackman experimenting on people who cannot defend themselves. It is a dramatic, gritty film with a theme to think about, topped off with excellent New York backdrops. Rated M (David Watts)<br>JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE ???½<br>In the fourth instalment of Jackie Chan's popular Police Story series, Hong Kong cop Jackie chases spies and a nuclear warhead from the Ukraine to the Gold Coast, battling Russian and Chinese mobs, even sharks. His stunts range from snow-boarding to jumping from an exploding helicopter. And don't leave until the lights come up or you'll miss the now infamous bloopers. Rated M (Sue Yeap)<br>JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH ????<br>Henry Selick, the brilliant animator behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, uses stop-motion animation to bring Roald Dahl's beloved children's book to vivid life, setting James and his insect buddies on a magical journey to the Big Apple inside a big peach. Selick is helped by some lovely voice work, including Susan Sarandon as the seductive, beatnik-ish spider. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>ONE FINE DAY ???<br>Michelle Pfeiffer is Melanie Parker, a stressed-out supermum and architect also raising precocious five-year-old son Sammy. George Clooney is Jack Gordon, a leading newspaper columnist and father every other weekend who is suddenly thrust into full-time parenting when his ex dumps his five-year-old Maggie on him. When the pair are thrown together one rainy New York day, everything that can go wrong does, but you just know they'll fall for each other. A feelgood in which ER's bad boy Clooney makes up for his dismal appearance in last year's From Dusk Till Dawn. Rated PG (Sue Yeap)<br>RETURN OF THE JEDI ????<br>The third instalment of the Star Wars special edition trilogy is not super-loaded with new special effects, but it never needed to be. Luke Skywalker's final confrontation with Darth Vader and the evil Emperor was spectacular enough in first release. The long opening at the grotesque Jabbah the Hutt's palace is peppered with remarkable new aliens, however. No matter the technology, Return of the Jedi remains heartwarming, exciting and even cute (the Ewoks provoke as many oohs and aahs as ever). Rated PG (David Watts)<br>THE SAINT ???½<br>Simon Templar, a man with no real history or identity, is a master of disguise and thievery in Australian director Phillip Noyce's big screen update of The Saint. Val Kilmer's Saint bears practically no resemblance to The Saint of the 30s films or 60s TV series, but he's still appealing as he slips in and out of trouble in the new Russia. Rated M (Sue Yeap)  TRIGGER HAPPY ??½<br>Even though the Rat Pack barely survived the Kennedy administration, the recklessly amoral spirit of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jun., Joey Bishop and the gang still lives on. Now Larry Bishop, son of comic Joey, has gone the whole hog and made the kind of contemporary gangster movie that Frank, Dino and the others would have been proud to star in. It has nightclubs, guys in flashy clothes, sexy ?broads? and cryptically hip lingo. What it also has - and what will annoy many - is a plot so convoluted that I doubt whether even the writer knows what's going on. Trigger Happy is screening at the Revue Cinema and Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>VEGAS VACATION<br>Fourteen years on from the original National Lampoon's Vacation, the Griswolds are back and heading for some high rolling holiday high jinx in Las Vegas. Clark (Chevy Chase), Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) Rusty and Audrey are put to the test when the temptations of Vegas are laid before them and, predictably, Clark becomes hooked on gambling.
