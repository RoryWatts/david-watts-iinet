He passed on this e-mail from the Kittyhawk: ?I was surfing your Web site, which is outstanding I might add, trying to get some information about the surf conditions in the local area. I am currently on board a US Navy ship and we are going to be making a port visit there at the end of the month. I was hoping that you could give me some info on what the usual conditions are like and where there are some good spots to have a surf.?<br>Major Smith was able to fire off an instant reply telling the surf-starved American that Trigg's waves, indeed all Perth's waves, were having a rare winter holiday and to consider hoofing it to Margaret River while in port.<br>The Trigg site gives fast and clear information about that beach. As well as history, news and membership information for the life saving club, this site is also setting up Webcams to give prospective visitors a look at the conditions.<br>MOON LANDING<br>Yahoo<br>headlines.yahoo.com/Full_Coverage_Science/<br>Moon_La Online - Earthlings' Finest Hour<br>www.discovery.com/indep/newsfeatures/<br>moonwalk/challenge.ht THE first URL, above, will take you to Yahoo's excellent page marking last week's 30th anniversary of man's moon landing.<br>As well as the latest news and features about anniversary events, it also has a good list of Web sites set up to honour Apollo 11's feat.<br>Sites mentioned include the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Discovery Online's Earthlings' Finest Hour and Nasa's tribute. The best appears to be Discovery Online's (second URL above) which is tightly written and packed with top quality pictures as well as the ability to play RealPlayer video and audio of key moments of the landing.<br>The best is a three-minute slide-show video covering the whole mission and showing Neil Armstrong's ?small step for man?.<br>MILLENNIUM<br>1900 v Now<br>cgi.pathfinder.com/time/time100/timewarp/<br>timewarp.html<br>TIME magazine is spending a lot of time and space trying to unravel the 20th century. This is one of its better efforts and allows surfers to compare today's world with that of 1900.<br>By clicking on a subject in a drop-down menu, users can see instant comparisons between 1900 and now in fields such as; world population, life expectancy, infant mortality, size of the British empire, unemployment, miles of railroad, land under irrigation, cars sold worldwide, world forests and the Olympics.<br></font></p>
