            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>Leave it to Beaver (PG)<br>Christopher McDonald, Cameron Finley<br>Directed by Andy Cadiff<br>THE grand old cliche ?don't judge a book by its cover? applies beautifully to the family film Leave it to Beaver. At first glance it looks like some horrible homage to materialism, suburbia and small-town USA values.<br>This is not surprising when you consider the Hollywood sausage factory is so strapped for original ideas it has taken to raiding the cupboard of television sitcoms for ideas.<br>In doing so, viewers have been either assaulted or left totally un-entertained by ordinary fare such as The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones.<br>An occasional gem of a rip-off, such as The Addams Family (particularly Addams Family Values) seems to have inspired producers to keep ransacking the TV vaults.<br>And thus we have Leave it to Beaver, made for the box in the late 50s and early 60s, and of very little consequence to Australian audiences. Does anyone even remember it?<br>But something good happened during this transition of so-so sitcom to big-screen, holiday film. It got better.<br>The original Leave it to Beaver dealt with the day-to-day problems of a dreamtime American family called the Cleavers, in particular their youngest boy, Theodore (nicknamed Beaver).<br>It took itself fairly seriously, presenting ideal families with suit-wearing dads and happy, cooking mums, much as The Donna Reed Show or Father Knows Best . . . or Patty Duke or Bachelor Father and so on.<br>This film version still has a postcard-pretty suburban setting (think of the ritziest bits of Claremont).<br>Dad (Christopher McDonald from Veronica's Closet) wears a suit and shouts ?Honey, I'm home? after a hard day at the office, and Mum (Janine Turner) is nothing short of immaculate, even wearing pearls and high-heels when vacuuming.<br>But it is all a delightful, light-hearted spoof of 50s America, thrusting 90s-type problems on to the pretty setting.<br>The star is Beaver (a cute performance from little Cameron Finley). He wants a new bike and, following the advice of Eddie Haskell, the slimy friend of Beaver's idolised big brother, Wally (handsomely portrayed by Erik von Detten), he crawls to his football-loving dad, saying he will play for the local team (even though he is half the size of the rest) and even become a doctor . . . in Africa.<br>He gets the bike, but loses it to a very 90s thief, whose mate also happens to steal Wally's new girlfriend in a welter of teenage hormonal angst.<br>All these problems must be resolved by the doting and slightly dotty Cleaver family. And 88 minutes of screen time is just the right amount to devote to what is very light material.<br>However, it is hard not to come away feeling a little warm-hearted after what turns out to be a pleasant essay on parenting and unconditional love.<br></font></p>
