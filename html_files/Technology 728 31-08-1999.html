            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SOMETIMES you suspect that it might actually be fun to live in Victoria.<br>Forget the abysmal weather. The Vics have arts, culture, the Melbourne Cup and the MCG.<br>They also have Jeff Kennett, a Premier who proves that politicians' egos are in direct inverse proportion to the size of the State they rule.<br>The latest evidence is a centrepiece for Mr Kennett's bid to retain power at the September 18 State election.<br>It is a Web site called Jeff.com.au, which strips away any pretence Victorian politics is about choosing a party to govern - it is about personality, and the personality of Mr Kennett in particular.<br>Jeff.com.au is unique in Australia. Not even Pauline Hanson has used the Web in such an egotistical way before.<br>Past efforts at cyber-politicking have been modest, even shy affairs where parties have set out their policies, told their version of events in news releases and, begrudgingly, offered feedback pages.<br>Occasionally campaigning politicians have run up amateurish sites in basic HTML to put themselves forward.<br>Mr Kennett has now gone about 100 steps higher in cyberspace.<br>Jeff.com.au is a beautifully designed site. It does everything the Web design textbooks say. It is fast, not graphics intensive, clearly labelled and easily navigated.<br>It is unambiguous with its message - elect Jeff Kennett.<br>The opening page follows the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) philosophy. Amid hundreds of pixels of white are a few basic words and a picture of Mr Kennett along with some navigation buttons.<br>If you look hard enough you can see a button for the Premier's party, the actual governors of the State.<br>It gives the term small-l Liberal a very online meaning.<br>The further you venture into the site, the more you realise this election is not too serious an affair, and Mr Kennett is oozing confidence.<br>After all, he has dared ask his electors to go to the polls during the AFL finals series. That is akin to asking devout Christians to go to the casino on Sunday morning ... he's probably done that, too.<br>Jeff.com.au promises the following goodies:<br>? A behind-the-scenes look at Mr Kennett's life. This is how the site puts it - ?Do you hunger to know more about the man behind Victoria? Exclusive to the Jeff.com.au Web site, we offer a sneak peak into what Jeff gets up to in his (very limited) spare-time. Discover Jeff's love of footy, flowers and fashion ...?<br>? Speaking Out - a section devoted to Mr Kennett's opinions, quotes and vision for Victoria.<br>?A grand prix game which can be played online with the Shockwave plug-in.<br>?The Campaign Trail game - this is still under construction but will allow users to ?deliver leaflets, beat the streets with the megaphone and strategically release policies, converting Opposition supporters along the way?.<br>?If you haven't had enough of Mr Kennett by then, you can download a special Jeff screensaver which, the site says, ?will keep you entertained for hours on end?.<br>Whether Jeff.com.au enhances the Web's claims to be a weapon for democracy is debatable, but Mr Kennett gets 10 out of 10 for propaganda.<br>It is probably the 1990s way to erect a statue of yourself.<br>www.jeff.com.au<br></font></p>
