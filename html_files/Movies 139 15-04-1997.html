            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Wind in the Willows (G)<br>Steve Coogan, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Anthony Sher<br>Directed by Terry Jones<br>? ? ?<br>THE Wind in the Willows is one of the unquestioned classics of modern literature, having delighted children since published in 1908.<br>Kenneth Grahame's gently humorous tale of the irascible Mr Toad and his friends Mole, Ratty and Mr Badger even moved President Theodore Roosevelt to say he had accepted the characters as old friends.<br>A. A. Milne said the book could not be criticised ?because it is criticising us?.<br>And now it is with us again; still as charming and gentle, slightly silly and morally uplifting as ever. Former Monty Python crew member Terry Jones (the one with the lisp who likes dressing up in women's clothes) has adapted it into a film that will have children chuckling.<br>Jones has toyed with the story a little to bring it up to date for a generation reared on Paul Jennings, Aggro and The Simpsons.<br>In a brief browse through the novel I could not find references to explosives, environmental carnage and greedy corporations, for example. But Jones has added them all without disturbing the plot too much.<br>Mole (a lovely portrayal by Steve Coogan) is forced out of his hole and takes up with Ratty (Eric Idle at his best). They try to enlist the help of Mr Toad (a green Jones) to save Mole's home, but Toad leads them all a merry dance with his frenetic obsessions for new playthings.<br>Toad buys and crashes car after honking, tooting car until he is almost bankrupt and his palatial river-bank home is taken over by the evil weasels (led by Anthony Sher).<br>Mayhem and adventure follow as Mole, Ratty, Mr Toad and the solid Mr Badger fight to regain the home.<br>This is all done in a charming, comic manner with a few Terminator-like scares when the good river-bank folk are close to being fed into the weasels' giant dog food mincer.<br>The Wind in the Willows does not need added comic flavour and Jones has resisted going over the top, despite his Monty Python credentials.<br>One gets the feeling the film was a chance for a jolly time by a lot of talented British actors during a brief off-season. It is certainly played out a bit like a holiday romp at the end of the pier.<br>The costumes, for example, are a treat, straight from the Edwardian and Etonian school. No one actually wears a convincing animal costume.<br>Idle has a long tail and funny whiskers to indicate he is a rat, Jones is painted green and has a pillow or too to make him toad-like; and the fine Shakespearean actor Nicol Williamson has long black and grey hair ... he is a badger.<br>It doesn't matter. Very quickly the viewers identify with the characters.<br>One possible disappointment might be for old Python fans who expect magic and riotous laughter when Jones, Idle, Michael Palin (who has a small part) and John Cleese (another small, very funny part) come together.<br>These chaps set awfully high standards early in their careers, culminating with Life of Brian. Do not expect anything of that sort. Within limits this is a lovingly faithful, mildly funny adaptation.<br></font></p>
