            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TO USE Bruce McAvaney's favourite phrase, you just had to feel for Australian basketballer Mark Bradtke yesterday. The talented pivot scored the onerous job of marking Lithuanian giant Arvydas Sabonis.<br>The Lithuanians won the bronze largely because of Sabonis's height and strength. The Boomers looked drained by their great stoush against the Nightmare Team two days earlier.<br>In that Bradtke had to guard Shaquille O'Neal. Both O'Neal and Sabonis are as tall or taller than the height jumped by Robert Shavlakadze of the former Soviet Union (2.16m) to win the high jump at Rome in 1960.<br>It has been a weekend in which you just had to feel for a lot of people.<br>?The Woodies: Even though Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge won the tennis doubles gold, they had to put up with Gary Wilkinson asking them for the 100th time how the medal compared with a Wimbledon title.<br>What would they say? ?Ah, awful Gary. It doesn't even compare to a lightning tournament in Key Largo, Florida.?<br>You also had to feel for them because their achievement was watched by an ever-dwindling crowd which had come to see Lindsay Davenport beat Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario.<br>A small throng of raucous Aussie swimmers and rowers was described by the Los Angeles Times as ?a rag-tag collection of Australian Olympians just over from the village who made enough noise that the players couldn't hear a tennis ball drop?.<br>?The Australian kayakers: Someone in every final but only one bronze to show for it so far.<br>?Cyclist Patrick Jonker: He led the individual time trial at the halfway mark and was almost totally ignored by those damned Yankee cameras. He then had to wait for Miguel Indurain and the other big guns to finish - a bit like an amateur golfer on even par waiting for Greg Norman, Nick Faldo and John Daly to finish their rounds.<br>?Everyone who dived against Russian Dmitri Sautin: A perfect 10 off the platform was breathless stuff.<br>?The referees in the US-Yugoslavia basketball final: Imagine trying to calm Reggie Miller, Charles Barkley or Karl Malone when they have been angered by a fiery Yugoslav with a vain hint of gold in his nostrils.<br>T HE British: Another horror weekend: There were big hopes for Chris Broadman in the cycling time trial, Kelly Holmes in the women's 1500m, and the men's relay teams. But Roger Black stopped as though shot 50m from the tape in the 4x400m and the US - without Superman, who was recovering from a kryptonite attack on his hamstring - still won.<br>?Linford Christie: The great sprinter was rested from the 4x100m heats so he could gain glory in the final but the British team dropped the baton and did not qualify. Christie goes home from his last Games without a medal.<br>?Anybody who stayed up to watch rhythmic gymnastics.<br></font></p>
