            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Bushwhacked<br>Daniel Stern, Jon Polito<br>Brad Sullivan<br>Directed by Greg Beeman<br>AT THE whingeing ?I'm bored? end of the school holidays it is getting increasingly difficult for parents to muster the strength to take their kids to see Babe and Toy Story for the umpteenth time ... no matter how excellent they are.<br>And don't underestimate a child's ability to sit through the same film a dozen times. When my daughter was three she asked for Disney's Sleeping Beauty video on average twice a week for a whole year.<br>By then the staff were calling her Sleeping Beauty. On the 50th or 60th rental they presented her with a video of her own. It wasn't Sleeping Beauty unfortunately; I had to buy that.<br>And guess what? She went off it altogether and started watching My Little Pony.<br>I digress. So Babe might be beginning to pall. The good news is that Bushwhacked is here to entertain the little darlings and show parents there is more to the movies than pigs or toys.<br>When Bushwhacked was released in the US last year it was panned by critics.<br>They said it was unfunny, unnatural, over the top or just plain bad.<br>These critics weren't at the crowded northern suburbs cinema where I saw it. The audience clapped and cheered at the end. Just like the good old days at the Saturday afternoon matinee.<br>Bushwhacked is a star vehicle for lanky, gawky Daniel Stern. He was the incompetent adulterer in City Slickers, the bumbling, goofy burglar in the Home Alone films and a gum-chewing, dumb baseball coach in Rookie of the Year.<br>Here he is a bumbling, goofy, incompetent, gum-chewing delivery man whose idea of style is a leather jacket, shirt open halfway to the navel and Italian loafers.<br>Stern is Max Grabelski and he happens on what looks like a murder in a mansion where he is delivering packages.<br>The FBI, with a fat, bald Agent Parker (Jon Polito), breathless and foolish in charge, think Max is the baddy.<br>But, incompetent as he is, Max escapes and his fate intersects with Ranger Scout Troop 12 led by Mrs Patterson, played by Ann Dowd.<br>She's been entertaining her eager beaver little knot of six woggle wearers in the kitchen and backyard and they want adventure.<br>So Mrs Patterson hires Jack Erickson - a top Mr Clean performance by Brad Sullivan - to get the kids into the woods.<br>Max on the run takes Erickson's car, is mistaken for him and, wouldn't you know it, the city idiot is in charge in the great fresh outdoors.<br>Lots of predictable fun from then on as the scouts - believing Max is pretty good - tangle with bears, beehives, insect repellant and rapids.<br>They start to become worthy and good at outdoor life just as Erickson and Agent Palmer close in. Then the kids suspect Max is not a scout leader ... wonder why; could it be the walking shoes or the fag always hanging out his mouth?<br>But there's lots of fun to be had and Stern, who always seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown, has some wonderful hair-raising scenes perched on cliff ledges, rope bridges and across abysses.<br>Your enjoyment of Bushwhacked will be tempered by how much you can take of Stern.<br></font></p>
