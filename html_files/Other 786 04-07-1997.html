            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MIKE TYSON started the week off nicely didn't he? It was a mad, bad act, biting the ears of Evander Holyfield when he should have been concentrating on knocking the champ's block off.<br>Then our State Government got out of bed with Elle, so to speak, by jettisoning the troubled yacht racing syndicate whose credentials they appear not to have looked at closely enough.<br>Meanwhile, every talking head that ever there was watched Hong Kong go back to China.<br>In circles where I lurk, someone claimed they heard A Current Affair's Ray Martin come out with this lunacy: ?Interesting that Hong Kong is the only long-time British colony that hasn't taken to cricket, showing how inscrutable the Chinese are.?<br>Ray obviously forgot about that race of very inscrutable Canadians who today have to put up with their noisy neighbours in the US as they go bonkers celebrating the fourth of July. Ray also seemed to have overlooked the fact that, until very recently, the English themselves appeared to have forgotten how to play cricket, too. And there was no mention of the Scots, never a great nation of willow-wielders.<br>Slowly it dawns that this has been yet another week tinged with madness. What does it all mean? Well have you heard of Millennium Fever? This is a growing apprehension leading to weirdness that affects people waiting and watching for the new millennium, which is just three and a half years away on January 1, 2001 (there are those who swear it starts on January 1, 2000).<br>The new millennium, some believe, heralds the Second Coming when all evil (including Mike Tyson) will be driven from the planet in an apocalypse marked by comets and extraordinary acts of nature.<br>An article in the Rapture Index on the Internet explains that Millennium Fever broke out in the years leading to 1000AD. In 1841, Charles Mackay wrote a book called Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.IT he said of the 1000AD fever: ?Numerous fanatics appeared in France, Germany, and Italy at that time. The scene of the Last Judgment was expected to take place in Jerusalem in the year 999.?Buildings of every sort were suffered to fall into ruins. It was thought useless to repair them, when the end of the world was so near.?<br>But it didn't happen. The Rapture Index believes 2000AD won't be much different but the fever could be more infectious because of mass communication.<br>It says the warning signs for people likely to be affected are: earthquakes, floods, plagues, wars, major news involving Israel, Russia, or the Middle East and changes to the financial system (does this mean the GST?).<br>Then it lists signs that individuals may have caught the fever already. These include:Their personal planner calendar is blank after January 1, 2000 AD.They've modified their chimney so they can evacuate in a fit of rapture.They suffer from severe neck pains from constantly looking skyward.They've started hoarding big quantities of food.<br>But the good news is that Millennium Fever is not global. It can affect only those who live by the Christian calendar, the one that tells us this is 1997.<br>For example, the Chinese lunar calendar says it is now the year 4695 - a full 305 years away from the next millennium as far as 1.2 billion people are concerned.<br>Hindus are in the middle of a cycle that will end in the world's destruction. But this cycle has about 350,000 years to go apparently.And for Jews, who date time from the biblical Creation, 2000 will be 5760 and no big deal. For Muslims, who date their calendar from the prophet Muhammad's move from Mecca to Medina, 2000 will be Islamic year 1420.<br>Perhaps we needn't worry too much after all. But just in case, I've booked a passage on an asteroid that Beijing astronomers say will brush Earth on September 29, 2004 - if anyone is here, that is.<br></font></p>
