            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I saw a naked woman on the Web the other day. And despite what cruel and thoughtless people may say, this is not a regular occurrence on my PC.<br>The woman was squatting and had her back turned, though her head was turned coquettishly to the camera. She wore nothing but big leather boots and a grin that might be described as sultry. In some quarters, the pose would be called sensual or provocative.<br>It wasn't the pose that arrested my attention, however. It was where she was posing that caught my eye - slap bang on top of the puddle of water at Telstra's Big Pond site.<br>I was poking around Telstra sites trying to get information about 56K X2 modems so I could help a friend hook up to the Net. He had a Big Pond start-up CD and a shiny new US Robotics modem.<br>Anyway, the quest for X2 knowledge drove me to Big Pond and the naked woman. I did what any bloke would do when confronted with such a site - had a good, hard look, took a screen snapshot with the Print Screen key and moved on.<br>But first I e-mailed Big Pond support with the screenshot attached and asked them were they aware of this intrusion on their page ? plus a few X2-related questions as well.<br>About 10 minutes later, I returned to Big Pond and the woman was gone; vanished to be replaced by the rest of the raindrop graphic she had supplanted.<br>Word came from Telstra later in the day but it was all to do with modems - check out the FAQ - and nothing to do with naked women.<br>This begged a question or two.<br>It was around the time Telstra was floated. So was the naked woman a way to induce reluctant punters to part with their hard-earned money? No, it was a mums and dads share issue. Naked women might attract a few desperates but it is hardly the sales pitch of a responsible communications carrier.<br>Did a Telstra Net nerd with too much idle time call up the Big Pond HTML code by mistake and insert the young lady and upload her, unknowingly, to the site? Possible, but very unlikely.<br>Did the rude picture escape through a leak in my browser's cache and just coincidentally land on the page? No, though this was suggested by some cruel and heartless person. I swear I'd never seen her before in my life.<br>The next day, naked vision and unanswered questions still buzzing, I was reading a local newsgroup where, shock-horror, a correspondent was telling everyone else to have a look at the naked woman on the Hewlett Packard site.<br>Reply after reply came in suggesting he was mad or on drugs. There was nothing untoward there. But he swore there was a naked woman and he had taken a screenshot and e-mailed HP support.<br>After the welter of disbelieving replies he checked back at the HP site and his naked lady had indeed vanished. He had received a nice reply from HP staff saying they could see nothing - certainly no bare flesh - but they would investigate.<br>He put forward some possible scenarios for the weird happenings. Like me, he ruled out cache leakage, which cruel and heartless people had accused him of as well.<br>His theories: 1. It's something to do with (his and my ISP's) proxy server.<br>2. Aliens have taken over HP's site.<br>3. Crossed wires (received someone else's packets).<br>We were getting nowhere very fast. Two other users reported similar happenings and put it down to possible mix-ups of data packets at their proxy servers.<br>No one really knew. But one fact remained: we had all met naked women when we least expected it.<br>The newsgroup discussion then went sideways - as they nearly always do - about strange practices at some (unnamed) Perth suburban ISPs.<br>For example: ?Did you ever see 150-plus modems transported from an outer suburb to Perth on the back of a trailer, piled on top of each other in a wheelie bin??<br>This conversation seemed more obscene than any talk about naked women.<br>And the reason we saw them? I still don't know but after 15 years lurking on the periphery of the computing world, I would say it definitely has something to do with the little green men inside who make the computer work.<br></font></p>
