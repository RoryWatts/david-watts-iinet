            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">James and the Giant Peach (PG)<br>Paul Terry, Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley; voices of Richard Dreyfuss and Susan Sarandon<br>Directed by Henry Selick<br>? ? ?<br>JAMES and the Giant Peach has much going for it. It is based on one of Roald Dahl's best-loved books, is animated by many of the team who did A Nightmare Before Christmas, and is acted by a stellar cast.<br>But somehow it is not as good as the sum of its parts would indicate. This does not mean it is a bad film for the school holidays; it is one of the best around. However, it might have been so much more magical.<br>It seems affected by the very cleverness that created it, concentrating too much on its brilliant stop-action animation and forsaking the magic of the story.<br>Roald Dahl's story - his first children's book, published in 1961 - has captivated millions and is the 80th most popular book of the century at Waterstone's in London.<br>But the animation, which tops the effort of the acclaimed Nightmare Before Christmas, cannot take the place of imagination.<br>And imagination, dreams and magic are what James and the Giant Peach is all about. Readers have their own image of what this fantastic tale is about. Viewers are presented with a compilation from producer Tim Burton's team. As brilliant as that is, and remember Burton was the man behind Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands, Dahl's tale is probably not the best choice for film. He himself doubted it could be done.<br>Other Dahl stories like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (filmed as Willie Wonka), The Witches and Matilda fare better on celluloid.<br>But to the film itself. The cast is a who's who of character actors. Joanna Lumley of Absolutely Fabulous and Miriam Margolyes are the real-life villains. They are the pantomime-style aunts who ?care? for hero James (Paul Terry) after his idyllic parents are gobbled by a mad rhinoceros in the opening scene.<br>Pete Postlethwaite (from The Name of the Father, The Usual Suspects and Romeo and Juliet) is the mysterious old man who gives James the thousand green, glowing crocodile tongues that James drops near his aunts' barren peach tree, causing the giant peach to balloon in front of their eyes.<br>When James drops another magic crocodile tongue on a piece of peach - he eats it because his aunts serve only fish heads if he is lucky - the animation begins.<br>In the peach live a Brooklyn-born centipede (voice of Richard Dreyfuss), an exotically European spider (Susan Sarandon), a very British grasshopper (Simon Callow), an earthy worm (David Thewlis), a matronly ladybug (Jane Leeves from TV's Frasier) and a dotty glow worm (Margolyes again).<br>James turns from real boy into a puppet and the peach rolls away to adventure, flattening the aunts. The animated crew battles a computer-generated shark and puppet pirates (Jack Skellington from Nightmare makes a cameo appearance) before landing on the Empire State Building.<br>Those who have not read the book will be wide-eyed with pleasure mostly - though some of the action is a bit sleepy and the Randy Newman songs are surprisingly flat. Those who have read James will find new and different images in their own mind.<br></font></p>
