            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE film Elizabeth, starring Australians Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush, has won much critical acclaim. But it mostly has only a nodding acquaintance with the historical facts. One of the immediate after-effects of watching this Godfather-like yarn about the early reign of Queen Elizabeth I is to reach for some reference material to find out more about the Virgin Queen. On the Web you can ignore the facts and dive straight into the sumptuous Elizabeth the Movie site put out by the film's makers.<br>Here you can read the rattling good yarn that makes up the plot and follow links to biographies of the cast and crew.<br>Or if you have had enough of fantasy, and know that William Cecil, the first Baron Burghley, was much younger than the Queen's adviser portrayed by Richard Attenborough in the film, you can hop on a trail of reference sites that are bound to keep you fascinated and intrigued.<br>English history, particularly royal history, is one of the strong areas of the Web.<br>A good place to start any regal quest is Marivi's Royalty page, which has more than 150 links to other sites which deal with royalty.<br>Filipino Marivi Dayrit Magat has put the links under a variety of headings that include genealogy, mixed royal families, personalities, the Windsors and Tudors, the House of Romanov, as well as chatrooms and newsgroups of royal persuasions.<br>Marivi's, therefore, is not just concerned with the British monarchy. It covers, among others, French, Italian, Swedish and even Hawaiian royal families. But if you want to get back to the point - the search for the truth about Elizabeth I - there is plenty to accommodate.<br>The Britannia Internet Magazine has a comprehensive history of every British ruler from the time of the Druids.<br>In there of course is some good reading about Elizabeth. But better is the link to the Directory of Royal Genealogical Data.<br>From here you can wander willy-nilly over the paths of the kings and queens, their offspring and even their lovers.<br>Click on Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII, for instance and you might be surprised to learn that not only did he have six wives, but the first, Catherine of Aragon, had six children. It is very easy to while away a day following the meandering gene pool, but if you need less serious royalty sites, then Marivi's also supplies links to them, as well as the unofficial and fan club sites for all the modern royals.<br>One especially good one is the Royal Network, which allows people to write e-mail messages to royalty. The best are published at the site.<br>For example: ?Hello there sunshine. Do you have any nude photos of the Queen Mum playing cricket? Many thanks, 18 million Australians.? The e-mail is, wisely, unsigned.<br>Links:<br>Elizabeth, the Movie: www.elizabeth-themovie.com<br>Marivi's Royalty Page: www.serv.net/marivim/royalty.html<br>Britannia/British Monarchs: www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/index.html<br>Directory of Royal Genealogical Data: www.dcs.hull.ac.uk/public/genealogy/royal/<br>The Royal Network: www.royalnetwork.com<br></font></p>
