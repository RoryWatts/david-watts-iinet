            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Hamlet is one of Shakespeare's best plays. Its adaptation by British actor Kenneth Branagh is also one of the better movies on in Perth.<br>The excellence of the story of the maddened Prince of Denmark and his bloody revenge for the murder of his father appears to have ignited plenty of passions on the Web too.<br>Those who have seen the film have given it an average 9.2 out of 10 at the Internet Movie Data Base, a repository of information on more than 50,000 movies. Following links from the database, it is possible to enter a world dominated by Hamlet.<br>First stop is the official movie site run by Sony. It tries to ape the sumptuous presentation of Branagh's film, an attempt that can only fail given the presentation differences in media - computer screen vs movie screen.<br>But it is a handsome site, with elegant script for the links and a simple, dramatic use of background - an animated image of Branagh, as Hamlet, leafing through a book.<br>A link called Gambols invites surfers to play little mind games on the set of the movie. For example, they have to find significant items in Hamlet's room and solve a puzzle.<br>There is also a link to information about a CD-ROM game called Elsinore which will ask players to prevent the many deaths in the play.<br>The best link is to Wondrous Places, in reality to other Hamlet sites. These include IPL Shakespeare's Complete Works, Collected Works of Shakespeare, Shakespeare Illustrated, Complete Plays of Shakespeare and the Hamlet Home Page.<br>The Hamlet Home Page is a must-see. It delivers the text of the play, a plot summary, and image galleries of stills from the Branagh and Laurence Olivier versions.<br>HELP DESK<br>Internet Movie DataBase: www.imdb.com<br>Official Hamlet movie site: hamlet-movie.com<br>The Hamlet Home Page: www.hamlet.edmonton.ab.ca<br></font></p>
