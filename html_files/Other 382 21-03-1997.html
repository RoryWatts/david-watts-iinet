            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SCIENTISTS in Japan say they have produced cows from cows ... with no bull. That is, according to London's esteemed Sunday Times, virgin birth is possible. What's more virgin births of females only are now on the cards.<br>The Sunday Times said a Japanese university team had bred calves by doing away with the need for sperm. The team removed unfertilised egg cells from cows and bathed them in alcohol and chemicals which stimulated their development into embryos. These embryos were then returned to the womb.<br>Instead of two sets of chromosomes, one each from the mother and father, they all came from the mother and created only female offspring.<br>Scientists call the technique ?parthenogenesis? - I call it madness.<br>Imagine what the world might come to if this practice was allowed to continue unabated and spread from creating good milkers to creating female humans.<br>For a start there would be no Footy Show on Thursday nights. That is because there almost certainly would be no footy. Girls are good sports, but only blokes could spend more than an hour talking about ruck contests, spiral torps, wrenched groins and courting conquests ... there would be no courting in the traditional Adam-Eve sense either.<br>There would be no romantic films. This genre which includes The English Patient, Pretty Baby and even Four Weddings and a Funeral, would be unnecessary. No blokes, no testosterone, no chemistry, no weepies. There may still be Jaffas - low-fat variety - but they would be consumed while watching goodness-knows-what, perhaps Rosie the Riveter.<br>I assume most pubs would go out of business. However, little cafes which serve sun-dried tomatoes, pasta and decaffeinated, low-fat coffees would thrive. As would any eatery that catered for chatfests and diet-consciousness.<br>Politically correct language would be obsolete after a massive overhaul which deleted manholes, chairmen, hymns and even mankind.<br>Hugging, crying, gossiping, networking and motherhood would all be far more important than aloofness, stiff upper lips, chivalry and intestinal fortitude.<br>Claudia Schiffer, Elle, Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell would no longer be thought desirable. Pants would not require flys. Tie-makers would have to diversify into scarves. Sports commentators would not yell. Members of the armed forces would demand Sunday sleep-ins, which wouldn't matter because a theoretical invading all-woman army would be doing its collective hair the same day.<br>And jokes like the following would be all the rage:<br>Three men are out fishing. Out of the blue, they catch a mermaid who begs to be set free in return for granting each of them a wish.<br>One of the chaps says: ?OK, double my IQ.?<br>The mermaid says: ?Done.?<br>Suddenly, the chap starts reciting Shakespeare flawlessly and analysing it with extreme insight. The second chap is so amazed he says to the mermaid: ?Triple my IQ.? ?Done,? she responds.<br>And suddenly he begins to spout all the mathematical solutions to problems that have been stumping physicists, chemists, biologists, genetic engineers etc.<br>The last man is enthralled, so much that he asks the mermaid to ?quintuple my IQ.? The mermaid pleads: ?I really wish you'd reconsider.?<br>But the man is insistent. ?I want you to increase my IQ times five, and if you don't do it, I won't set you free.?<br>?Please,? says the mermaid ?You don't know what you're asking. It'll change your entire view on the universe.?<br>But he would not be swayed. And the mermaid granted his wish.<br>He turned into a woman.<br>???<br>MOUTHS of babes department: Three different GYMs (gorgeous young mums) told me their children gave the following answers in preschool to the old reliable ?what are you going to be when you grow up??<br>First child (a boy): A dinosaur.<br>Second child (a blond fair-skinned boy): An Aboriginal.<br>Third child (a girl): A woman.<br>Only one gave the correct answer. It had to be the female, right.<br></font></p>
