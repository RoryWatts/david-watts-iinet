            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT MUST be tough being the world's richest man. As hard as that is to believe, consider what is happening to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.<br>Everyone wants a part of him, not just his money but his time.<br>Fortune magazine has estimated Mr Gates' personal wealth at more than $80 billion. With rises in Microsoft's share price, this has undoubtedly grown.<br>Such wealth led US consumer advocate Ralph Nader late last month to suggest to Mr Gates that he and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett should be doing more to help their fellow man.<br>Letters on the World Wide Web between Mr Nader and Mr Gates spell out the situation eloquently.<br>On July 27, Mr Nader told Mr Gates that the Seattle software king's income was greater than the combined net worth of the poorest 40 per cent of Americans - 106 million people.<br>Their wealth - or lack of it - was calculated by including their home equity, pensions and mutual funds.<br>Mr Nader wrote: ?As might be expected, on a worldwide plane, wealth disparities are staggering. According to the United Nations Development Program, the assets of the world's 358 billionaires were greater than the combined incomes of countries with 45 per cent of the world's people (about 3 billion human beings).<br>?Let me suggest that you team up with (Warren Buffett) ... to sponsor, plan and lead a conference of billionaires and multi-billionaires on the subject of national and global wealth disparities and what to do about it.<br>?With the dual sweep of the Gates-Buffett hands, the serious and consequential plight of humanity would become a matter of high alert for those business colleagues and acquaintances of yours who aspire to move from success to significance.?<br>Last Tuesday, Mr Gates replied that he was delighted Mr Nader shared his personal interest in philanthropy and emphasised a well-publicised statement that he (Mr Gates) intended to give away the bulk of his wealth during his working life.<br>As an example, Mr Gates said he had endowed two foundations with more than $1.5 billion already. He also cited his Gates Library Foundation, which aims to allow all Americans, regardless of income or social status, Internet access at public libraries.<br>?I do encourage everyone I know to participate in philanthropy,? Mr Gates said. ?However, philanthropy is very personal. I think people should give because they want to give, and not because of pressure from a conference or anyone who claims they have all the answers in this area.?<br>Mr Nader responded last week that Mr Gates had missed the point about a conference of the wealthy on fairer distribution.<br>There is bound to be more, but the score seems locked at 15-all for the moment.<br>This argument about what to do with the Gates fortune is not restricted to the powerful like Mr Nader.<br>At the resourceful Unofficial Bill Gates Page, a link leads to a forum where the subject is open for discussion among average Netizens. The suggestions are many, varied and colourful.<br>One says Mr Gates should form an army and take over a Third World country ?like any dictator?.<br>Others include:<br>??I think that Bill Gates should give me $10,000 for my 17th birthday in July so I can buy a car.?<br>? ?Share it with struggling individuals like myself. I'm not asking for much. $50,000 would help me to get out of debt and start my own business.?<br>? ?Bill Gates should help out with training for single mothers who find it impossible to pay for a Microsoft training.?<br>? ?Give it all to me, you (expletive deleted).?<br>? ?Maybe he could buy a football team or two. Heck why not buy the NFL??<br>Actually there are many sensible, thoughtful suggestions too. All in all a wonderful example of how the Net can focus energies on a problem ... as long as it is to do with someone else's money.<br>Help Desk<br>Nader letter to Gates:<br>www.essential.org/antitrust/<br>ms/rn2bg7-27.html<br>Gates reply:<br>www.essential.org/<br>antitrust/ms/bg2rn-8-4.html<br>Gates Library Foundation:<br>www.glf.org<br>Unofficial Bill Gates Page:<br>www.zpub.com/un/bill/<br>What Gates should do with his money:<br>www.greenspun.com/bboard/<br>q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?<br>msg_id=0<br></font></p>
