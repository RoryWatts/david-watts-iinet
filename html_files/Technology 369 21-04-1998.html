            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Microsoft Outlook 98<br>E-mail and personal management<br>Developer: Microsoft<br>Platform: Windows95 and NT<br>RRP: Free download until June 30; after that $169<br>Outlook 98 is another whopping piece of Microsoft software, weighing in at as much as 32Mb when downloaded from the Web. But it is not bloatware, the derogatory term used so often when talking about some Microsoft products that are big on bytes but short of real bite.<br>It is primarily an e-mail client, taking the place of the unsatisfactory Outlook 97, MS Exchange or even the speedy and effective Outlook Express.<br>A 32Mb e-mail client might sound over the top, when compared with the slim simplicity of Eudora or Pegasus. But Outlook 98 offers more than the ability to send and receive or organise addresses. It has a calendar that can be displayed in several ways - one day at a time, working week, normal week, month - and on which events can be entered with an alarm that will ring at a pre-determined time as a reminder. Recurring events can be configured so they only have to be entered once.<br>It has a journal that can keep a record of whatever you want and by several different methods. For example, you can ask the journal to record automatically all the e-mails you send to a certain address - good for keeping track of work-related correspondence.<br>It has the ability to post little notes - or stickies - on your screen or those of other network users.<br>Outlook 98 is another example of Microsoft's continuing integration of products into a web-style view, best exemplified by Internet Explorer 4.0. In fact, users have to install IE 4.0 or update to the latest version for Outlook 98 to work.<br>A big web-style innovation is the Outlook Today page, an uncluttered at-a-glance display of upcoming appointments, unfinished tasks and unread Inbox messages. You just click on a hyperlink to jump to the corresponding Outlook module.<br>Outlook's interface is sleek and streamlined. Menu choices are fairly uncomplicated, although if you are upgrading from the snazzy Outlook Express that came with the original IE 4.0, some features like signatures and e-mail threads are less than obvious or appear to be missing.<br>The Web integration is not the only feature Outlook has in common with IE 4.0. It likes to take over all Net business as well.<br>E-mail and addresses from Eudora and Netscape are imported and converted to Microsoft format easily. This is an area where Microsoft is somewhat of a bully. Its proprietary format barely allows similar importing and conversion to other programs.<br>Still, it is a useful facility, especially if you want Outlook 98 and its bells and whistles as your default mailer. Some critics savaged Outlook 97 for making e-mail handling an afterthought. But 98 shines as a stand-alone mail client for dial-up accounts.<br>It supports the alphabet soup of Internet standards, including IMAP4, NNTP, POP3 and SMTP; S/MIME lets you send and receive secure mail and, thanks to LDAP support, you can find e-mail addresses using public and private directory servers.<br>Preview panes, junk-mail filters and wizards for setting filtering rules add to a thoroughly good product that recently topped a comparison of e-mail clients by the editors of cnet. Other mailers tested were Eudora Pro 4, Outlook Express and Netscape Messenger.<br>That choice for review sends out the serious message that the days of single, specialised mail programs - or any Net-related programs for that matter - are becoming numbered.<br>The Web integration of Microsoft Internet Explorer and rival Netscape Communicator has shifted the goalposts to favour the big boys.<br></font></p>
