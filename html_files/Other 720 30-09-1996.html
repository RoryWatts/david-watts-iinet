            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS is essentially a private matter but has to be raised because it is so worrying. The other day I was answering a call of nature and noticed little green, flickering lights.<br>The public amenity I was in was not being captured by aliens as far as I know, so I investigated further. The little lights were at eye-height and located in a little plastic container that had ?electronic device? written all over it.<br>Not literally written all over it but you could tell by looking that this loo was being controlled by some gadgetry. The handwritten sign next to the plastic device told all: ?Auto-Flush,? it said.<br>Indeed when my business was finished the loo did auto-flush. I didn't have to lift a finger.<br>But, and here is the worrying part, how did it know I was finished? What invention of a brilliant and twisted mind makes it possible to ascertain an individual's waste quotient and flush it away on cue?<br>There are so many variables in this exercise. I could have lingered at a bar and been busting; I could have been about to go on a three-hour trip and wanted to make sure that no call of nature interrupted the journey; I could have had a normal amount of liquid and therefore a normal requirement to flush it.<br>But how does this auto-flushing brain of the loo know what my normal requirement is as opposed to say a five-year-old child's, or a hulking 200cm tall, 110kg person?<br>The fate of those entering that loo is wrapped up in a blinking green light. Are there people behind the light, watching every move, and do they pull an old-fashioned chain when time's up?<br>Or, as is the case with so-called sophisticated gadgetry, does the plastic device just guess and flush when it feels like it? You could be halfway through a relieving exercise when .. . gush, out comes the flusherloo.<br>Or you could be well finished and nothing happens. In which case you head home with your mum's voice ringing in your ears from years ago: ?Did you flush it??<br>Oh the guilt. And what if the power fails; is there a manual back-up? I saw no buttons to push and no chain to pull.<br>Loos have been getting more and more sophisticated for many years now, ever since the automatic hand-drier was thought of. And whoever thought of it laughed all the way to the bank and got quickly away to somewhere without hand-driers and where no one would ever find them.<br>They make noise but do not dry. The best advice I saw was pencilled on one machine in similar typographic style to the instructions, so if you were a little misty-eyed you could think it was official.<br>?Hold hands under drier. Rub well. Dry hands on pants,? is what the instructions read.<br>In Bali there was a loo so sophisticated you could watch videos while standing to attention. The loo would then auto-flush. There were no taps at the hand-basins, just nozzles. No fear, the water jetted out when you put your hands under the nozzle and turned off when you withdrew.<br>The hand-drier seemed positively steam-driven by comparison.<br>I still wiped my hands on my pants.<br>???<br>HEADLINE news: These newspaper headings will not win awards, but they are hard to beat for honesty.
