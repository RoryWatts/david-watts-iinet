            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN whimsical moments the boss of this section, David Utting, likes to ask: ?Do you think this Internet thingy will catch on??<br>He is joking of course ... at least I hope so.<br>This Internet thingy has caught on so much that at least 5.5 million Australians are among more than 210 million worldwide to have used it.<br>Rather than asking whether it will catch on, it is perhaps more appropriate to ask what its main use will be, now that it has made such inroads.<br>Media stereotyping has not helped answer this question.<br>In the beginning, say two or three years ago, the focus seemed to be on the dark side. The Net was equated with pornography, hate sites and bomb recipes.<br>Indeed you can still almost guarantee that TV newsreaders will add the words ?made with instructions freely available on the Internet? when they mention ?home-made bomb?.<br>One day someone will say Jim Smith baked a cake with a recipe found on the Internet and there could be outrage.<br>The stereotype confusing the picture now is that the Net, through e-commerce, will somehow be the saviour of capitalism and mankind in general. But that is taking it too far, especially at this early stage.<br>Net commentator Jon Casimir pointed out on Saturday that, though the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed more than 40 per cent of Australians had tried the Net by May this year, only 650,000 had used it to buy or order goods and services, making a total of three million orders or purchases.<br>Nearly 90 per cent of online Australia was not using e-commerce, he argued. The fact that e-commerce may have doubled since the ABS released its figures, and might even double again over Christmas, did not change the fact that the online population saw the Net as a useful tool and even plaything for many more reasons than shopping.<br>The Net obviously is a commercial arena, and can enhance a few otherwise drab chores such as bill paying and buying goods from catalogues.<br>B UT most users see more value in the Net's political, social, cultural and personal sides.<br>A simple illustration: if you type the words Star Wars in a search engine such as Google you will be rewarded with more than 27,000 matches.<br>It may only be popular culture, but this forbidding amount of information shows a lot of people have been busy writing, editing, creating and thinking.<br>Oh, of course there are links to Star Wars goods and e-commerce sites, but they are not the main reason such pages exist.<br>The ability to communicate quickly with people from anywhere still far outweighs the ability to buy goods without looking the seller in the face.<br></font></p>
