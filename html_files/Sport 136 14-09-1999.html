            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT on television is like valium for many. It soothes the pain of real life.<br>For the past two years, West Coast fans dejected by unflattering early exits from the finals, have at least been able to wallow in Patrick Rafter's victories at the US Open.<br>Those looking for similar pain relief on Saturday after Carlton's surprising demolition job might have turned to the Test cricket in Sri Lanka if they had Foxtel.<br>Then they would have turned back - and quickly - at the sight of Sri Lanka's historic three-day win courtesy of poor Aussie batting and highlighted by the sickening collision between Steve Waugh and Jason Gillespie.<br>As they were reaching for the razor blades to do themselves in, they might have discovered a sudden affinity with Brisbane and cheered on a non-Victorian outfit with genuine premiership hopes.<br>But no matter where the dejected Eagle fan looked, the truth was out there ... as they say in the X-Files.<br>It was a moist-eyed, emotional truth too. Far from a pain soother, it was a gut-wrencher.<br>And it had nothing to do with the Eagles' inability to control the midfield or hit targets in the forward line, or to make Craig Bradley act his real age.<br>It was all about Mick Malthouse and what became his last acts as Eagles coach.<br>The three-quarter time embrace of Glen Jakovich; the after-game straight-backed march from the box to be with his players; the straight look into the eyes, many of them reddened; the firm handshakes; the pats on the back and heads; the arm around a few shoulders, and the hugs of both Guy McKenna and David Wirrpunda.<br>This was real life, real emotion, as up close and personal as anything seen on TV, certainly in the field of sport and certainly in the wake of a very ordinary loss.<br>Basil's Footy Show took the anguish a step further on Sunday with its images of an emotionally devastated Daniel Metropolis in the change rooms after the match.<br>Also top TV was Malthouse's from-the-heart press conference in which he spoke of the difficulty in cutting his ties with the club.<br>?A new group of kids come through and I get attached to them,? he said. ?Where do you draw the line? When do you break the umbilical cord? It's hard enough with these two (Jakovich and McKenna).<br>?I treat this bloke (Jakovich) like a son ... where do you cut the line? You have to do it at some stage.?<br>The Malthouse exit showed how sport is not about one match. It is, as he said, about the entire journey, a ?journey (that) takes you down some great tracks?.<br>We will see Malthouse on TV next year of course. And we may not like what we see. He is almost certain to be coaching Collingwood and offering his straight-shooting wisdom to Channel McGuire ... ah, sorry, 9.<br>But we will at least have the memories of last weekend when he gave all football viewers a lesson in how to approach life with honesty and passion.<br></font></p>
