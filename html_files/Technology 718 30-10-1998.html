            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THEY do things very differently in London. No Richard Court bell towers costing a few measly million for them, no sir. To celebrate the new millennium, London is getting a giant dome complete with an exhibition of nearly every facet of the human experience, all for a knock-down price of just over $2 billion.<br>The main difference between the millennium monuments of WA and London is that their huge dome will not cost taxpayers a penny. Our needle-sharp bell tower by the Swan is a Government initiative, for which read: we pay for it.<br>Another big difference is that anyone with a computer and Internet connection can have a look at what $2 billion buys you.<br>I am talking about virtual rather than real inspections, of course.<br>On the Web you can configure your browser to take a 3-D tour of London's Millennium Dome at the home of time in Greenwich.<br>A plug-in called Viscape is needed to take the virtual tour. It weighs in at 5.5Mb and takes about 25 minutes to download and install on an average 28.8K connection.<br>Once on your system, it allows you to fly over the dome, approach it on foot, by boat, or even in a London taxi.<br>What you see is a bit cartoonish at first. But if you read all the accompanying information at the Millennium Experience site, you quickly appreciate that the dome is a wonder of the modern world.<br>It will occupy space at Greenwich which is the equivalent of 13 Royal Albert Halls or two Wembley Stadiums.<br>Inside is the Millennium Experience, claimed to be the planet's biggest shared celebration of the year 2000.<br>The promoters claim it will be ?the most visited, the most exciting, the most life-transforming event marking the start of the third millennium?.<br>The exhibition is expected to draw 12 million real people when it opens on December 31, 1999. Its displays will remain open until the dawn of the millennium on January 1, 2001.<br>For those of us who expect to make only a virtual visit, the Millennium Experience still has much to offer.<br>Apart from the 3-D tour of the huge exterior, you can look at pictures and videos of the project or preview many of the exhibition centres. Web surfers can visit seven of the 14 exhibition zones now. All will be available in the coming months.<br>Among displays are:<br>lThe Mind - where you can discover creative power;<br>lThe Body - a giant ?human machine? designed to show how every part of us works;<br>lWork - an area to match your skills with the world of work expected next century;<br>lPlay - where you can find out how leisure can re-activate life.<br>The Experience is being paid for with a combination of Lottery (like our Lotto) funds, sponsorship money, and income that it will generate itself.<br>The Web site gives details and promises that events will be so well organised there will be none of one famous London tradition . . . the queue.<br>Link:<br>www.dome2000.co.uk<br></font></p>
