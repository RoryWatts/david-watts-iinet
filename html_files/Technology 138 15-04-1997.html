            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT'S Internet Explorer 4.0 is meant for developers and experienced users only at this stage. Microsoft makes that clear at its download site.<br>But judging by how hard it is to get to that site and the growing number of comments in newsgroups, many people are trying out the exciting new program.<br>Microsoft makes its warning because MSIE 4.0 is not even in beta release and could be prone to bugs, lock-ups and crashes. That has certainly been the case with Netscape Communicator's pre-release. A third, less buggy version appeared last week.<br>But WestWeb has had a smooth ride with the preview release. There have been two or three lock-ups on the Web, but no general protection faults or total freezes yet.<br>The reaction from HotWired's columnist was: ?Internet Explorer 4.0 is good software. Really good. Way better than Netscape. I suspect a lot of reviewers will be apologising for their good reviews.?<br></font></p>
