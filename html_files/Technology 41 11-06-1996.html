            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHIC rhymes with geek and there is now a World Wide Web move to find just how trendy Netizens have become.<br>The geekchic site in the US offers a 20-question quiz for surfers to find out whether they are drones, geeks or, the ultimate, geek chic.<br>Only those who can use Java with their browsers need bother ... this is how geeky you have to be just to get in the front door.<br>Mind you, the preponderance of new Net users with Windows95 and Netscape 2.0 or above actually means there could be more than a few ?newbies? stumbling on the geekchic quiz.<br>Surfers are asked to select one of three descriptions best describing their lifestyle and to click on that option.<br>The selection prompts a sign that flashes on the screen, saying either ?drone?, ?geek? or ?geek chic?.<br>At the bottom of the screen a line moves from ?drone? to ?geek chic?, depending on the answers.<br>For example the surfer is asked to nominate one of the following three as a turn-on:<br>?An IBM Thinkpad (response - geek).<br>? Sharon Stone or Mel Gibson (drone).<br>? An IBM Thinkpad on the laps of either Sharon Stone or Mel Gibson (geek chic).<br>It never gets more complicated than that.<br>http://www.geekchic.com/michael.htm<br></font></p>
