            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">1995 was undoubtedly the year of Netscape.<br>The browser program became essential software for anyone wanting to connect to the exploding World Wide Web on the Internet.<br>Perth access providers were supplying version 1.1 of Netscape as late as July and August to new Net users. Now version 1.22 seems standard issue.<br>Version 2.0, in beta release 3, is available for download and trial all over the Web. There are quick download points in Perth that take a lot of the boredom out of copying the 2MB program.<br>Moore's law, which says computer power will double every 18 months, has made home computer users big winners.<br>Many now have as much or more computing power than their office mainframes did only five years ago. A 540MB hard disk and 8MB of RAM are now standard.<br>Pentium processors, 1GB disks and at least 16MB of RAM look to be standard in 1996.<br>These improvements, plus Netscape's harnessing of the powerful Java software which will allow almost immediate access to multimedia anywhere on the Web, make Netscape look just about untouchable.<br>Netscape was the darling of the stockmarket when floated in the second half of the year. The small-time shareware program rocketed to a household name and made its originator Marcus Andreessen a rich man.<br>It rattled the Windows at Microsoft, spoiling what had been a good year with the much hyped launch of Windows 95.<br>Netscape has grown in importance so much that industry observers are saying it will be a computer interface standard that goes far beyond access to the World Wide Web. It is anticipated by the end of 1996 it will be the main way to read any complex documents.<br>Encyclopedia Britannica already publishes a CD-ROM version of its encyclopedia using Netscape to navigate through the information hierarchies.<br>Netscape literacy could become as important as Windows literacy in using a computer.<br>Users will have a logical and graphically comprehensible way to surf a massive text for what they want.<br>Mr Andreessen says Netscape now knows that more than 10 million people have accessed the Netscape home page on the Web ... the sort of data he did not have with his Mosaic browser.<br>?We know that that is only a part of the overall world of Netscape users because many Netscape users are on internal networks in government or corporations that don't have access to the outside Internet,? he said.<br>Mr Andreessen said in the interview that Netscape's secret was that it was in the middle of an exploding market.<br>?If you're in a market that's exploding 1000 per cent a year - which is the one we're in, give or take - the demand for software in this market is just going through the roof,? Mr Andreessen said.<br>?In that phase, the safest thing to do is to try to do as much as you can to knock down barriers to people buying your stuff.<br>?Buyers in this case are looking for vendors who adopt local standards and support them. They're looking for vendors who are reliable, who provide them with support, who have a vision for the future and a vision of where things are going. That's what we're trying to do - our secret, our strategy, is to execute well.?<br>These words are ominous given that they come from a 24-year-old self-confessed geek, who is just starting to learn about boardrooms and meetings.<br></font></p>
