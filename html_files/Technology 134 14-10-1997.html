            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Microsoft's latest Web browser is now weighing down millions of hard drives across the world after only a couple of weeks on release.<br>Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 is causing one of the biggest fusses seen on the Web since the battle of the browsers in September last year.<br>More than a million copies of the software that makes Windows 95 operate like it's part of the Web were downloaded within 48 hours of release on October 1, according to the Seattle giant.<br>MS officials estimated six copies a second were being loaded from dozens of sites around the world, making it the company's most popular software.<br>User reaction has been mixed but a majority seems to like the big program, judging by comments in newsgroups.<br>Those who like it have praised it for its ease of customisation, true full-screen browsing, treating the operating system like the Web, a good mail and news client and, above all, its speed.<br>Critics say it is intrusive, reconfigures the operating system, unwieldy, gimmicky and slow. Most critics have also decried the heavy promotion of channels, which they say takes away easy, random browsing to replace it with corporate-driven advertising.<br>Software library TUCOWS (The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software) is advising people that the minimum requirements for the new Explorer are Win95 or NT, a 66Mhz processor, 8Mb of RAM for 95, 16Mb for NT, and 50Mb of hard disk space. ?It is recommended that the user have at least a Pentium 133 with 32Mb of RAM,? TUCOWS said.<br>Versions for Win 3.x and the Mac are expected in three to four months and Unix users will have to wait a month or two even longer.<br>The most popular version of Explorer downloaded so far is the Standard, which weighs in at 16.6Mb unzipped and takes between 30 and 35Mb on your hard disk.<br>The full version, which includes Internet collaboration and Web authoring tools, is 24Mb.<br>Beta versions have been available since early this year but users who have experienced those and the official version report a world of difference, notably in stability.<br>The most striking feature of Explorer is its ability to function as the shell for the operating system.<br>This is optional but takes away any pretence that it is simply a browser suite like arch-rival Netscape Communicator 4.0.<br>Users can configure their PCs so that one click of the mouse will activate applications. The pointer is the familiar hand seen when browsing the Web.<br>Folders, documents and programs can all look like underlined Web sites. Folders can be viewed as HTML documents with additional information thrown in and even backgrounds and images.<br>By typing a Web address in the folder/browser window, the toolbar changes to a Web browser's and the change from OS to Web is reasonably painless, giving the feeling of one integrated computing experience. Once on the Web, users can operate in true full-screen mode. Only a small browser toolbar interferes with the view of pages.<br>Channels are the alleged big selling point of Explorer. MS has given Australians their own set of information providers such as the ABC, the Australian, Fairfax and Channel 9.<br>By choosing one of these channels, users can have automatically updated Web pages sent to their hard disk for offline browsing.<br>The Web integration of Explorer is one of the big debating points on the Net.<br>US information and software specialist cnet asked people whether they would use the full shell view of Explorer and did they favour such integration.Early responses had 59 per cent of people against and 41 per cent in favour.<br>A no voter wrote: ?I just wanted a browser. What does wanting to look at Web pages with the latest tech have to do with changing my perfectly working Windows??<br>Readers in favour of a seamless interface felt total integration between all applications was inevitable.<br></font></p>
