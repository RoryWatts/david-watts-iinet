            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Web has not taken long to lose its gloss. In less than two years the biggest up-front sites have opted to become ugly, text-filled pages that ape telephone directories.<br>Go to Telstra BigPond's home, or Excite Australia, ninemsn, certainly Yahoo - they all have that dull but worthy look. It is the look of the portal site. Depending on how you want to view things, portals are either the greatest form of mind control invented, or the handiest help at navigating the Web possible.<br>On any given day I am prepared to accept either argument, as well as the many shades of grey in between.<br>For example, I could easily decry portal sites as a way for big companies, such as Channel 9 and Microsoft through ninemsn, to confine the entire surfing experience to sites run by them and their associates.<br>Ninemsn will direct me to Microsoft Hotmail, Dolly magazine, and Channel 9 shows such as 60 Minutes or the Footy Show. But no one dictates that I have to follow these navigation paths. If I was watching TV and did not like what was on Nine I would simply change channels.<br>On the Web it is even easier plus there are millions of choices.<br>Internet expert Jesse Berst of Ziff Davis Publishing recently raised the fear that portal sites were taking over home pages and thereby robbing users of their surfing freedom.<br>He opened the subject up for responses and was told, quite forcefully, by dozens of his readers he was wrong.<br>Even if portal home pages were trying to direct users down set paths that would result in commercial gain for the proprietors, users had a very easy way out - they could simply change their home page.<br>Quite right too. While arguments such as Mr Berst's look plausible, they ignore one basic tenet the Internet is teaching us every day - it is a medium where the user can reign.<br>This point was hammered home last week at the Netmedia conference in London which featured an online media round table of European journalists, a cyber law lecture, a digital-TV conference, and the presentation of the UK's first online journalism awards.<br>The message from the conference was that the medium was controlled by its users. Traditional media had to learn from the Internet experience where ?people's journalism? was becoming popular.<br>As one speaker noted: ?We don't control our users, they'll go where they want, when they want, and it's now our job to take them there.?<br>Far from always being big, bad thought controllers, portal sites can even be helpful.<br>Lately I have been experimenting with Excite Australia's version which allows a great deal of user customisation. At a mouse click I can read my horoscope, check the weather forecasts in nominated cities, display the top five news stories in four different categories, view my evening TV program guide, and have constantly updated displays of selected share prices.<br>That's great, but a whiff of paranoia persists. Is Excite trying to make me happy so I will be easier to control?<br>If it is, the remedy is simple - build my own home page with basic HTML. Then I can foist it on others and control what they see ...<br></font></p>
