            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet body Electronic Frontiers Australia has attracted flak from some Net users for comments on the restriction of free speech in its annual report circulated recently to newsgroups.<br>In a section discussing the G7 (group of seven industrialised nations) calls to clamp on Net use for publication of material that could support terrorism, the EFA said the comments were ?another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of speech in electronic networks?.<br>?The "offensive' material being targeted is no different from similar material available in libraries and bookshops. What is legal offline must also be legal online,? EFA's report said. But a student at the Australian National University in Canberra responded: ?In Australia, bomb making info like the G7 is concerned about is illegal, as is advocating drug use, as is sexually explicit video material in all but one State. This stupid phrase is completely worthless in Australian jurisdiction.?<br>The full thread of the report and comments is available in the newsgroups aus.org.efa and aus.org.waia (WA Internet Association).<br>The G7 proposals are on the World Wide Web at: www.efc.ca/pages/doc/g7.html<br></font></p>
