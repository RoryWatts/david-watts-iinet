            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE EXPECT too much from our sportsmen and women a lot of the time.<br>In return, they can expect too much of themselves.<br>Prime examples on TV screens in the past week have been Davis Cup linchpin Pat Rafter and St Kilda star Robert Harvey.<br>Rafter, gripped by a virus, threw his all into trying to beat Zimbabwe's Byron Black at Mildura.<br>He failed, had to withdraw from the reverse singles, and, probably as a direct result, Australia was tossed out of a contest it was assumed it would win easily.<br>Brownlow medallist Harvey has a reputation for running opponents so far into the ground that they become physically ill.<br>He cracked ribs in round one, but still turned up for the clash with a presumably shaky Essendon at the MCG on Sunday.<br>No contest. The Saints were thrashed.<br>The Bombers looked premiership material, celebrating nearly every one of their 28 goals with ecstatic little leaps and punches in the air.<br>The cameras lingered on Harvey quite a bit, showing an obviously uncomfortable player unable to exert his usual influence.<br>As a nation of watchers, we expect a lot of people like Rafter and Harvey.<br>We now expect our Test cricket team, for example, to win every series, and ignore the fact that Mark Taylor, Shane Warne, Steve Waugh et al barely have two weeks off in a row to get their minds and bodies together, before preparing for the next contest in which the TV networks will exhibit them as modern-day gladiators.<br>We expect Perth Glory to be a finalist in Ericsson Cup soccer because TV constantly shows images of big, excited crowds going ga-ga over Glory goals.<br>Well, the Glory's okay, but not up to it just yet.<br>We used to expect Perth Wildcats to win every NBL game at the Entertainment Centre.<br>Then the TV cameras moved off them and we did not really know what to expect.<br>The latest move by Channel 7 to bring some Wildcats action into WA homes because the ABC has to service a wider interest in its Sunday basketball telecasts, has coincided with a resurgence by Ricky Grace and the boys.<br>We expect West Coast to win well at Subiaco.<br>Those expectations can make an Eagles crowd more demanding than Mick Malthouse.<br>When Collingwood showed some fight in the third quarter last Friday night, reducing the awesome-looking Eagles lead to five goals, more than a few in the crowd started to abuse the Pies or hold their heads in worry.<br>We expect Fremantle to entertain us and scrape to exciting victories.<br>Well, sometimes our expectations can be just too great.<br>But we can still expect the TV stations to hype next Sunday's western derby.<br>Expect it to end in tears.<br></font></p>
