            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONLY one record remains to be broken ... the annoyingly catchy There's Only One Tony Lockett.<br>Perhaps the words can be changed to reflect other dramas.<br>For a start we could have There's Only One Tony Modra.<br>The Fremantle full forward's 10-goal haul and Daniel Bandy's brilliant ruck work against Melbourne's Jeff White were enough to bring Friday night alive.<br>But there was more. The Dockers' demolition of the Demons by 54 points was not only significant for being the team's first victory at the MCG. It also showed why Dennis Cometti has so much faith in the enigmatic Clive Waterhouse.<br>Waterhouse is one of the few players over whom Cometti loses his objectivity. He even calls him ?Clive?.<br>Waterhouse bustled all over the half forward line as usual on Friday night. But this time he kicked straight.<br>It was an effort that made one think well of Terry Wheeler and Peter Landy ... and even the umpires.<br>How about another song ... There's Only One Scotty Cummings?<br>Unfortunately, the words were too true at Subiaco Oval on Sunday.<br>Cummings and his little mate, Phil Matera, kicked all of West Coast's goals as the team appeared to be mesmerised by a fighting Carlton and some - to be kind - strange umpiring.<br>When Ashley McIntosh was denied either a mark or free kick early in the last quarter, Guy McKenna, Glen Jakovich and company hung their heads and slumped like the Dockers once did.<br>Even Cometti and John Worsfold lost their usual calm outlook in the commentary box.<br>There's Only One Tony Liberatore - Channel 7 replayed the footage of his high tackle on Brisbane's Craig McRae so many times on Saturday night that one has to assume even Blind Freddy can now tell the little Bulldog has a deformity that turns his hand into a claw when it is placed on an opponent's face.<br>Overseas, they are singing There's Only One Martina Hingis (and thank goodness for that).<br>Foxtel viewers had the chance to be appalled by the Swiss teenager's arrogant and petulant behaviour in the French Open on Saturday night.<br>Viewers who just wanted to give the spoilt brat a good hiding were relieved that Steffi Graf did it for them.<br>Hingis might have been taught a tennis lesson, but after reading her after-match comments, it is doubtful she learnt anything about life.<br>?I don't think my behaviour was too bad today,? the 18-year-old said.<br>?When I play it looks so easy. It's not like Monica, who is so strong, or Steffi, always running around. I basically can do whatever I want with the ball.?<br>And how about There's Only One Paul Reiffel?<br>The Australian's return from deep third man, late in India's World Cup innings, killed a pigeon in flight. It gave new meaning to the term deadly accuracy.<br>Now all Reiffel has to do is knock over some rabbits from Zimbabwe and South Africa.<br></font></p>
