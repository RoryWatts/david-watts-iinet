            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHEN I grow up I want to be a healthy eight or nine-year-old boy. There are a zillion reasons for this, but number one is that you have the chance to stop aliens from invading Earth.<br>That is my observation anyway. Where those of us in the late 30s and beyond age bracket spent their boyhoods galloping around on pretend horses, making clicking noises with mouths and rounding up assorted Indians, robbers, rustlers and other varmints; today's boys can sit in front of screens and annihilate threats to mankind by dexterous movements of keys, buttons or joysticks.<br>This is a good thing too. If Australia is ever under threat it would be well to have thousands of joystick-ready computer jocks to zap the baddies. The cowboys of yore would not stand a chance.<br>By the way there are also some non-boys spending their girlhoods in this new and exciting pastime. I didn't really take much notice when I was eight, but I think girls then did a lot of dollies and nursies stuff, practising on smaller siblings, cats and dogs so they would be primed when one of the boys grew up and rode a pretend white charger in to sweep them off their feet.<br>But boys seldom grow up. Our eight-year-olds tinker with joysticks, Nintendo etc, while their dads dominate remote controls, VCRs, power windows and mini hi-fi systems.<br>There are many other reasons to be an eight-year-old boy. Again from pure observation here is a look at what might be their typical day:<br>6.30am: Bound out of bed. Head straight for Nintendo after leaving toilet seat up. Rescue damsel in distress and kill 10-eyed, multi-armed, teeth-gnashing monster from Mars a few hundred times.<br>7am: Have breakfast made and served by adoring parent. Don't notice because mutant Martian now has own TV show. Slop down Vita Brits, toast and whatever else is handy.<br>7.30am: Tease sister by hiding all her schoolclothes. Throw on shorts, shirt and sandals. Get them dirty immediately by doing Gladiator impersonations off the front veranda.<br>8.15am: To school. There's Nick, Dan, Jack, Jock and Jake. Play cricket, take 14 for 5, make 300. Bell rings.<br>9am: Teacher is fuming for some reason. Stop playing cricket and go to classroom.<br>9-11am: Bit boring, just school stuff. 150 per cent for maths.<br>11am: Play lunch. Swap sprout and tomato sandwiches for packet of chips and Mars bar. Got to have health food. Chase girls round oval.<br>11.15-12.30pm: Just school stuff. Paint girl's chair. Thought it was funny. She cried. Thought that was funny too.<br>12.30-1.15pm: More chips, chocolate and a nourishing Fanta. More cricket. More chasing.<br>1.15-3.15pm: More school - it never ends. Look up rude words in dictionary then write them on girl's exercise book.<br>3.15pm-5pm: Cricket, swim, ride, skateboard, Nintendo, biscuits, soft drink, settle in front of TV.<br>5-6pm: Tease sister about having boyfriend. Secretly go into her room and take all her undies to laundry basket. She will be peeved.<br>6-7pm: Tea and TV at same time. Tease dog ... who's he going to tell.<br>7-7.10pm: Homework. It's so easy, except who made the rule you have to spell refrigerator that way. Do it own way ... frijarayta (that's how it should be).<br>7.10-8.30pm: Ask for Terminator from the video store. One day parents will say yes. Won't tire; have only asked 450 times so far. Make new Christmas list, only 10 months to go and Santa could be real.<br>8.30pm: Dream of Martian monsters. Last thing heard is screams of sister who can't find undies.<br>???<br>FOR those who took part in last week's mathematical quiz, there was no absolutely correct answer. However, a grey elephant from Denmark was the most popular.<br>There were also brown or black echidnas from Denmark, varying hued emus, also from Denmark and even a brown eel from ... Denmark.<br>Don't worry if you got a tartan jaguar from Djibouti or a multi-coloured ocelot from the Dominican Republic; they were right, too.<br>But, if like some I know, you got a moose from America or newt from Antigua, then you're mathematically challenged.<br></font></p>
