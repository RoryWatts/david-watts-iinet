            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE nation's one million Internet users are unlikely to face heavy-handed Government intervention after the release yesterday of the Australian Broadcasting Authority's recommendations on regulating online services. Federal Communications and Arts Minister Richard Alston accepted the report's findings and said he would move quickly to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to implement the recommendations.<br>The report recommended that Australia's Internet industry develop a code of practice, form an industry body to deal with the code and user complaints, regulate itself and put into place self-screening methods so parents and other adults could block access to objectionable material.<br>Senator Alston's stance appeared to dent severely State attempts to censor cyberspace.<br>The NSW Government has caused an outcry among users by planning to introduce heavy fines and jail terms for people who allowed unsuitable material on the Internet.<br>The plans, to be presented as an attempt at national legislation, are scheduled to be put before State attorneys-general on Thursday.<br>But Senator Alston told the Internet Industry Association of Australia yesterday that he wanted State governments to be involved in implementing the recommendations because he believed both levels of government had the same goals.<br>?We stated that we are mindful of the dangers of heavy-handed regulation discouraging innovative content and access providers,? Senator Alston said.<br>?The Government is committed to the establishment of a practical and workable system and is not of the view that criminal sanctions should be the critical component of a wider national framework.?<br>One of the reasons for the ABA inquiry into online services was an outcry about the availability of undesirable material such as pornography, racist slurs and guides on how to make bombs or commit suicide.<br>The ABA found that available self-censoring software and parental supervision could play a big part in stopping children accessing such material.<br>It also proposed a labelling scheme be developed to interact with software and block questionable Net sites.<br>The report said the Platform for Internet Control Selection was highly recommended as a basis on which to build self-regulation.<br>PICS standards are already being included in popular Internet browser software to enable adults to select appropriate sites for children.<br>Submissions to the inquiry stressed that service providers could not be responsible for all the material channelled through them. Much of the content distributed on the Net originates outside Australia, more than 60 per cent of it from the US.<br></font></p>
