            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE MUG punters who watch a bit of sport on TV are being treated like, well, mug punters.<br>It was not a classic weekend of sport. Channel 7 had its Telethon and a 40th birthday bash to attend to for starters.<br>However, the Seven festival of nostalgia on Friday night went on so long that the second international rules match between Australia and Ireland - one of the most watchable sporting contests of the year - was not available until midnight.<br>Instead of seeing Nathan Buckley tie the score after the siren in front of 45,000 at Football Park, we were recalling that the dad in Leave it to Beaver was named Ward.<br>And on Sunday, Nine, which was motoring beautifully with its local coverage of WA trying to grab first innings Sheffield Shield points from Victoria, had to cut to the booming Darrel Eastlake and the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix.<br>The tongue-tied blundering of Murray Walker could not compensate cricket fans who had been ripped away from the shield match with WA two runs short of the points and ninth wicket, Brad Williams, just run out.<br>Seven could not have guessed that international rules would capture the public's imagination so vividly on the exact weekend that it turned 40.<br>And Nine could not alter the unpredictability of cricket that made WA's run-chase so dramatic at the same time its cameras were primed to capture the historic race in Malaysia.<br>Maybe digital television promises we armchair critics relief from these troubles. After all, with proper management, digital signals will allow many more channels for a start.<br>Theoretically, Channel 7's birthday could have monopolised one channel but a second Seven channel could have shown the rules match from Adelaide live.<br>Nine could have applied two channels to ensure cricket fans were not drowned out by buzzing Ferraris; or that formula one addicts were not bored by batsmen constantly leaving the ball outside the off stump.<br>And someone might have put Perth Glory fans out of their never-ending misery.<br>Sounds good, doesn't it? Not only does digital TV promise dedicated sport for those who want it, it would also keep sport off the schedules for those who hate it.<br>But it is not going to happen, judging by the latest comments of Communications Minister Richard Alston, who will announce the exact nature of the digital TV format in six weeks.<br>Senator Alston favours high-definition TV which takes the power of the added broadcast spectrum to provide cinema-quality video and CD-quality sound. However, these enhancements leave no room for extra channels and the Internet-like add-ons that deliver news and statistics.<br>We mug punters will get more of the same.<br>It will look good and sound pretty, but we may have to put off the children's education because at the moment a high-definition TV set could cost as much as a decent used car.<br>But that's progress for you.<br></font></p>
