            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NO DOUBT about it, Premier Richard Court is a man of great vision. A jolly good belltower is just what this State needs.<br>Future generations of Sandgropers will be able to say: ?Richard Court . . . the face is not familiar, but the name rings a bell.?<br>When the belltower - the needle-sharp centrepoint of the $80 million Barrack Square development - is complete, thousands of thankful voters will traipse to the foreshore of the Swan to be enchanted by the tintinnabulation of the resurrected bells of St Martins.<br>There will be:Former bank staff from country towns looking for something to do.Victims of crime in suburbs where not enough police can be deployed.The hobbling or wheelchair-bound, would-be patients waiting in a long queue to get into an under-funded hospital.Stressed teachers trying to find a personal touch in mega-schools with more than 2000 pupils.The pupils of those teachers who have missed privatised buses while trying to go the extra kilometres to their new schools.The homeless from the city and Northbridge who now will also have more space on the extended foreshore or the pedestrian underpasses to the carparks.<br>Well done Mr Court, they'll chorus when the first dings dong . . . if they can hear themselves above the racket of which 18 big bells are no doubt capable.<br>There simply aren't enough monuments to government in this town. The belltower will take care of that.<br>But why stop at one belltower, Mr Court? Did you know that in this part of the world, Australasia, there are only 50 or so recognised belltowers, according to a list compiled by the Australian and New Zealand Association of Bell Ringers?<br>These adherents of campanology point out several in this State, including those at St George's Cathedral; Christ Church, Claremont; St Hilda's Anglican Girls School, Mosman Park; and others at York, Mandurah and Rockingham.<br>We lag way behind Italy, for example, which has between 400 and 500. Britain, with more than 5000, thrashes us.<br>We could do with bells at the top of Central Park and the BankWest building, our two tallest towers. Imagine the gleeful cacophony that would come from these places to gladden the hearts of lunchtime shoppers and commuters.<br>Why not a big welcoming bell atop the highest cargo crane at Fremantle? What a gong-ho welcome to our port that would be.<br>Belltowers should also be commissioned immediately for every country town which still has more than 1000 people. There would be an influx of bellringers - a noble art recognised as a skill by the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme for young people - to the bush.<br>Thus, everywhere a tourist was beckoned by Elle Macpherson, they would hear the sound of clangers, clappers and knockers.<br>Mr Court and his bells bring to mind a famous line of Spike Milligan's.<br>Q: What comes from cows and sounds like a bell? A: Duuuuung.<br>BUT seriously, some strange things happen in our world. Take, for example, these tid-bits gleaned from newspapers and journals around the globe:<br>From a church parish magazine: ?Would the congregation please note that the bowl at the back of the church, labelled "For The Sick' is for monetary donations only.?<br>From the Guardian in London about a sign in a police canteen: ?Will the person who took a slice of cake from the Commissioner's office return it immediately. It is needed as evidence in a poisoning case.?<br>From the Times: ?A young girl, who was blown out to sea on a set of inflatable teeth, was rescued by a man on an inflatable lobster. A coast-guard spokesman commented, "This sort of thing is all too common these days'.?<br></font></p>
