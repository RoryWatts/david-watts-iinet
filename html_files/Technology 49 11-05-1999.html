            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Internet is going through a mid-life crisis. This sounds preposterous given that the medium has been a big and popular one for only three years at best.<br>But a mid-life crisis is what it looks like.<br>The profile of users has changed from 1995 when it was dominated by young (19 to 30-year-old) students and professionals. The most comprehensive survey of Net users, by Georgia Tech in the US, shows that late last year women and older adults (35 to 40-year-olds) were starting to access the Net in the biggest numbers.<br>With this shift in demographics to an older age group with much more female participation, has come doubts and fears, as well as wonder.<br>This is illustrated by the results of a survey in the US, released two weeks ago.<br>The Annenberg Public Policy Centre phoned a small sample of 1100 Net users and found that 78 per cent of parents are ?strongly? or ?somewhat? concerned that their children might give away personal information on the Net.<br>An equal percentage fear children might view sexually explicit material. Nearly two-thirds of parents believe the Net can cause their children to become isolated, while only 35 per cent say the Net can have a community-building influence.<br>Half claim using the Net might interfere with parents' ability to teach values and beliefs.<br>At the same time, many also feel the Net is an essential tool with positive potential. Nearly 60 per cent of parents said children without access were at a disadvantage; 75 per cent said the Net was a place for children to discover fascinating, useful things; and 72 per cent believe the Net helps their children with schoolwork.<br>?Parents are juggling the dream and the nightmare of the Internet at the same time,? said Joseph Turow, author of the report.<br>Such parental concerns are also allegedly behind Richard Alston's drive to regulate content here, although enough critics have already pointed out possible political motives and the sheer inefficiency and unworkability of the regime to raise eyebrows.<br>Before Senator Alston introduced his censorship legislation, the very wired Natasha Stott Despoja, of the Australian Democrats, best summed up this love-hate, should we-shouldn't we, feeling about the Net.<br>?The Democrats understand that there is community concern about some of the content available on Internet sites, but we are also keenly aware of the difficulties inherent in any form of online content regulation. Not least of these is the significant impact on the choices and freedoms of Australian Internet users,? she says in a release at her Web site.<br>?I remain hopeful that parents, teachers and others responsible for children will come to understand that their responsibilities include the protection of children from harm and preparation for the world.<br>?Just as children are taught about how to deal with poisons, prank calls, kitchen knives and street crime, they also need to be taught about content choices and the Internet.?<br>The mid-life crisis is at least making people think about responsible approaches to the Net. And it also showing that the medium - without government intrusion - can be used to foster discussion and seek alternatives.<br>And you cannot do that with TV - the passive babysitter that Senator Alston and others like to equate with the Net when seeking reasons to regulate it.<br></font></p>
