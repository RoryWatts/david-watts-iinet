            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS is an example of how Australia's Net censorship might work after January 1, 2000:<br>1: The creator of a Web site - defined by the legislation as a content host - publishes a page containing pictures of naked supermodels. He calls the page www.nudegirl.com.au.<br>2: A Net user is offended by the photos on the page and complains in writing to the Australian Broadcasting Authority.<br>3: The ABA first has to decide whether the complaint is frivolous, in which case it will go no further. In this case it decides www.nudegirl.com.au needs investigation.<br>4: The nudegirl creator is issued with a formal notice from the ABA to cease publication of the site. If he does not comply he can be fined on a daily basis.<br>5: The ABA passes the page to the National Classification Board which will determine what classification to give it. (The board is currently responsible for rating other media).<br>6: The classification board gives www.nudegirl.com.au an R-rating and tells the creator the site can be uploaded to an ISP which has age-verification software in a bid to stop under-18s accessing it.<br>7: www.nudegirl.com.au is posted on the Web again, but the ISP has not been able to provide the age-checking software.<br>8: The ABA issues a formal notice to the ISP telling it to take www.nudegirl.com.au off the Web or face daily fines until it does.<br>The legislation will not apply to Web content only. Wording of the Bill suggests that newsgroups and chat sites can also be the subject of complaints.<br>Senator Alston says the legislation will not cover private communications such as intraNets, so it is unlikely e-mail will fall under the ABA's jurisdiction.<br>Critics say that in the above example, the creator of www.nudegirl.com.au could simply buy or find a free site for his content and change its name to something like www.girl.com.au.<br>The content that had run through the bureaucratic chain would then be freely available, at any time, until another written complaint was made about it.<br></font></p>
