            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SANTA CLAUS lives in cyberspace, along with Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, the elves and hordes of helpers.<br>This indisputable fact can be examined by anyone travelling the World Wide Web at this crowded, festive time of the year.<br>A search for Santa Claus using the excellent resources of Yahoo reveals 22 pages mentioning him. Beware just typing Santa in the search. You will get more than 600 results, most having to do with American place names such as Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara.<br>But the real Santa is out there and doing a roaring trade in Christmas e-mail.<br>Many Santa sites offer browsers the opportunity to e-mail Santa with a reply assured.<br>These pages, in most cases put up by individuals who say they believe in Christmas magic, often give textual histories of the Santa Claus story.<br>To briefly bring Internauts up to date: The original Santa Claus, St Nicholas, was born in the ancient south-eastern Turkish town of Lycia early in the fourth century.<br>His generosity was legend, and he was particularly fond of children. This is known through Roman accounts of his patronage of youth, which eventually led to his becoming the patron saint of children.<br>From there, eventually, came our fat, red-suited, white-bearded gift giver.<br>Some Santa sites have been set up to raise money for charities, particularly for youth programs - Santa Claus Anonymous in the US is a prime example.<br>Norwegians and Danes, with their liking for Kris Kringle and extremely snowy Christmases, also proliferate on the Web.<br>Commercialism has not been overlooked in the cyberworld. Much as shopping centres use Santa to flog anything from aftershave to cars, home pages follow the same routine.<br>A Yahoo search for Christmas found 125 matches and many of them were cyber catalogues of gifts.<br>But the real Christmas story as told by St Matthew and St Luke in the Gospels also got a decent guernsey, along with excerpts of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.<br>(St Matthew, writing a regal story of Jesus the king for a Jewish audience, told of the wise men and their gifts. St Luke, in a proletarian version for a gentile audience, reported on the shepherds. These essentials of any nativity play were never on stage together in their original texts.)<br>Not anywhere near as worthy, but typically nerdy are texts of parodies of The Night Before Christmas, featuring characters from Star Trek.<br>It would not be the Web without them.<br>The following pages give an idea of what goes on on the Web at this time of year: Christmas Around the World, the Christmas Book (a personal list manager and gift tracker), Cut Bloom Orchids for Christmas and All About Christmas (a catalogue of hand-made ornaments).<br>Also, there was the Cape Fear Christmas Catalogue, which honestly made the mind boggle.<br>Decorations for computers were among the better seasonal offerings.<br>At Welcome to the North Pole, it is possible to download a gift of a Christmas card, which can be printed that way, or with the right graphics software - Paint Shop Pro, for example - can be batch converted to a bmp file to be used as wallpaper.<br>Audio of Jingle Bells and Handel's Messiah are also available.<br>A couple of screensavers with Santa driving the reindeer are also out there on the Web and easy to download for the patient user.<br></font></p>
