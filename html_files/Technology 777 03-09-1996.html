            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE definition of what is cool on the Web changes constantly as more people join in and the profile of the Net population alters.<br>Where Pamela Anderson pages or Star Trek homages drew most hits and adulation only two years ago, the quest for artistic and literary quality now appears to have more merit.<br>Netizens are getting older, there are a growing number of women, and businesses now see the Net as a useful tool.<br>Still there are certain criteria that set one site apart from another. The staff at InfiNet have listed five hints for creating cool sites.<br>And as curators of Cool Site of the Day and Cool Site of the Year they should know.<br>First they advise surfers to create something useful.<br>?On a bad Internet day downloading a Web page is like watching the grass grow - only with advertisements,? InfiNet says.<br>?We don't expect your page to cure psoriasis, but you'll have a better chance at being Cool Site of the Day if you provide goodies for your visitors.?<br>InfiNet suggests images of leading celebrities, a search engine or even carefully thought-out personal opinions on a topical subject.<br>But if surfers cannot be useful they can be entertaining, InfiNet says.<br>The staff say they value this trait ?because it explains why we bought Kiss albums when we were teenagers?.<br>Size and download times are also important. Every kilobyte on a page takes roughly a second to download meaning it can take up to two minutes to see a 100kb page.<br>InfiNet tells surfers with an addiction to big files to try to use their time more productively ... ?like going out in the real world and dating?.<br>Personal pictures are frowned on: ?Unless 100 people have told you that you're beautiful or remarkable, don't put your photo on a Web page.?<br>The exceptions are those surfers who have third eyes, extra limbs or odd proportions.<br>The final piece of InfiNet advice on cool sites is probably the most invaluable ... don't forget to submit the URL.<br>The staff say they have had dozens of descriptions of what sound truly cool pages, only to find there is no Web address ... which is uncool.<br></font></p>
