            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">OPPOSITION to the Federal Government's plans to censor the Net has accelerated since Communications Minister Richard Alston introduced the legislation last Wednesday.<br>?An online petition protesting against the legislation was attracting more than 300 signatures a day. On Saturday it had more than 6000 names.<br>?A Sydney lawyer with extensive Net experience published a Web page at the weekend damning the legislation on economic and legal grounds.<br>?Free speech campaigners Electronic Frontiers Australia set out action plans for protests in special Web pages.<br>?Correspondents to censorshiprelated newsgroups continued to pillory the legislation and its motives, and argued how to disrupt its planned January 1, 2000, introduction.<br>?The US-based Wired News ran a report headlined ?No smut please, we're Australian? which claimed that censorship was being introduced to win the vote of Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine.<br>Senator Alston says censorship is aimed at protecting children and is a bid ?to stop paedophiles, drug pushers, bomb makers and racists from using the Internet to spread their poison?.<br>Amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act now before Parliament will give the Australian Broadcasting Authority the power to investigate consumer complaints about offensive Net content.<br>People hosting content deemed in need of investigation would be issued notices to stop publication while the classification board, which rates films, books and video games, decided whether the content required a R rating or be refused classification.<br>R-rated material would be allowed but only if Internet service providers can guarantee a mechanism that checks for proof of age and stops under-18s accessing it. Content refused classification (X-rated) would have to be blocked.<br>Any ISP found to be hosting X-rated material, or R-rated material not protected by an adult verification system, would have to remove it within 24 hours of being notified. Fines of $25,000 a day for non-compliance have been mooted.<br>Critics of censorship are still reading the fine detail of the Bill which is available on the Web in both Microsoft Word and HTML format. But since Senator Alston announced his censorship intentions last month, the thrust of criticism has been that the proposals are unworkable and will impede growth of the medium.<br>The CSIRO released a report this month declaring that Senator Alston's chosen methods of blocking access ?will be largely ineffective?. The body recommended the use of private filtering software instead, with the onus on users to choose what they see.<br>The EFA's online petition, expected to be presented to the Senate within months, calls the Net a ?complex, global environment where traditional concepts of regulation are not easily applied or enforced?. It says the full potential for development of the Net depends on governments recognising rights to freedom of speech taken for granted by other societies.<br>?Emerging information industries should not be burdened with unnecessary and poorly conceived regulation,? the petition says.<br>The EFA has labelled Senator Alston's legislation as draconian and paternalistic, and called the senator naive and stupid. Last week it accused the Government of treating Australian adults like children in what it sees as an attempt to appease Senator Harradine.<br>?This Bill is proclaimed as protecting children from paedophiles, drug pushers and the like, but it will do nothing of the sort,? EFA executive director Darce Cassidy said. ?It is actually aimed squarely at preventing adult access to non-violent erotica, which is legally available in Australia in other media.<br>?Adults don't need to be told what they can read by the Government. Nor do they want lies from the Government about the real effect of this Bill.? He said the Bill was a crude attempt to browbeat the Labor Opposition and rush legislation through Parliament.<br>Sydney lawyer Brendan Scott, the editor of Computers and Law, has published a Web page called the Dawn Of A New Dark Age? He calls the censorship plans a shameless initiative based on the balance of power in the Senate.<br>?These proposals fly in the face of technical advice received by the Government and are being rushed through with very little time for community comment,? he said. ?The proposals are more reminiscent of censorship in, say, a totalitarian regime.?<br>Mr Scott damns the legislation as failing any test of a sensible approach to Net regulation. ?It inhibits the domestic retail market for Internet services by increasing the data purchase costs of the ISPs least able to afford it,? he said.<br>?It puts in place a totally unworkable administrative process to implement regulation that Internet users do not want, and it casts its net so broadly as would serve quite adequately as the groundwork for a totalitarian state.<br>?It is the sort of legislation that Voltaire would have railed against at the dawn of the Age of Reason.?<br>HELP DESK<br>Censorship Bill and speech:<br>www.dcita.gov.au/<br>EFA links to censorship updates:<br>www.southcom.com.au/censor/<br>Online petition:<br>www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/petition.html<br>CSIRO report:<br>www.csiro.au/news/mediarel/<br>mr1999/mr9975.html<br>New Dark Age?:<br>www.gtlaw.com.au/pubs/<br>newdarkage.html<br></font></p>
