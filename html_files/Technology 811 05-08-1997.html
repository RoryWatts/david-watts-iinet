            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Netscape's browser is, in many ways, the yardstick of the Web. It's come a long way in four years.<br>Only four years ago, Paul Keating won the unwinnable election and Shane Warne bowled the ball of the century to Mike Gatting.<br>It wasn't long ago. Most of those memories are still fresh in many people's minds.<br>But as far as the Internet is concerned, 1993 was almost prehistoric.<br>The idea of reading the complete works of Shakespeare from a computer across the world, or of listening to CD-quality music from a new artist in Europe was beyond the ken of most.<br>The Net was a viable concern mostly for academics, using Unix programs to read text or play basic games.<br>The rush to plug a home computer and modem into the World Wide Web was not possible until software developers at the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications in Chicago had made a program called Mosaic which enabled Net documents to show images and hints of design.<br>Within a year of Warne's terrific leg-spinner, the Web started to show its possibilities. There were about 500 Web sites. By the start of 1995, there were nearly 10,000.<br>The catalyst came in October 1994 with the birth of Netscape Navigator. Developed by many who had made Mosaic possible, Navigator was the first commercial venture into Web browsing.<br>It made the Web into an attractive new medium. Netscape guru Marc Andreesen's business philosophy of allowing Navigator to be freely available for download on the Net also changed the way many software makers distributed their products.<br>Navigator was revolutionary all right but it is fascinating to look now at what its first big release - version 1.1 - made possible, and compare it with what the latest browser - packaged with the Communicator suite - can do for the average Netizen.<br>Bear in mind that between one and two per cent of Net users still have Netscape 1.1 browsers, according to surveys by Web analysis companies WebTrends and Interse.<br>Here are some of the things they miss out on regularly ? although whether they are all totally necessary enhancements is debatable.<br>E-mail:<br>Version 1.1 users could send e-mail - that's it.<br>Three years on, a Communicator user can set up multiple mailboxes and filter incoming mail to lob into the appropriate one.<br>Graphic attachments such as drawings or pictures can be displayed in the mail window.<br>Outgoing mail can be formatted as a HTML document.<br>Mailboxes from programs such as Eudora can be imported into Messenger - Communicator's e-mailer - and treated like Netscape mail.<br>News<br>Version 1.1 allowed newsgroups to be read from a URL in a page or from typed addresses in the URL location box, for example: news:aus.tv.<br>There was no filtering or subscribing.<br>Communicator's Collabra interface treats newsgroups as virtually another mailbox.<br>Users can subscribe and unsubscribe and configure groups to show only the most recent postings. Again, graphic attachments and files are shown directly in the news window with no need for decoding by an outside program.<br>Frames<br>Old Netscape will not read frames. If the Web page author has written HTML properly, a non-frames version of the page will appear, or a page will tell the 1.1 user to go to another link.<br>Frames are bread and butter to the newer Navigators but they can be frustrating to navigate if badly designed and hard to read.<br>Java<br>Version 1.1 can't see it and doesn't know what it is. In quite a few cases, this is a blessing (see screenshot below).<br>In Communicator, Java programs written into the HTML document play merrily on the user's screen, or nag mercilessly on the bottom scroll bar. Communicator reads Java more smoothly than its predecessors.<br>Fonts:<br>Version 1.1 knows only one font, Times Roman. It's a lovely typeface but repeated doses become a little boring.<br>Communicator, like Navigator 3, lets users see different fonts formatted by the author - if they have them on their machine. A page creator may have something fancy and powerful such as Impact, but if the person viewing the page on another computer doesn't have it, they'll get ? Times Roman.<br>Shockwave<br>This Macromedia application has become used widely. It shows clever animations and brings good sound when used properly. You may have guessed it, but it's not in 1.1's armoury.<br>Bookmarks<br>In version 1.1 you clicked on bookmarks and then on add bookmark. When you went to organise them into some sort of easily followed system, you were confronted with a myriad of baffling instructions in a deadly dull grey panel.<br>Now you can drag the icon next to the URL location box on to the bookmarks tag in the menu. Bookmarks open to reveal whatever folders you may have created. You then drop the URL icon into the one of your choice. Or, you can drop the icon on to the new personal toolbar so the link is right there for clicking any time; no need to even open the bookmark folder.<br>HTML<br>Until Navigator Gold appeared, you created Web pages in another program. Real nerds did it in Notepad, SimpleText or DOS Edlin.<br>Communicator carries an easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor called Composer which is an ideal tool for learning HTML. It also enables authors to upload pages to their server.<br>The new generation of browser offers much more, such as teleconferencing, interactive chat, ActiveX and FutureSplash. The question is: what will the next four years bring?<br>More importantly, will Shane Warne ever bowl a ball as good as that again?<br>HELP DESK<br>Netscape: home.netscape.com or www.netscape.com.au<br>Source of historical information - TechWeb Technology Encyclopedia:<br>www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/<br>Browser survey: www.webtrends.com/PRODUCTS/<br>WEBTREND/REPORTS/industry/<br>browser/dec96/report.htm<br>GVU surveys: www.gvu.gatech.edu/user_surveys/<br></font></p>
