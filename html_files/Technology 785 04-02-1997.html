            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE may have found the way to render most other Internet applications useless.<br>Its beta release of Navigator 4.0 - called Communicator because it is much more than a Web browser - has the serious potential to take away users' needs for email programs, newsreaders, HTML editors and possibly chat software.<br>All that, plus the fact that the Navigator Web browser is still the best around.<br>Communicator beta made its download debut in December, but WestWeb wanted a few weeks to get an overall feel rather than make snap judgments.<br>But Communicator - a ?minimum? 6Mb version downloaded from Beyond the Black Stump Software - has behaved pretty well in the past three weeks, only occasionally causing lock-ups or protection faults. But overall the bugs have not detracted from a fair appraisal.<br>The biggest question with Communicator is why is it necessary? Navigator 3.0 is actually very good. Its HTML support, news and mail and plugin features are still ahead of Microsoft Internet Explorer's.<br>And Navigator 3.0 was released only last September. This never-ending rush to update software has the capacity to alienate Net users just getting the hang of a previous release.<br>The bogey is Microsoft's stated determination to rule cyberspace. The software giant is working on MSIE 4.0, integrating it totally on the Windows desktop. But this piece of software is still at least a month or two away.<br>Netscape needed to get runs on the board and Communicator is the result.<br>MSIE 3.0 has also made some serious inroads into Netscape's domination of the browser market. One US survey had the two only a few points away from each other. Those figures were released before MSIE 3.0 became an official package for the Mac and just after the Win3.1 version arrived.<br>And so we have Communicator, a handsome package which some reviewers say borrows heavily from MSIE's streamlined interface.<br>That surface similarity is there, adding attractive toolbar icons and a handy floating bar to control the various applications.<br>Communicator users not only have a browser at their fingertips, but also their email inbox, a discussions centre listing all mailboxes and subscribed newsgroups, and a WYSIWYG HTML editor.<br>When Communicator is installed all programs appear separately with the familiar Navigator icon. This is overkill, perhaps trying to emphasise the breadth of the program.<br>A user needs only one Netscape icon. The floating toolbar takes care of application switching.<br>Netscape has given each application a snappy title - email is Messenger, HTML is Composer and News is Collabra. It is a marketing ploy to inject more new feeling into the new look.<br>Overall the basic workings of all Netscape functions seem little changed. The user interface has been improved in every aspect, however, showing page names on the back and forward browser buttons, giving clearer mail notification and making it easier to read individual mail and news items.<br>The impression the new-look integration gives, with new windows spawned on each click, is that Netscape is in charge of your Net session and there is no need to dive into Eudora, HotDog or Agent.<br>NOT on our beta was Conference, a groupware application that lets you talk and collaborate on documents with others around the world in ?real-time?.<br>Dialling somebody is simply a matter of typing their email address. There's also a collaborative browsing feature that lets you drag the person you're chatting to behind you as you surf.<br>A word of warning: Communicator is a 10Mb download in its ?maximum? version, and on installation care is needed so that earlier Netscape versions are not affected by folder and file changes.<br>Communicator also lacks an uninstall facility, a serious shortcoming for a beta release.<br>URLs for download: Check your access provider to see if they have Communicator, or try Beyond the Black Stump's Software section:<br>werple.net.au/~lions/software.htm<br></font></p>
