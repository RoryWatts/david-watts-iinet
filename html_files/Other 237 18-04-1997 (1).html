            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE taxi driver was a New Zealander - but not a bad bloke for that. Like many of his countrymen he had been involved in ugly bar-room brawls when younger, had ridden motorbikes and travelled far and wide with only a backpack for company.<br>He had worked at odd jobs around the world including planting roses and trees in stately English gardens.<br>Like any New Zealander he gloated about his little country's Olympic record (?remember 1976 Aussie, hey?), and could name all the countless times the All Blacks had thrashed the Wallabies. He would not talk cricket, though.<br>So, like any good Australian does to his close neighbour, I told him the joke about the three great Kiwi lies.<br>It has several variations, but the one I know is: the three great Kiwi lies are - my sister is a Maori princess; I had a trial for the All Blacks; and unfortunately the third is unprintable in a family newspaper, but refers to the Land of the Long White Cloud's close affinity with sheep.<br>New Zealand has sheep like Australia has sand. There are lots of them - 60 million, said my driver. We have more than 150 million here but they are lost in the vastness.<br>By contrast, in New Zealand you can barely see the breathtaking scenery for the sheep. Every green hill, and there are many, is dotted with fluffy white bundles.<br>Anyway, my Kiwi driver had not heard the great lies joke. He didn't laugh that much either. Instead he turned to me and proclaimed that back home no one ever made sheep jokes.<br>It was only when he came to Australia that people started telling them to him. And then only after they had heard him pronounce fush and chups.<br>We then talked about England, how green and pleasant much of the countryside is. But the talk quickly turned to sheep again.<br>H OW fat and lazy, how happy they were, remarked the driver with a wistful look ... all the better for yummy chops and legs of lamb with rosemary and thyme. So this love of sheep was on the same level as mine, we concluded with a relieved laugh.<br>Lately on the Internet many have been taking this love of sheep a little too far.<br>There now exists a software program called Microsoft Sheep. When invoked this causes little cartoon pictures of sheep to wander across the user's screen.<br>They do not appear to do much except crane their woolly heads to look at whatever you are working on.<br>If you perform the correct clicking sequence with your mouse (the tool that helps you select things on-screen - not a marsupial) then you can make the sheep disappear in a sort of puff of smoke.<br>It obviously amuses those with time on their hands or terminal writer's block.<br>I found these comments about Microsoft Sheep on an electronic bulletin board or newsgroup: ?Whilst I was running a sheep, this alien keeps popping up. The first time, a spaceship flew along and beamed an alien down. The second time, the ship captured the sheep.<br>?Bizarre,? (name and address withheld).<br>?Have you had one catch fire, streak across the screen and douse itself in a bathtub yet? Even more bizarre.? This carried the annotation ?I still love mutton curry? with the writer's name.<br>Will this fascination with fiery sheep prone to alien capture ever end, I wonder.<br>MOUTHS of babes department: Three different GYMs (gorgeous young mums) told me their children gave the following answers in preschool to the old reliable: ?What are you going to be when you grow up??<br>First child (a boy): A dinosaur. Second child (a blond, fair-skinned boy): An Aboriginal. Third child (a girl): A woman.<br>Only one was right. It was the female ... they're always right, so they tell me.<br></font></p>
