            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE bomb which shattered the IRA cease-fire in London on Friday forced one of the world's greatest newspapers on to the Net in a big way.<br>The Guardian, whose main offices are in the City of London but whose printing presses are in Docklands, lost one of its three state-of-the-art presses in the blast.<br>It was able to print more than half its Saturday edition in Manchester where it also maintains presses, but went on the World Wide Web at the weekend with a blanket coverage of the bomb and its effects.<br>Unlike the Times and the Daily Telegraph, two of its main Fleet Street rivals, the Guardian has not been publishing news of the day on the Net.<br>Instead it stuck to a quirky, esoteric formula - said to be typically Guardian - by publishing only scientific and computer news from the paper and Net specials, designed for cyberspace only.<br>The IRA changed all that about 7pm Friday with its massive blast that appears to have wrecked months of a delicate peace process.<br>The Guardian carried a main page on the Net announcing loudly that one of its presses had been hit and pointing out that readers could get all the coverage of the blast on the World Wide Web if they had missed the paper version because of press damage.<br>The paper's coverage was intense with lead story, five analysis pieces, four reaction articles, eyewitness accounts and an editorial all available on the Net.<br>The real front page of the paper and pictures used with the news were included.<br>The Guardian has a strong reputation for coverage of big stories. When Margaret Thatcher resigned all but two foreign news pages had articles linked in one way or another to the ?Iron Lady?.<br>In a gesture both very British and very Guardianesque, the paper did not mention the damage to its own presses in the news coverage.<br>http://go2.guardian.co.uk<br></font></p>
