            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE exercise of locking four half-naked people in a room in London with nothing but credit cards and a computer raises an interesting question: could someone in Perth do the same thing and live off the Internet alone for four days?<br>I have not - and will not - be trying the experiment, but would have to say it seems possible, in fact it probably would be relatively easy.<br>You have to bear in mind that the London adventure has been a giant publicity stunt for Microsoft. Attempts to chat with the London volunteers and watch them on Webcam with a Netscape browser have led to a message saying the user must install Microsoft Internet Explorer, for example.<br>Putting that aside, it is not a bad publicity stunt and will possibly prompt companies to look at how e-commerce could be improved.<br>The main problem for the London group appears to have been in ordering clothing online and having it delivered quickly enough so that the volunteers can discard their bathrobes.<br>A fairly rapid browse of Perth Web services shows that clothing might be the only black spot here too.<br>Anyone trying to live off the Net in Perth could be assured of food, entertainment, information, conversation and intellectual stimulation. They would just look a bit silly.<br>But let us look at some areas where it would be possible to live by the Net alone:<br>Food - You could lock yourself away and still eat healthily without resorting to takeaways. Alternatively, you could happily gorge on takeaways alone.<br>The grocery chain, Dewsons, offers online ordering of all types of grocery goodies. Payment by credit card is accepted and users pay a surcharge for Web-ordered deliveries.<br>Takeaway fanciers could order online from PizzaNow or ChowNow. Both services allow registered users to browse the menus of the nearest pizza restaurant or Asian takeaway and submit choices by e-mail. Payment is by cash or credit card on delivery.<br>Books - There is no need to resort to overseas giants Amazon or Barnes and Noble and endure a couple of weeks' wait. The Well Bookshop in Subiaco has offered online shopping for some time now. Dymocks and the ABC Shop also would allow faster Australian purchases but delivery could be later than the 100-hour experiment might tolerate.<br>Entertainment - For music, easy. Just go to the 2200 radio stations listed by the BRS Directory and click open the one likely to offer your choice of tunes. You could order CDs from 78 Records in Hay Street by using the store's simple Web search system.<br>Or you could look at Telstra's SureLink shopping guide to find other music outlets.<br>Watching movies would be impossible because of bandwidth problems, but you could spend hours browsing the Internet Movie Database and going from there to film home pages where short video clips are often available.<br>Alternatively, you could compile your top 100 movies guide and compare your ratings with those of other IMDb surfers.<br>Information - The Net's strong suite is the bulk of newspapers and magazines online. You could spend 100 hours leafing through Newsweek or the Economist without noticing the time.<br>If you wanted more action, you could play video clips at the BBC or Fox News sites.<br>Conversation - Someone locked away on the Net for 100 hours will start to realise the importance of e-mail in catching up with real people, especially those you know.<br>Chat lines offer limited fun and there are a lot of buffoons out to shock and ruin your day. The ICQ program would ensure a Net castaway talked only to those they wanted to.<br>Newsgroups would allow participation in arguments about any one of 20,000 subjects.<br>Intellectual stimulation - The newsgroups might prove too vigorous, so online forums on weighty subjects (often found at the BBC and CNN sites) would be a good antidote.<br>Clothing - A bright idea would be to e-mail a friend and ask them to collect some clothes from your place. If that is outside the bounds of the experiment, then look hard for online clothing at portal sites such as the Best of Perth and Perth Internet.<br>Survival by Net and credit card alone looks entirely feasible. In fact, one worry might be exceeding the credit limit. In which case, you could go to your online bank and transfer more money or cancel scheduled bill payments.<br>HELP DESK<br>London survival experiment:<br>msn.co.uk/page/140-989.asp<br>Dewsons: www.dewsons.com.au<br>ChowNow: www.chownow.com.au<br>PizzaNow: www.pizzanow.com.au<br>BRS Radio Directory: www.radio-directory.fm<br>78 Records: www.78records.com.au<br>Internet Movie Database: www.imdb.com<br>Well Bookshop: www.thewell.com.au<br>Other bookshop sites: www.iinet.net.au/~watto/<br>index1.html#lit<br>Telstra SureLink: www.surelink.com.au/shopsafe-fs.htm<br>Newspapers and magazines: www.iinet.net.au/<br>~watto/index1.<br>html#newspapers<br>Project Gutenberg: promo.net/pg/<br>Internet Public Library: www.ipl.org<br>DejaNews (to search for newsgroup discussions): www.dejanews.com<br>Best of Perth: www.bestofperth.com.au<br>Perth Internet: perthinter.net<br></font></p>
