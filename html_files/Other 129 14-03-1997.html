            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT'S funny what we find funny. Toddlers laugh at the mention of bottom and poo, 10-year-olds find The Nanny side-splitting, teenagers are often too cool to let on, but pictures of their parents in flares and love beads rate a titter.<br>Bright young things in their early 20s crack up if there's enough swearing, GYMs (gorgeous young mums) find SODs (silly old dads) laughable when they protest at having to work too hard.<br>Seniors can afford to laugh the most. They've seen it all before and are amused that young adults can be so serious about life.<br>Overall many of us find jokes - the sillier the better - a good tonic. Last week, a neighbour whose nickname is Mouse told me a very silly one-liner.<br>I had to go out and repeat it to the nearest nun.<br>And I found one. Now it's a big ask, as the footy commentators say, to tell a nun a joke. This is especially so if you come from a background where nuns were such distant authority figures that one would never dare utter more than a polite ?g'day sister? to them.<br>Mine was a country town typical for its time. It was a Carlton v Collingwood or Celtic v Rangers type of place. The Catholic church occupied the best spot of land in the main street. The Protestant churches, though less favourably located, outnumbered and flanked it like troops marshalling for a pincer move.<br>The Catholic businessmen occupied one end of town, the Protestants the other. The biggest local derby was Collegians (former Christian Brothers College boys) v Suburbs (townies) at rugby league.<br>The Catholic boys - all those Hagans and Kellys and O'Hallorans and Mahoneys - would go to Mass then beat the living daylights out of the less God-fearing Suburbs boys.<br>In fact the only Suburbs player who shone was the half-back who routinely attended the Anglican sung eucharist before the game. Surely a lesson there.<br>Thus it was hard to ever think of telling a nun a joke.<br>But many years have passed, the world has changed and nuns are not formidable but friendly and chatty now.<br>So I said to her: ?Sister, what do you call a sleepwalking nun??<br>She didn't know but was interested to hear.<br>?A Roamin' Catholic,? I said.<br>And instead of lightning striking, or the ground swallowing me into the bottomless pit, she laughed and vowed to race straight back to the convent to tell the other sisters.<br>It was a horrible little joke, but told at the right time it seemed hilarious. That grand old Dane Victor Borge, who was in Perth recently, is one of the best at delivering similar types of silly lines and splitting even serious sides.<br>The other day I watched a video of a Borge performance with many of his famous silly jokes.<br>For example: ?My father didn't talk to my mother for a whole week ... he didn't want to interrupt her.<br>?My father asked me how old I was. I told him eight. "When I was your age, I was 12'.<br>?One cold winter's day my father arrived home to find me in front of a roaring fire. He wasn't happy. We didn't have a fireplace.?<br>You get the picture, silly, but funny. Real life also throws up many true stories just as silly; some of them downright stupid.<br>?A bus carrying five passengers was hit by a car in St Louis, but by the time police arrived on the scene, 14 pedestrians had boarded the bus and had begun to complain of whiplash injuries and back pain.<br>?Swedish business consultant Ulf af Trolle laboured 13 years on a book about economic solutions. He took the 250-page manuscript to be copied, only to have it reduced to 50,000 strips of paper in seconds when a worker confused the copier with the shredder.<br>?When two service station attendants in Ionia, Michigan, refused to hand over the cash to an intoxicated robber, the man threatened to call the police. They continued to refuse, so the would-be robber called the gendarmes .. and they took him away.<br>David Watts can be contacted via e-mail: watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
