            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THEY will no doubt remember the incident differently, but the two ravishing GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums) almost caused the extermination of their species from this column.<br>It was at a little Christmas drinks thingie about a week ago when these two gorgeous visions in little black dresses started playfully punching me in the arm until the bruises showed. ?Why aren't you writing about us any more, David? Have you gone off us GYMs? What have we done to deserve this?? they nattered on, pausing only to quaff some more chardonnay.<br>I assured them I had not forgotten them, that I still loved GYMs; it was just that there were other things in life to report on and waffling about their exploits would have to earn its position rather than be taken for granted.<br>?After all, as the French say, one man's fish is another man's poisson,? I told them as they resumed beating my shoulders to a pulp. ?We know you think we've got old and ugly and aren't worth writing about,? they cackled. ?Do you think we are GOGs (Grizzling Old Grannies) now??<br>"Nothing of the sort,? I assured them, ?I could say you are NOBs every now and then though.?<br>?NOBs, what's NOBs, sounds like it's got knobs on to me,? one chortled.?Nagging Old B. . .? I started to say.<br>When I awoke under the nice, clean sheets in the hospital, the doctor assured me the wounds would be healed by Christmas but I was not to drink alcohol and had to steer clear of noisy celebrations.<br>This means I have to keep away from NOBs . . . sorry, GYMs . . . for the time being.<br>However, it does not stop me telling a few funny things about some of them and one of their great preoccupations: age.<br>Two GYMs who are around the 40 mark and amazingly good cooks do some catering around town. They were being entertained the other day by some grateful clients. These grateful clients happened to be young men in their early 20s, the type of blokes who have chests instead of guts, skin instead of wrinkles and bright eyes instead of ones that are glued to the cricket.<br>As their long lunch reached the port and cigars stage - or for these youngsters the more beer and no smoking stage - they showed their appreciation for the cooking of the GYMs by embracing the girls and giving them a few friendly pecks.<br>All quite innocent and charming, and the GYMs were chuffed at the attention of young men. It brought back memories.<br>A young waitress came over to one of the GYMS. With misty eyes, she said: ?Oh I do love these occasions. It's so wonderful to see genuine displays of affection.<br>?And so nice to see you mothers take your sons out.?<br>Another GYM friend, on hearing the above story, had her own tale of ageist woe to tell.<br>She is also around the 40 mark, but told of an incident about 10 years ago when she was still 12 years older than the average age of the bright young things queuing up with her at a nightclub door.<br>She got to the door. It was late at night and dark. ?Sorry, I'll have to check your ID to see if you're old enough to get in,? barked the doorman.<br>Gusts of emotion filled her. Oh happy day. She reached into her bag for the ID. ?Nah, it's alright lady,? came the doorman's voice, ?I've just caught sight of you in the light. Go on in. Take care.?<br>A LITTLE blonde joke to finish. A blonde was walking beside a narrow stream. She wore a worried look. To her relief, she spied another blonde on the other side of the stream.?Oh hi, how do I get to the other side?? blonde No 1 called to blonde No 2. ?You are on the other side,? came the reply.<br></font></p>
