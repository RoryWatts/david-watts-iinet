            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">STUCK with nothing much to do the other night I poked my nose in the latest copy of New Scientist magazine. This was a big mistake.<br>First, was there an Old Scientist magazine, I wondered. It could be one where Pythagoras's theorem is still big news and flat earth believers might have a forum.<br>Or it could be read by egghead types once they had reached a certain age. No longer interested in studying bodies at parties to see how their particles shape up while spilling conundrums all over the carpet, the new scientist would know he was now ready to subscribe to the Old version.<br>About 30 minutes later the big problem hit . . . a massive headache. New Scientist is not for the straight-minded, simple thinker. The articles are on a different plane.<br>This is not the type of plane that Mal Colston might hop on in his prolific flits. It is not a plane from Ansett or Qantas. It is a mental plane.<br>A mental plane takes the dear reader on a flight through probability theories, Cartesian dualism, random chaos principles and to other brain-spraining destinations.<br>But, seduced by a little feature on cavalier king charles spaniels showing behavioural traits of 20-day-old wolf cubs (fascinating stuff), I skipped to the centrespread.<br>This pondered whether man could use science to solve all problems, and if not, did it really matter.<br>To cut a long story short, it doesn't. But knowing why is the headache-maker.<br>Once upon a time a mathematician named David Hilbert postulated there were no no-go areas. Science could prove anything. Within a few years a logician called Kurt Godel brought Hilbert's dreams to earth.<br>Any logical system rich enough to model mathematics would always have insoluble problems, he said. In short, it can be proved that you can't prove everything.<br>Huh . . . the headache started and I was only on the fourth paragraph.<br>THE mental plane then went into a scatological tailspin. To prove that you can't prove everything, the New Scientist asked readers to consider the problem of working out whether a computer program would stop or go on forever.<br>What you do is set up a master predictor program called A. You then feed a test program called B into it. A stops when it determines that B will never stop. Eject program B, then, to prove the theory properly, feed program A into itself.<br>Now A will stop when it determines that A can never stop. You see, headache stuff.<br>It went on further proving that you can't prove things with an anecdote about two Cambridge University boffins who built a toy train set and tried to prove that the train might never reach the station.<br>I sincerely hope Cambridge did not fund this.<br>After all that it was comforting to receive a message from my mate Kevin in Washington with something that can be proved: things not to say to a policeman at a random breath test.<br>?No, Lucifer . . . I'm not as think you are drunk I am. I swear to dog.<br>?I know I was weaving but I was trying to hit all those little green men.<br>?On the way to the station let's get a slab.<br>?How long is this going to take? Your wife is expecting me.<br>Kevin followed these up with some bumper stickers he'd like to see:<br>?He who laughs last thinks slowest.<br>?Give me ambiguity or give me something else.<br>?All generalisations are false, including this one. (this is almost in New Scientist league).<br>?Change is inevitable, except from a vending machine.<br>???<br>AT A party for an exceedingly gorgeous GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) recently, another GYM asked this:<br>What is the difference between a wife and a girlfriend? About 20 kilos.<br></font></p>
