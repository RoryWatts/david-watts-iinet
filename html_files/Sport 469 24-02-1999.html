            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WE COULD be in for a long and painful football season.<br>It would be silly to make predictions based on just one game in the Ansett Cup.<br>But if you did, you would have to say neither West Coast nor Fremantle will make the final eight ... perhaps not even the final 12.<br>The Eagles first hit-out at Waverley last Thursday revealed, with some exceptions, a group of fit, tanned blokes afraid to get their new footy clothes dirty.<br>Even if we can disregard this February madness of a sluggish West Coast and an inept Fremantle, the prognosis of a long and painful season still applies.<br>This point was hammered home just four minutes into the Eagles-Richmond game by the golden words ?no prior opportunity?.<br>Yes. John Russo, the fourth umpire is back.<br>If the Tiger defence crowded West Coast's forward line, limiting Scott Cummings' chances, what about the Channel 7 team crowding Waverley?<br>With Russo came the full complement. Bruce McAvaney was garrulous host, Ian Robertson was main caller (mistaking Eagle after Eagle), Mick McGuane was analysis man, Peter McKenna basked in the stands with a scattering of fans, and Robert Dipierdomenico and Richard Osborne chased everything - including comedian Jerry Lewis - on the boundary.<br>And there was a Seven reporter in the stands, too.<br>For one game in a pre-season competition, it was definitely overkill. The sort of overkill that led to time-wasting exchanges like this:<br>McAvaney: ?That's holding the ball.?<br>Russo: ?It's holding the ball Bruce.?<br>McAvaney: ?Yes, as John Russo just informed us, it was holding the ball.?<br>But all is not lost. The Seven team that covered Friday night's fast and furious contest between Port Adelaide and Adelaide was sharp.<br>Seconds after Shaun Rehn went down in agonised disbelief, clutching his knee, John Platten showed he had lost none of the speed that marked his career with Hawthorn.<br>He spotted Rehn slipping on the rubber plate in the centre when he contested the bounce. This observation brought on slow-motion replay after replay of the saddest incident of the pre-season so far.<br>And before half-time, boundary rider and Crows insider Neil Kerley had news from a source that Rehn would need yet another knee reconstruction and his season was over.<br>Kerley's information was so exclusive that both Rehn's teammate Nigel Smart, at half-time, and AFL chief executive Wayne Jackson, after the match, were still telling interviewers they were unaware of the extent of damage and hoped for the best.<br>Away from the Ansett Cup, the ABC gladdened many a heart on Sunday with its coverage of Perth Glory's comeback win against Sydney United.<br>The camera may have been too far away and commentator Allan Hunter may have done Ian Botham imitations with his continual condemnation of the referee, but as Perth coach Bernd Stange said after the game: ?You have shown good match, seven goals.?<br></font></p>
