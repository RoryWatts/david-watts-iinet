            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A WEEKEND without AFL footy, what to do? I know there is State of Origin but that is becoming as appealing as dining with Senator Mal Colston. The real emotional momentum of proper AFL club footy has been dealt a severe blow.<br>Without five matches on TV the weekend looks blank and as cold as the weather.I've polished the boots just in case the Allies need me, which is a remote possibility given the appalling drop-out rate of injured players and the fact that I was born in Queensland.<br>I'll just gloss over the fact I've only played two social games of real footy and in one of them I had to man up on Ric Ardon of Channel 7, who, being 20cm taller and having actually played the game, gave me a bath.<br>So the AFL-less weekend still stretches out as empty as a Year 3 colouring-in book. How to fill it in, that's the question.<br>I could turn on the TV and watch non-sport. Let's see, there's . . . not much actually, unless it is made in America, recycled or just plain awful.<br>How about turning to some wise sayings posted on the Internet and thus find comfort in philosophy and wisdom? Have a look at these:Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky and I thought, ?Where the heck is the ceiling??<br>nSomeday we'll look back on all this and plough into a parked car.Stupidity got us into this mess - why can't it get us out?Politicians and nappies have one thing in common: they should both be changed regularly and for the same reason.Indecision is the key to flexibility.<br>nIf it ain't broke, fix it till it is.My inferiority complex is not as good as yours.I plan on living forever. So far, so good.Practise safe eating - always use condiments.A day without sunshine is like night.I have kleptomania but when it gets bad, I take something for it.<br>No, that's too silly. How about contemplating how the world has changed? The following may not be true but it is a columnist's right to never let the facts get in the way of a good story.<br>This is allegedly the report of a time-management expert after attending a performance of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony:<br>1. For a considerable period, the oboe players had nothing to do. Their number should be reduced and their work spread over the whole orchestra, thus avoiding peaks of inactivity.<br>2. All 12 violins were playing identical notes. This seems unnecessary duplication and the staff in this section should be drastically cut. If a large volume of sound is required, this could be obtained through use of an amplifier.<br>3. Much effort was involved in playing the 16th notes. This seems an excessive refinement, and it is recommended that all notes should be rounded up to the nearest 8th note. If this were done, it would be possible to use paraprofessionals instead of experienced musicians.<br>4. No useful purpose is served by repeating with horns the passage that has already been handled by the strings. If all such redundant passages were eliminated, the concert could be reduced from two hours to 20 minutes.<br>5. This symphony has two movements. If Schubert did not achieve his musical goals by the end of the first movement, then he should have stopped there. The second movement is unnecessary and should be cut.<br>In light of the above, one can only conclude that had Schubert given attention to these matters, his symphony would probably have been finished by now.<br>This column certainly is. Roll on next weekend.<br></font></p>
