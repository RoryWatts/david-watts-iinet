            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MORE than 13,000 young souls are doing their TEE. Soon they'll be out of their misery and be able to wear what they like, goof off on Rotto, help their mothers with the shopping and all the other things 16 and 17-year-olds like to do.<br>The misery will be far from over for those marking their papers, however. Exam nerves, unexpected questions and just plain ignorance provide nightmares for student and teacher alike.<br>An American history and English teacher called Richard Lederer is a positive thinker, despite this. He says that one of the benefits of being a teacher is receiving the occasional jewel of a student blooper in an essay. And to prove it, he has pasted together a ?history? of the world according to the not-so-brilliant answers in exams from students all over the US.<br>Here is a precis:<br>The inhabitants of Egypt were called mummies. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and travelled by Camelot.<br>The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the Bible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked ?Am I my brother's son?? God asked Abraham to sacrifice Issac on Mt Montezuma. Jacob, son of Issac, stole his brother's birthmark.<br>Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the 10 Commandments. David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the Philatelists, a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of David's sons, had 500 wives and 500 porcupines.<br>Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name. Eventually, the Romans conquered the Geeks. History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long. Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul.<br>Well that makes ancient history pretty clear ... but what of the Middle Ages:<br>King Alfred conquered the Dames, King Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery, King Harold mustarded his troops before the Battle of Hastings. Joan of Arc was cannonized by George Bernard Shaw, and the victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. Finally, the Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the same offence.<br>It goes on ... in midevil times most of the people were alliterate. The greatest writer of the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verse and also wrote literature. Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son's head.<br>The Renaissance, that great time of discovery, is characterised by these gems:<br>Guttenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100-foot clipper.<br>Elizabeth was the Virgin Queen. When she exposed herself before her troops, they all shouted ?hurrah?. Then her navy went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.<br>And did you know?<br>Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music.<br>World War I was caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by a surf, and ushered in a new error in the annals of human history.<br>???<br>I WELCOME the appointment of Elle as WA's new ambassador at large and cordially invite her to open this column officially at a quiet corner table for two in some small, dark restaurant.<br>I just hope she is more intelligent than some of her sister supermodels, who have been credited with the following wise words:<br>?Once I got past my anger toward my mother, I began to excel in volleyball and modelling.? - Gabrielle Reece.<br>?I loved making Rising Sun. I got into the psychology of why she liked to get strangled and tied up in plastic bags. It has to do with low self-worth.? - Tatjana Patitz.<br></font></p>
