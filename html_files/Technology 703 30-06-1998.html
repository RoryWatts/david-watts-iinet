            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHAT Microsoft has taken away from PC users for 21 years, it is now giving back with Windows 98. The commodity is disk space, a resource that can be just as important as processor speed or RAM.<br>The method Win 98 employs is called FAT32, a delightful acronym for 32-bit File Allocation Table.<br>Actually Win 98 with FAT32 is a double-edged sword. Installation of the new operating system upgrade can take between 150 and 200 Mb of space. Use of FAT32 can then reclaim nearly all of that, if not more.<br>Users who might benefit from FAT32 are those who have upgraded to Win 98 from earlier Windows 95 or Windows 3.x systems. Those with the OSR2 release of Win 95 - often called Windows 95B and resident on newer PCs - probably will have FAT32 already. And if they have Internet Explorer 4, there is little reason for them to upgrade.<br>But back to FAT32. Older Windows used FAT16 which was designed in 1977 for MS-DOS when personal computers did not even have hard drives. Everything was stored on floppy disks.<br>FAT16 was fine for that era but these days we have big hard drives - a new PC with 3.2Gb is not unusual. As a result there are serious shortcomings with FAT16. It can waste up to 20 per cent of disk space, or about 400Mb on a typical 2Gb disk.<br>FAT32 uses hard disk space more efficiently. The minimum file size for FAT16 on a 1GB disk, for example, is 32K. For FAT32, it is 4K.<br>Put another way: you might create a 4Kb Word document but when you save it to your hard disk, it might occupy a disk cluster 32Kb in size, depending on how data is distributed. That is, 28Kb of space is wasted.<br>With FAT32, that document would fit neatly into one cluster, wasting no space.<br>Another benefit is that, unlike FAT16, FAT32 is not limited to a 2Gb-per-disk partition.<br>Under FAT16, any drive bigger than 2Gb has to be divided into several smaller virtual disks, each with its own drive letter. With FAT32, what you see is exactly what your PC has - one big hard drive.<br>I converted the hard drives on my PC last week. My 540Mb D: drive had 323Mb free before conversion to FAT32, and 360Mb after - a modest gain.<br>But my 2.1Gb C: drive, which had 680Mb spare before FAT32, showed 1.04Gb free afterwards - more than 300Mb freed up in an operation that took just on 30 minutes. Like any good news story however, there is also bad news. You cannot uninstall Win 98 through your Control Panel after converting. The only way back is via a hard disk reformat which will wipe everything from your disk.<br>Some disk utilities, like certain virus scanners, will not work with FAT32 disks.<br>You cannot operate a dual boot system to an older FAT16 Windows system.<br>And you cannot compress the drive with the DriveSpace utility.<br>However, you can access non-FAT32 files from other computers or drives either on a single PC or network.<br>FAT32 conversion should not be done without thought. Do you really want Win 98? Give yourself some time to make sure you do. If you are happy that you don't want to return to an older Windows, then convert to FAT32.<br>Are you confident enough to reformat your hard drive and reinstall everything from scratch? If so - and reformatting every now and then can make your PC feel like new - then convert.<br>FAT32 may even speed up your PC, but there are no promises.<br>Reaction by users in newsgroups has been varied. Some have noticed slight speed gains, others the exact opposite.<br>All have reported good gains in space, however.<br>To check whether your disk is FAT16 or 32:<br>Go to My Computer. Right click on the disk in question. Click on Properties.<br>To convert to FAT32: Click the Start button, then Programs, Accessories, System Tools and Drive Converter.<br>The converter will run a surface scan before conversion, then defragment (defrag) your disk. It will take between 30 minutes and a few hours. You will need plenty of memory.<br>Although my PC has 32Mb of RAM, I had to run the DOS program memmaker to reshuffle the way memory was used before the conversion succeeded.<br>The newsgroup microsoft.public.win98.pre-release is an excellent resource for those looking for answers.<br></font></p>
