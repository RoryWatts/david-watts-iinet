            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web has hundreds of millions of pages of information and entertainment, but there are some yawning gaps in a medium which promises to expose every stitch in life's rich tapestry.<br>On the one hand, there are countless monuments to modern junk culture with myriad sites about The Simpsons, Star Trek and Pamela Anderson. On the other, there is a great deal of higher-minded content. You can read several versions of the Bible, all Shakespeare's work and Mallory's Morte D'Arthur, to name a tiny few.<br>Somewhere a lot of what might be called middle-brow art has slipped through the net.A significant almost missing link on the Web is a true national symbol, one Sir Leslie Colin Patterson, erstwhile Minister for the Yartz and Inland Rodent Control, and now said to be chairperson of the Australian Chapter of the International Cheese Board.<br>Notice I said almost missing link. The man who gave us the phrases ?I'm as full as a State school hat-rack . . . as full as a bull's bum? does have a cyber-presence. It is not huge but it will grow.<br>You might not be surprised to know this presence is called Sir Leslie Colin Patterson's Internet Tool. You may be surprised to learn - on the other hand - it is the work of an American Internet enthusiast who just also happens to be a huge fan of Sir Les's alter-ego, the supreme Aussie satirist Barry Humphries.<br>David Bruson, a literature and drama student at the University of South Florida in Tampa, said in an e-mail interview this week that, as far as he was aware, his homage to Humphries - Barry Humphries Wired - was unique. It certainly was the only one to have gained any outside attention.<br>And his Sir Les page was about all there was. Certainly, when I checked with the AltaVista search engine I found only Mr Bruson's page and one originating in Britain.<br>The British page simply had a picture of Sir Les and the words: ?There's nothing here, so b . . . off.?<br>The Humphries Wired site also happens to bear the label ?the almost official Web site?. This, Mr Bruson says, is because Humphries fully supports and contributes to it.<br>The Sir Les page - the character I most wanted to track down - is thin on resources.There are wonderful pictures of the disgusting-looking old diplomat, including one of him in a Santa suit fondling a bikini-clad girl said to be his ?secretary of the Yartz?.<br>But none of Sir Les's glittering repartee is there yet. This won't last long, according to Mr Bruson, who admits he has neglected Sir Les in favour of working on his Humphries and Dame Edna pages.<br>?I plan to update Les's Web site in the near future. How about "Virtual Les'? It's taking some time because I want to create the right design,? said Mr Bruson. ?I'm trying to make it kind of porn-site-looking with links to the seediest Web sites on the Net. Perhaps "Sir Les's Guide to Culture on the Internet'.?<br>Which all sounds like it would suit our Sir Les down to a tee.Barry Humphries Wired:<br>users.aol.com/raregems/Sir Leslie Colin Patterson's Internet Tool: users.aol.com/sirles2/les1.htm<br></font></p>
