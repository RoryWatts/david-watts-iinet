            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO young Perth men are creating a virtual storm in the US with a very Australian game that is played online with a Web browser.<br>Simon and Jamie Edis have set up the Ezone Corporation in San Francisco to showcase their CD-like game called Lenny Loosejocks Goes Walkabout.<br>In their own words: ?(Lenny) is unlike any browser based game you've seen - it's 100 per cent graphics and action - not a text based MUD.?<br>Lenny has been consistently voted the No.1 game on Macromedia's Shockrave game site, beating games from SegaSoft, Sony/Tristar and Disney Online. A Lenny fan club boasts more than 5000 members.<br>The refreshing thing about the Lenny game is its Australianness. Once Web surfers have entered the game site and waited for the required Macromedia Shockwave to load, they are presented with colourful, original animations and broad Australian accents, performed by the Edis boys.<br>Jamie and Simon not only run the company responsible for Lenny, they have created the images, done the animations, the voices and programmed the easily followed adventures in Shockwave.<br>Players have to guide Lenny Loosejocks in his travels through the virtual world of Pullyapantsup, Australia.<br>The Edises say players need fast reflexes and a quick mind to get through the arcade-style action games, puzzles and tasks.<br>They claim that at least four hours should be set aside to play the game properly. Arcade games are challenging and original, with names like Cane Toad Explode, Billabong Bunyip, Boomerang Bash and Kanga Boxing.<br>Apart from its originality and Australianness - and the fact that every player can be listed in a ?global hall of fame? - the Edises say the game has many other winning features.<br>It can be played directly on the Web with a Shockwave-optimised browser (now very common), is set up for average 28.8K modems, is free, non-violent, and allows multi-player with the ability to speak not only to other players, but the creators as well.<br>Simon Edis says Lenny is becoming so addictive that typical players are spending five hours at it in a single session.<br>The Edises claim there are no huge downloads involved. The streaming technology of Shockwave allows bigger programs to stream in the background while players are still interacting on screen, meaning no waiting.<br>A benefit of the streaming technology is that it saves a player's progress in background so they can resume games where they left off if they are disconnected or need to take a screen break.<br>The Ezone Corporation has developed more than 500 Internet games and done animations for clients including Universal Online, Fox Home Video, GameSpot, Macromedia, USWeb and Nova Development.<br>Help Desk<br>Lenny Loosejocks Goes Walkabout:<br>www.ezone.com/lennyworld<br>The Lenny Loosejocks Show:<br>www.ezone.com/lennytoon<br>Ezone:<br>www.ezone.com<br></font></p>
