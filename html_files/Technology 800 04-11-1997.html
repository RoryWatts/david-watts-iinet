            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">History of Computing<br>This text-oriented site should just about be essential reading for those new to computers and those who have used them for a time without really knowing much about them. The History of Computing lives at the Your Personal Net pages, a comprehensive Web directory resource with dozens of categories.Headings covered in the history include a chronology of events in the history of microcomputers (dating from 1926), computers: from the past to the present, notable women in computing and a visit to computer exhibit at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. (DW)<br>104 Things To Do With A Banana<br>There are a lot of banana sites out there, including The Bananarchist's Cookbook and pages for collectors of old Del Monte labels, but 104 Things to Do With a Banana takes a G-rated approach to the fruit like that of Native Americans to the buffalo.<br>It extols the fruit as nothing short of manna from Heaven, cataloguing its botany (biggest plant on Earth without a woody stem), some history of its dissemination into the cold climes of North America and Europe, and recipes - lots of recipes - including cream of banana soup and a banana relish.Green fruit is best used in soups and stews but beware, it can cause ?irritation? to the digestive system. The coveted yellow with brown flecks is perfect for salads or just right out of the peel. Because sometimes a banana is just, well, a banana. (WP)<br>The Full Monty Handbook<br>The hilarious British film The Full Monty is taking Perth by storm. But do you know what these unemployed Yorkshire lads are on about when they talk? And did you ever guess at half the things Arfur and Terry used to say in Minder? Unless you are an ex-pat, much of the colourful jargon of the lads and lasses may fall on deaf ears.The Full Monty Handbook can help. It presents plot synopses through the eyes of each desperate character in the language of the film. The colourful slang is linked to a dictionary dealing with popular - rather than correct - English. So you can find out what ?bollocks? or ?lunch box? or even ?lasses? really means.The site is also a good way to get to know the film about jobless steel workers who decide to make some money by stripping; taking it all off in fact. If you've seen and laughed at the film, it's a good way to revisit it. If you haven't, it's a great laugh anyway. (DW)<br>The Lipstick Librarian<br>Shirley Jones gave us Marian the Librarian in The Music Man, Katharine Hepburn was the attractive, feisty librarian who gets Spencer Tracy in Desk Set and, now, Linda Absher brings The Lipstick Librarian to the Web. An updated, classy and glamorous iconoclast, the Lipstick Librarian means to overturn stereotypes by proving once and for all that librarians can be brainy, beautiful - and take a joke.<br>Clad in a snug evening sheath edged in mink, reference book in hand, the Lipstick Librarian prances with all the abandon of a Paris runway model. What makes a Lipstick Librarian? Not money, fame, or a command of AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd Ed.). Rather, it is the ability to ?look fabulous while poking around a dot-matrix printer with a bent paper clip?.<br>The site offers make-up tips (Post-its as a beauty aid), a bibliography ("Circulate THIS!! When Circ Librarians Go Bad?) and a guest book where real-life LLs can comment on their public image. Will males in this female-dominated profession be next? Can the Leatherneck Librarians be far behind?
