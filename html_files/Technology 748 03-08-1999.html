            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN VICTORIAN and Edwardian times, people sent long and well-crafted letters to each other.<br>Often tied with ribbon and stacked neatly in chests, these formed a valuable archive of what people said and thought.<br>The telephone eventually replaced letter writing as the preferred way of communication, but thoughts on paper still have been religiously catalogued and stored to maintain the archives of history.<br>Now we have the perfect medium to keep an active database of our lives.<br>Want to publish a paper? Put it on a Web page. Want to find out what people think of your ideas? Provide a feedback link for e-mail. Better still, provide a chat forum where people can indulge in a digital conversation.<br>Such online chats offer a new way to look at events; an active as well as interactive method of recording history.<br>Great theory, but unfortunately the human race gets in the way. We users have taken to e-mail and chat forums willingly. But we have reinvented the English language to do it.<br>Examples of the shorthand of the digital age:<br>?FWIW: For what it's worth.<br>?IMCO: In my considered opinion.<br>?JOOTT: Just one of those things.<br>?ROTFLOA: Rolling on the floor laughing out aloud.<br>It reminds me of a comedy skit done by both Benny Hill and the Two Ronnies in the 1970s. In it they had a person showing how easy it was to teach English to foreigners as any sentence could be made up of single letters.<br>The question, ?have you any eggs?? could be written: F U N E X. The answer, ?yes I have ham and eggs?, went: S I F M N X.<br>That could be the level of communication we are looking at in the digital age.<br>Last week's Foreign Correspondent on the ABC appeared about to transcend that. It ran a story about the boom in Internet stocks, and focused on the new breed of nerdy millionaires.<br>Anchorwoman Jennifer Byrne had two of her wired interviewees lined up for an online forum at the show's Web site afterwards. She plugged it several times, appropriately a story about online riches deserved online follow-up.<br>And the ABC has left a record of the forum for posterity. Here are some highlights copied from the Web record:<br>?Can anyone explain this kerfuffle??<br>?What about ME??<br>?Most interesting Mr Bond. It's a pity you won't live to see my cyberspace bomb.?<br>There was also a bit of a spat about changing screen colours.<br>But in the first page of the archived Web forum - which was the last page of the discussion - there did not appear to be much sense apart from a suggestion to resume the chat on a chat channel, or to try ICQ.<br>It is unfair to single out Foreign Correspondent because many online chats can look like a rabble. And it just might be an accurate reflection of how we communicate with each other.<br>Foreign Correspondent: www.abc.net.au/foreign/<br></font></p>
