            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">? Football has crossed the boundary into cyberspace. Already Dockers and Eagles fans can access a wealth of information on their clubs and it is going to get better.<br>?DAVID WATTS reports.<br>FREMANTLE did have a win over the West Coast Eagles last season, no matter what the official results say.<br>The Dockers were first into cyberspace - the World Wide Web which connects at least 20 million computer users on the Internet.<br>Fremantle fan Matthew Chalwell constructed his own database of Docker facts before the season even began. Sadly he has just closed it, anticipating an official version on the Net of Docker facts and figures.<br>Like most keen computer-literate compilers of Web ?pages?, Chalwell did his Dockers page unofficially and out of love for his club. But like countless similar Web enthusiasts he found the computer-born hobby became too much, particularly as the Dockers gained popularity.<br>The Eagles unofficial Web page, called Eagle Web, started recently and, in Web parlance, is still heavily under construction.<br>That means features are constantly being added as other Web enthusiasts e-mail the constructors of the page, telling what they want.<br>The Web pages offer WA football fans many facts and figures, opportunities to have their say about their club, occasionally pictures and biographies of players and the all-important club song.<br>Before it went out of business the Dockers page offered the following menu: AFL ladder, ladder positions, I Want to Have My Say (feedback), What's been said this week (by e-mail from fans), player profiles (including pictures), theme song, pledge, half-time entertainment news and pictures and results.<br>The Eagles page promises the following when fully up and running: club history, 1995 results, statistics, sponsor details, player profiles (and pictures ... though Peter Matera has a lot of hair in his, as does Chris Lewis, and Glen Jakovich looks about 18), membership details, club song and honour board.<br>Another WA football page with a big Net following is Bouncedown, put together at the University of WA. It bills itself as the first Australian football site on the Web and appears to aim at a global audience, publishing guides to the game and lists of frequently asked questions.<br>The Internet provides many homesick Australians overseas with news of the game they find hard to get.<br>Curious sports fans from other countries also take an interest in the game. One keen football page author kept count of people looking at his page - more than 11,000 from 25 countries (the Internet allows rough identification of so-called Net surfers because all Net addresses have a country code ... au for Australia, uk for Britain and so forth).<br>Among the 25 countries listed were Japan, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, Denmark, Italy, Israel and Thailand.<br>Other AFL clubs are on the Net, with unofficial pages by fans outnumbering official pages put there by the clubs.<br>Geelong, Essendon, Sydney and Melbourne have unofficial sites, with the Bombers represented twice. And there is an official Bomber site as well as one for Collingwood and the distinctly non-AFL West London Wildcats.<br>The AFL itself has only recently got on the Web, using the electronic arms of the Melbourne Herald-Sun to give itself a guernsey.<br>This official home of football's governing body is well presented but lacks the raw firepower of fans' pages, which, more often than not, take pot shots at the AFL.<br>The AFL gives healthy space to its sponsors and their awards as well as praise for 1995 Brownlow winner Paul Kelly, of Sydney.<br>It also has a brief welcome letter from chairman Ross Oakley, histories of the 16 clubs, fixture lists and space for feedback.<br>A selection of pictures may not please Dockers and Eagles fans ... not one of their heroes can be seen. Instead, Gary Ablett, Wayne Carey and Wayne Campbell hold centre stage.<br>And there is Alex Jesaulenko's great grab in the 1970 grand final, but from ground level so it lacks the drama of the shot so often seen on television.<br>In mid-year the Net became a bloody battlefield as the AFL and fans running football pages collided over the rights to run AFL logos, news of official AFL merchandise and even fixture lists.<br>The AFL took legal action against at least one page in August and the page - called Wil's Footy Page - suspended itself while advice was sought.<br>The AFL had objected to the electronic publication of fixture lists, which it said could not be aired without a licence from the league.<br>However, it did not object to publication of results or other so-called derivations of the fixtures because these were in the public domain, so Wil's Footy Page resumed in good time for the finals.<br>It was the sort of acrimonious debate which many football fans on the Web greeted as unnecessary because they had been publicising the game in a new medium and believed they deserved kudos not writs.<br>Other places on the Net where fans have their often ferocious say are the newsgroups - electronic bulletin boards where like minds congregate to swap information, gossip and abuse.<br>Hot recent topics on the group called rec.sport.football.australian have included Dermott Brereton's retirement, the experimental rules for the night premiership, the draft and, most fiercely, the differences between gridiron and Australian football.<br></font></p>
