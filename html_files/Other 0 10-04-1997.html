            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A FORECAST of stormy weather for the night of Tuesday, April 15, would be appropriate.<br>That is the deadline for a writing contest like no other. The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is dedicated to the memory of Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, who wrote a string of exceedingly bad novels in the 19th century.<br>The most notorious, Paul Clifford, began with the immortal words:<br>?It was a dark and stormy night and the rain fell in torrents ... except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.?<br>Since its publication in 1830, this opening paragraph has been a benchmark of bad writing. It was possibly a dark and stormy night in 1982 when Professor Scott Rice of California's San Jose State University had the demented brainwave to launch the Bulwer-Lytton contest.<br>Only three people entered the contest that year, but thanks to some relentless publicity the judging eventually became an international media event.<br>Penguin Books has now published five editions of collected entries. All this seems to validate the old saying: ?Never overestimate the taste of your audience.?<br>The entry conditions are simple: Write an original and unpublished sentence of any length, although the judges warn that anything over 50 or 60 words is done at the writer's peril.<br>T HE prizes go to the worst piece of writing in several categories - including romance, detective, science fiction and western - as well as an overall winner.<br>Past winners make good reading, er, bad reading ... ah, good fun.<br>Consider the 1996 grand prize winner, written by Janice Estey of Colorado:<br>?"Ace, watch your head!' hissed Wanda urgently, yet somehow provocatively, through red, full, sensuous lips, but he couldn't you know, since nobody can actually watch more than part of his nose or a little cheek or lips if he really tries, but he appreciated the warning.?<br>It leaves the reader breathless, as does the winner of the best-worst western paragraph, by Becky Mushko of Virginia:<br>?Following the unfortunate bucking of his horse when it was startled by the posse's shots, Tex - who now lay in a dishevelled heap in the sagebrush - pushed back his sweat-stained Stetson from one deep-set blue eye, spat a stream of tobacco juice at the nearest cactus, and reflected momentarily that the men approaching him with ropes probably weren't just out for a skip, and - if they were - his freshly broken ankle would have to cause him to decline any entreaties to join them.?<br>Puns are also encouraged with prizes awarded under the Vile Puns heading. Last year's runner-up, by Anthony Buckland of Vancouver, gives the general idea of what can be done.<br>?Baron Frankenstein looked up from his sewing, smiled benignly across the laboratory at his similarly-engaged creation and protege, and called, "Yes, yes! Put on a happy face; tonight will be your first date with the rest of your wife!'?<br>If all that sounds too tempting for your tortured talents, entries can be sent to Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, Department of English, San Jose State University, San Jose, California 95192-0090, USA.<br>Or look up the Web site at http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/#rules<br></font></p>
