            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TRANSPERTH has had good and bad news since it launched its interactive Journey Planner on the Internet early this month.<br>The good news was that there were nearly 9000 visits to the site on the World Wide Web in the first week of operation, including hundreds from the US and others from Canada, Britain and Asia.<br>The bad news was that the opening screen display proved too weighty for some computers - causing freezes and delays - and that addresses required were too exacting.<br>The Journey Planner is the only one of its type in Australia and possibly unique in the world because it combines all forms of public transport.<br>Users key in departure and arrival addresses and the planner presents up to five possible ways to make the journey on public transport.<br>It offers train, bus or ferry routes or combinations of them, and provides exact details of the walking distance from addresses to transport stops.<br>Transperth sources describe public feedback as a bit of a mixture. Complaints about heavy graphics have been countered by expressions of pride that Perth has an Australian first.<br>The entering of addresses in the planner seems to be causing most grief.<br>It is possible to enter exact addresses - like 10 Smith Street, Myaree, to 777 South Terrace, Fremantle - or to be vaguer and just enter Myaree to Fremantle. But if the Journey Planner's highly detailed mapping software does not recognise addresses, it cannot return results.<br>Transperth says common problems occur when people ask for details of trips to or from Perth. The planner needs to have Perth City to act.<br>Similarly it will not process UWA (preferring the full title), or Airport (needing Perth Airport).<br>The planner has the flexibility of allowing people to enter landmarks instead of addresses, but again the planner's software must recognise them to produce results.<br>Feedback either by phone or e-mail would help the site maintainers to fine-tune the planner.<br>One of the fascinating statistics to emerge after the first week of operation was that the average visit to the site requested information on 52 trips.<br>This suggests navigation of Perth might be addictive, or it could say a lot about the site's novelty value in its early days.<br>Transperth says most requests are made between 9am and 4pm, suggesting the bulk of users are school students and working commuters.<br>Surprisingly, 362 American visitors to the site made a total of 14,373 requests for information. And nine from the UK asked for trip details 797 times.<br>The direct URL to the Journey Planner - thus avoiding the graphic-laden start screen - is best accessed at:<br>www.transperth.wa.gov.au/t_ejp.html.<br></font></p>
