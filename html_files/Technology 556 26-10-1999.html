            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE unveiling of a free Encyclopedia Britannica on the Internet last week came at a big price.<br>So many people tried to get free access to the Rolls-Royce of encyclopedias that the Britannica.com Web site hosting all 32 volumes was put out of action.<br>The public thirst for free online information was so great the site slowed to a crawl shortly after Britannica became available on Wednesday morning in Australia. It was replaced by an apology screen soon after and this remained as late as Sunday night.<br>Britannica.com chief executive officer Don Yannias said on the apology screen that public response had ?created a tidal wave of activity?. ?In many ways, we have truly been victims of our own success,? he said.<br>Extra staff and computer hardware have been brought in to cope with the huge demand.<br>The free access to the full text of Britannica is a result of the repackaging of the company's Web presence.<br>Britannica.com - which has hosted a popular directory based on site reviews - is becoming a stand-alone company serving up content for consumers that includes its encyclopedia and selected material from newspapers, magazines, books and other reference works.<br>Britannica.com senior vice-president of product development and editorial Kent Devereaux told online publication BizReport that when the site was running properly visitors could comb through the Web directory and all the new reference material with a single search.<br>Mr Devereaux said Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc would continue to focus on the printed version of the encyclopedia.<br>Britannica.com would also handle the Britannica CD and Britannica DVD products as well as a second Web site, Encyclopaedia Britannica Online, which would continue to target academic markets.<br>Encyclopaedia Britannica Online also offers access to the encyclopedia but users must subscribe and pay about $8 a month.<br>Free access at one site does not mean the end of the subscription-based Encyclopaedia Britannica Online (also known as EB.com). ?In the next year, you will see a lot of enhancements to EB.com,? Mr Devereaux said.<br>The company would add many more features, including specialised research sources such as academic journals and library-database searching.<br>Britannica.com would also aim to enhance EB.com for younger students by adding the pictorially-friendly Comptons.<br>The biggest difference between the free online encyclopedia and the subscription model at EB.com would be in screen advertising.<br>Encyclopedia users at Britannica.com are expected to have to wade through advertising graphics and online sales prompts while EB.com users will be able to surf their site commercial-free.<br>Britannica's radical revamp is attributed to a dramatic fall in sales of its printed volumes.<br>The Chicago company's book sales are said to have dropped about 80 per cent since 1990.<br>Encyclopedia users have turned to CD versions with Microsoft Encarta, especially, included free on most new computers.<br>HELP DESK<br>Britannica.com:<br>www.britannica.com<br>EB online:<br>www.eb.com<br>Free 30-day trial is available at EB.com if Britannica.com is still not working.<br></font></p>
