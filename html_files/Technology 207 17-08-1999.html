            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">COMMUNITY<br>City of Cockburn<br>www.cockburn.wa.gov.au<br>THE City of Cockburn has made its mark on the world ... not quite, but its presence on the World Wide Web is an eye-opener.<br>The attractive use of images, digital manipulation and music has won the city this year's best Web site prize in the WA Municipal Association's Effective Communications Awards.<br>Glenn Hankinson, of Osborne Park company Dow Digital, who helped the council put its site together, said Cockburn now had a well designed, attractive and informative medium for ratepayers.<br>Mr Hankinson praised his Dow team and the council for the use of dynamic technologies such as Flash and Audio on the site.<br>This gave it a vibrant and colourful presence, he said.<br>The highlight is the Flash welcome page.<br>This gives way to an easily navigated and fast conventional site full of information about the Cockburn area and council news and services.<br>Pages for council contacts and e-mail feedback are also provided.<br>MUSIC SOFTWARE<br>Real Jukebox new beta 2.0<br>www.real.com<br>REAL Networks released its first version of Jukebox three months ago to critical acclaim.<br>This updated version is even better and certainly more stable.<br>Real Jukebox is one of the more innovative bits of software to come online in recent times.<br>It allows users to record CDs straight to their hard drives and to manage collections of the music in ways that best suit the user.<br>Jukebox also probes the Web for information about CDs and can play dozens of different types of formats, including the ever present MP3.<br>And above all, it is free in its basic version which is only a 7Mb download.<br>FUN<br>I Resign<br>www.i-resign.com<br>YOU could call this site a homage to quit wit. I Resign puts the spotlight on that vital part of corporate culture ... the resignation letter.<br>It provides samples for those wanting a graceful exit from their jobs, although many of them are more likely to result in the withholding of severance pay, if not immediate attention from company security guards.<br>The important thing is not to take any of it too seriously.<br>And users are asked to submit their resignation letters as well to broaden the human experience.<br>Letters can be serious, but it is probably better if they aren't.<br>Here is an excerpt from the site's example of a gloating resignation letter . .. and it is said to be genuine: ?I've decided not to take up your offer of more money and a new Peugeot.<br>?Actually, I'd rather like to spit on your offer of more money and a new Peugeot.<br>?What sort of idiot do you think I am to even consider accepting your trifling gesture, this pittance, this worst of kind of tokenism? I'm off; outta here ...?<br></font></p>
