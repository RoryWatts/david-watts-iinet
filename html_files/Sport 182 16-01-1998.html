            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CAN anyone tell me how it is possible to have solo synchronised swimming? Who does the solo synchronised swimmer synchronise with?Is it Rocky the cartoon western rock lobster and official mascot of these eighth World Swimming Championships? Or is it the little green men who have so obviously inspired swimming officials to make synchronised swimming a sport?<br>The same little green men have worked their evil way with rhythmic gymnastics, ballroom dancing and figure skating - all wonderful pastimes, but sport . . . I don't think so.<br>I saw solo synchronised swimming for myself on the first day of the championships at Challenge Stadium last week. On day one, the hundreds of people wandering happily around all had the ability to watch solo synchro free from the raised walkway leading from the public entrance gates to the doors of the stadium.<br>It is quite a sight too. Before a solo synchro takes to the water, she (I don't think blokes are into this) does a little prancing and posing poolside to music. Then she dives in gracefully, no doubt to synchronise with Rocky the rock lobster.<br>The next thing you see is a leg, or legs, pointing skywards with toes pointed. Slowly the leg or legs revolve. One can only assume the solo synchro - resplendent in colourful cossie and make-up -- is holding her breath hoping her toenail polish doesn't run.<br>After a fair bit of this, she emerges smiling and bowing and posing while the most complicated scores are flashed on a big screen.<br>If, like me, you took the freebie option, there was no way to know whether your actual paying customers had resort to replay screens with underwater vision of the solo synchros.<br>I HOPE they did, otherwise their hard-earned would have been spent in watching legs arcing out of the water. Really nice legs and really nice movements, but somehow lacking the oomph of divers, water polo players and unsynchronised swimmers like Michael Klim.<br>Anyway, at least I can say I've seen it, and it was not dreadful; just a bit inexplicable.<br>The event I paid to watch was the women's three-metre diving semi-final. I took my children to show them a sport I had always told them I excelled at. My CV includes a first in the 1965 Warwick and District (Qld) primary schools junior diving title. This event consisted of: standing dive (degree of difficulty 0.1), running dive (0.3) and fancy dive. I chose a somersault with half twist because no matter how hard I tried to do a somersault, I couldn't stop twisting. (degree of difficulty, about 0.5).<br>As a true believer in ?the older I get, the better I was? school of thought, I would like to say that it was an impressive victory. But to be honest, I thought for years I had finished second. When I was 18 I met the bloke I thought had beaten me and he said that ?some little bloke? had beaten him with a stupid somersault. He had opted for a back dive.<br>Anyway the real championship diving was a little disappointing. The semi-finalists did not perform their hard dives; the event stipulating they must show skill in the basic dives.It wasn't quite standing dive, running dive and fancy, but it was straightforward . . . and fast and shock, horror, there was no slow-motion replay.<br>That's the problem in this TV world of instant gratification and instant history, you are always looking for a replay screen and missing the reality. The reality was that the warm-ups where about 20 of the world's top divers strutted their stuff in practice, was a lot more enjoyable.<br>Anyway, the diving has got to me and I'm off to Rotto to try to relive 1965. If I could just work out how to do that half twist without ending up in hospital . . .<br></font></p>
