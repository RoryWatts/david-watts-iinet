            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I WENT looking for Dean Kemp, one of my favourite AFL footballers, last week. He had done his shoulder. I needed to know more.<br>The World Wide Web has everything, or so we are led to believe.<br>To get all the information I had to look in as many places as I could.<br>So I downloaded and installed Mata Hari, a light (1.6Mb) software tool that promises to search quickly through all the big engines on the Net - Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos and so on.<br>It did as promised. Within two minutes of typing the words ?Dean Kemp? in the search window I had pages and pages of URLs to look at.<br>The Kemp family in Montana, Iris Kemp in Massachusetts, but not your actual inspirational West Coast midfielder.<br>All that sounds a bit miserable for Mata Hari, but in fact it says a lot about how wayward and disorganised the information on the web can be.<br>It is not Mata Hari's fault that Dean Kemp lurks at the West Coast Eagles and AFL sites virtually unseen. Both have excellent biographies on the champion, but no big search engine appears to have picked them up with their robots which scan the Net every minute to compile search indices.<br>This is the risk every Net surfer takes when searching this vast medium. A desktop utility like Mata Hari can actually only serve to help.<br>Despite failing to find Kemp, it did have a thrilling, high-speed go at the job.<br>Mata Hari is a Windows NT, Windows 95 and 98 application. It is being distributed and supported solely via the Internet. The complete version 1.02 software may be downloaded for a free 30-day evaluation at: thewebtools.com.<br>After 30 days it will cost about $60 to register and will allow searching with up to 142 engines at once.<br>Mata Hari's makers, the WebTools Company, claims this ability to search 142 engines simultaneously makes it the most powerful search tool available.<br></font></p>
