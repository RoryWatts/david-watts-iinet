            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I WEAR an eye-patch because of double vision.<br>When I take it off I see see things things twice twice.<br>I took it off just then to demonstrate what I mean. It's safely back on now, so no need to worry.<br>But I must admit I took it off on Saturday night to watch the rugby union World Cup quarter final between Wales and Australia from Cardiff.<br>Thus I was able to see it twice, once on Foxtel and once on Channel 7.<br>Foxtel showed the Wallaby victory live and had commercials only at half-time.<br>The commentary was from an Englishman and a Welshman and was steady and relatively unemotional - except when referee Colin Hawke missed Tim Horan's blatant knock-on that led to George Gregan scoring Australia's third try and made the score a very flattering 24-9.<br>Everyone got emotional about that. Perhaps Mr Hawke was wearing an eye-patch or two.<br>Foxtel's coverage was so unbiased, smooth and sane that I switched to Seven when Ben Tune body-surfed in for a try after following up a clever, skidding kick from Stephen Larkham mid-way through the second half.<br>And what joys Seven had. It was just showing the teams lining up for the national anthems at the start and was panning across the boys from Wales.<br>It was not a pretty sight. Most of the forwards would make West Coast's Scott Cummings look like a skinny wretch. Axed Western Bulldog James Cook could happily put on 15kg if he wanted to switch codes.<br>The sight of the Welsh supported the AAPT Smart Chat commercial which features former Wallaby great Mark Ella and a bloke who is supposed to know nothing about the game.<br>?Have you ever seen Wales play?? Ella asks the bloke.?No I haven't,? he replies. ?Wales are animals,? says Ella. ?Yes I know. A lot of people think they are fish,? counters the bloke.<br>Seven then showed the Australians. My wife and children fled the room in horror.<br>It got on with the game (which was nearly finished on Foxtel) and suddenly the first half became much more exciting and dramatic than the one Foxtel had shown.<br>Funny that, because both used exactly the same vision and it was exactly the same defence-dominated scrap in the rain.<br>But Gordon Bray, Chris Handy and Simon Poidevin are all excellent graduates from the McAvaney-Roberts school of drama, and they were barracking for the Wallabies a fair bit of the time - they probably wear eye-patches, too.<br>Now I like rugby. I know that a lot of West Australians are baffled by it. They think it's about a lot of boofy blokes diving on the ball and the referee breaking it up and awarding a penalty for an unfathomable reason.<br>Whereas we who have played it actually know for certain it's about a lot of boofy blokes diving on the ball and the referee breaking it up and awarding a penalty for an unfathomable reason.<br></font></p>
