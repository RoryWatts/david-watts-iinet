            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE inevitable conclusion after watching four hours of the Super Bowl on SBS yesterday is that Americans do not like sport that much.<br>They love razzamatazz, however.<br>Cher sang the national anthem. Stevie Wonder and Gloria Estefan provided the half-time show.<br>About 150 million viewers watched the game on TV in the US. It was telecast to more than 140 countries in 17 languages and was available to more than 800 million people around the world.<br>Advertisers paid $5 million to the ever-needy Rupert Murdoch for a 30 second commercial on his Fox television network.<br>Fireworks exploded from the scoreboard after every touchdown and field goal.<br>The simple act of a straight 30m kick at goal resulted in an orgy of self-congratulation by the players. The post-touchdown celebrations were even bigger.<br>A Denver player who simply did his job and caught the ball from the Atlanta kick-off, kept the ball as a trophy and snuggled up to it as he ran off the field for yet another break.<br>If AFL players reacted in similar fashion and danced en masse after every score or had mass huddles after a good mark or kick, the game could run all day.<br>American football is a tough, violent-looking game of human chess, but there is very little actual action compared with soccer, Australian Football or either code of rugby.<br>When viewed in highlight packages, it is a game of immense beauty, savagery and heroic athleticism.<br>When viewed for all four hyped-up hours it is a bit of a bore as a sport. Perhaps this is why it requires only two commentators to keep track of the game, compared with the four or five needed for a breathless game of Australian Football, for example.<br>Thankfully, SBS did not fall too much for the hype and provided a rough and ready anchor man for its presentation. The bearded Peter Fitzimmons seemed constantly amazed by what he saw and heard from the Fox coverage.<br>Statements by the Americans that the Super Bowl winners would be world champions, earned this sign-off from Fitzimmons: ?It would be good for more people to play this game in Australia during the next millennium, then it would be nice to make Americans earn the tag of world champions.?<br>It echoed the sentiments of comedian John Cleese, who has stated that one of his misgivings about Americans is that they do not invite anyone else when they have a world championship.<br>What Australia can learn from the Super Bowl is hard to say. Its scale of hype almost defies comparison.<br>The only country which has really adopted American football on a big scale is Canada, although it modified the rules, then decided it was not nearly violent enough and stuck with ice hockey.<br>But Gloria Estefan and Stevie Wonder at half-time ... I'd like to see that.<br>By the way, Denver won easily.<br></font></p>
