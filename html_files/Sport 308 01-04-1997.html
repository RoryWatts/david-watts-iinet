            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 7 should rate Fremantle matches MA, for adults only. Rather than a V for violence, S for sex scenes or A for adult themes, the games should attract a new tag - K for kicking.<br>Children, particularly those learning to kick straight, should not be allowed to watch Fremantle's all-too-regular botch-ups in front of goal.<br>At Optus Oval on Saturday, the Dockers showed what footy excitement is all about. That's excitement as in heart- attack material.<br>Gerard Neesham's boys should have had the Western Bulldogs squared away by the third quarter but they had to wait until Winston Abraham's freakish 60m winner in the last minute.<br>Not that TV viewers needed a Fremantle heart-stopper to excite them in this feast of AFL football.<br>It started in the MCG rain on Thursday night with Melbourne beating premier North Melbourne.<br>ABC radio commentator Drew Morphett was heard to say that North's 7.13 was a Docker-like score. The Roos will have to try harder to match the real thing of 10.20.<br>From that shock opener to yesterday's magnificent Essendon victory over Carlton in front of 82,000 at a sunny MCG, it was TV sport at its very best.<br>Try these highlights and then wonder why anyone would want to buy pay-TV to watch rugby league:<br>?Peter Matera's boundary line-hugging goal against Sydney.<br>?Ben Cousins crashing into free space from nowhere to kick morale-boosting goals in the same game.<br>?The Subiaco crowd's heartfelt applause for Swan champion Paul Roos when he was taken off on a stretcher.<br>?Dennis Cometti's observation that Sydney champion Paul Kelly is so courageous he plays as if he is using someone else's body.<br>?Tony Modra leading at the speed of light against Brisbane and kicking seven.<br>?Matt Richardson's speed and Nick Daffy's snap-happy shooting to help Richmond pip Geelong.<br>?Essendon's amazing keep-it-offs that lasted two minutes, culminated in a goal and victory over Carlton.<br>In the not-so-happy section we had:<br>?The great complainer, Greg Williams, shoving an umpire aside in a bad-tempered outburst after the siren yesterday.<br>?A very silly layout for Seven's Footy Panel that had Gerard Healy grinning like a galoot as he snuggled up to Rex Hunt.<br></font></p>
