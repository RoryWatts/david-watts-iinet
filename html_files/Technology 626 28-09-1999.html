            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A MAJOR educational institution is playing sex games on the Internet - but they have nothing to do with the pornography industry.<br>The Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States has created an online game which it hopes will help people better understand issues about online identity.<br>The game, which it calls the Turing Game, is based on the following questions that have arisen with the increasing use of e-mail and chat groups:<br>?Do men and women behave differently online?<br>?Can you tell who is a man and who is a woman on the Net based on how they interact with others?<br>?Can you tell how old someone is, or determine their race or national origin?<br>The Turing Game Web site allows users to register and participate in what is a global experiment.<br>Georgia Tech says at the game site: ?In the online world, as in the real world, issues of personal identity affect how we relate to others.<br>?Culture in online environments is created by these understandings and misunderstandings.<br>?As the Net grows not only in size but in diversity, we must take these issues into account as designers and citizens of this new medium.?<br>The Turing Game will allow a panel of registered users to pretend to be a member of some group, such as women.<br>Some of the users, who are women, will try to prove that fact to their audience. Others will be men, trying to masquerade as women.<br>An audience of both genders will try to discover who the imposters are, by asking questions and analysing the panel members' answers.<br>Games will cover aspects of gender, race or any other cultural marker of the users' choice.<br>Users will be able to play the Turing Game as much or as little as they want and can stop any time.<br>Transcripts of most games will be made available at the game site immediately after panels have played.<br>Georgia Tech has warned potential participants to take care with what they say and how they treat other panellists, even though some games will be private and not released on the Web and even though participants will hide behind pseudonyms.<br>The transcripts can be subpoenaed by US courts and the game's creators have appealed for users not to resort to slander or threats.<br>Turing Game:<br>www.cc.gatech.edu/elc/turing/index.html<br></font></p>
