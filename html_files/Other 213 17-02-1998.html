            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Blame it on Saddam Hussein. Everybody else finds the Iraqi dictator a convenient scapegoat.<br>I sat down last Tuesday with the intention of devoting the entire night to research on the Bill Gates pie ambush in Brussels and a consequent analysis of the thoughts of the Net community on such. The resulting trove of information was to have been fodder for this column ? in a deep and meaningful way, of course. And in the end the pie-thrower is basically what you get. But on the way I found again just what a diverting and fascinating medium the Web can be.<br>Because our PM John Howard had rallied to the battle cry from Wee Willy Clinton and decided to send troops to the Gulf - one possible side-effect being the relegation of Monica Lewinsky from the front pages - I first had to check all the latest Gulf biffo developments.In 30 minutes I paid your typical news junkie's visits to CNN, the BBC,USA Today and the Washington Post. Imagine trying to do that without a computer, the Net or a lot of money. Just for a top-up, I went to the Reuters newsagency feed supplied at the Time-Warner Web conglomeration.<br>Yes, plenty of Saddam and not too much Monica there. But wait; out of the corner of my eye I spot the words ?pie?, ?Gates? and ?exclusive?. A distant bell rang. Ah yes this is what I was supposed to be doing all the time. The exclusive interview with the pie-thrower was at Time magazine's online nephew The Netly News.<br>A quick click there and I was suddenly engrossed in the tale of 52-year-old Noel Godin, an author, actor and film historian who just loves taking the puff out of celebrities - particularly those he sees as empty vessels - by smacking them in the chops with cream pies. He has whacked quite a few European TV and music celebs.<br>Now Godin does not own a computer nor does he know what a URL is. He is probably one of the happy ones who is technologically challenged. So it was not an aborted de-installation of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 nor ISP trouble with FrontPage 98 that drove him to ambush Mr Gates.<br>?(I chose Bill Gates) because in a way he is the master of the world and then because he's offering his intelligence, his sharpened imagination and his power to the governments and to the world as it is today - that is to say gloomy, unjust and nauseating,? Godin said. Interested to find out more about the man, I plugged Godin's name into AltaVista, Excite and WebCrawler. But apart from an excellent feature in the LA Times, there was little.<br>Then I learned something new. I have subscribed to a handful of Usenet newsgroups since I first connected to the Net but have always used them sparingly because of the self-opinionated twaddle and bad manners that drives many discussions.<br>From the Startingpage site I found the Deja News search engine that enables you to tune into any number of newsgroup discussions about a specific topic, thus avoiding the need to wade through hundreds of kilobytes of irrelevant chatter.<br>There is certainly a lot about Godin's ambush on Mr Gates. But as I have run out of room I can't bring you the range of views about the incident. Instead, why not flick to the Help Desk and have a go yourself. You may even want to join in.<br>That's the beauty of the Net - countless ways to find things and countless views to ponder.<br></font></p>
