            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web is starting to play a bigger part in Australian political life.<br>All levels of government now use Web sites to distribute information such as press releases, policies and public service announcements.<br>It is an acknowledgment that the Web's million-plus constituency of mainly educated, white collar professionals cannot be ignored.<br>Today's Federal Budget will be on the Web at several sites from 5.30pm, after Treasurer Peter Costello finishes reading it in Parliament.<br>The Budget statements will be in Adobe Acrobat format (pdf) to begin with, meaning interested surfers will need the Acrobat Reader. The Government's main Budget site has provided download links.<br>The full Budget will also be available from Government Info shops on PC disks which will have full search and retrieval functions.<br>Another area where the public needs information is the contentious one of native title. This has been high on political agendas since the High Court's Mabo decision, and has been reinforced by the Wik judgment.<br>The Native Title Tribunal has a wide-sweeping and informative Web site with an invaluable question and answer section to help people understand the issue.<br>Among questions the site tries to answer are: what is native title; who has it; where does it exist; how is it extinguished; what does the tribunal do; and how do people apply for title.<br>Federal Government Web information extends to full biographies of all members, including disgraced Queensland Independent Senator Mal Colston.<br>Curiously, there appears to be a lack of lampooning sites that usually spring up when politicians achieve notoriety. Paul Keating, John Howard and Pauline Hanson have all had this dubious honour, but not Senator Colston.<br>The parliamentary library has an exhaustive biography that might help people get under the Senator's skin a little.<br>URLs<br>Federal Budget - www.agps.gov.au/budget/<br>www.treasury.gov.au - www.finance.gov.au<br>Native Title Tribunal - www.nntt.gov.au/<br>Mal Colston (parliamentary library) - par18.aph.gov.au/mps/co-005.html<br></font></p>
