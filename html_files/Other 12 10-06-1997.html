            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Barrister Stuart Littlemore could hardly be said to be dashing and debonair.<br>Yet one woman says she would love to have his baby.<br>Nor does he come across as much more than smarmy and cynical.<br>But there are those who would make him governor-general.<br>To many he is a trivial nit-picker who doesn't apologise for his mistakes.<br>Why then are there people who think he should be Australian of the year?<br>Littlemore hosts the ABC's Media Watch at 9.15pm on Mondays.<br>He has a small audience for the 15 minutes in which he pulls the nation's media to bits for their mistakes, commercialism and hypocrisy.<br>The audience may be small but it's certainly talkative. On the Internet, Littlemore is something of a cult hero.<br>The woman who wanted his baby, the G-G nomination and the Oz of the year hope were all expressed in the aus.tv newsgroup where Netizens come to chat and argue about a diverse range of subjects from how to subscribe to cable to what the words were to the F-Troop theme.<br>Media Watch and Littlemore's acerbic style, plus his almost weekly conquests over sloppy journalism, used to occupy about a quarter of the postings to aus.tv.<br>So a group of regular Littlemore admirers decided to create the aus.media-watch newsgroup. It has never meant to be a clone of their hero's TV program but much of its discourse concerns what Littlemore gets up to.<br>It was fitting, then, that aus.media-watch was born at the same time as Littlemore caught Channel 7's Today Tonight faking footage of Christopher Skase's hideout, portraying Barcelona as Majorca.<br>Since then Littlemore's forays into Ray Martin's interview with his boss's son, James Packer, his spotlight on Kerry Packer's ambitions concerning the Fairfax newspaper group, and the demolition of Sydney talkback host Alan Jones, have all had the newsgroup in cyberchattering raptures.<br>The Littlemore adulation has created an interesting phenomenon. We now have people watching the man who watches the media. Along the way many users are finding the newsgroup a good place to air their own views on the media.<br>Like Littlemore, what they have to say is rarely congratulatory.<br>Newsgroup users share Littlemore's scorn for Ray Martin, 60 Minutes and commercial TV news. Being Netizens, they also tend to bare their teeth whenever the Net gets bad press - as if nothing bad is ever found in cyberspace, or if it is, why report it?<br>Littlemore as a cult hero may not have been possible without the wide conversational opportunities offered by the Net.<br>Which is not bad for a man whose show was described by Melbourne University lecturer Chris Healy this way: ?It (Media Watch) simply passes off its notions of good taste as universal. Behind its firm and satiric judgments alike lies an unacknowledged appeal to a middle-class consensus. It is indeed precisely middle-brow people who most readily legislate on matters of taste for others.?<br>HELP DESK<br>Newsgroup: A bulletin board on the Net devoted to a particular topic. There are more than 14,000 on every subject you can think of (and some you'd rather not).<br>Netizens: Members of the electronic community of the Internet.<br>In Defence of Stuart Littlemore:<br>www.csu.edu.au/faculty/arts/commun/jea/ajr/elgar.htm<br>Watching Media Watch:<br>www.mcs.mq.edu.au/Staff/mwark/warchive/<br>Australian-HES/cs-media-watch.html<br></font></p>
