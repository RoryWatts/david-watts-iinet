            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NOTHING is simple. I planned to write today about how the Internet has grown from a nerdy haven into a sophisticated business-friendly medium.<br>I was going to go back four years when the coolest things you could see on Web pages were NASA satellite images or live shots of a fish tank in a university lab.<br>I was going to contrast that to today when you can tap your credit card details into a page to buy anything from a pizza to a computer.<br>I was even going to suggest that Communications Minister Richard Alston's talk of a wired Australia with an eye on e-commerce was a worthy and workable vision.<br>Then I remembered that Senator Alston's vision also includes Net censorship designed to stop adults accessing what would be legal material in the offline world; that would be ineffective because his un-named technology to block and filter this content would be bypassed easily; that its implementation could slow down the Net and make it more expensive, and that no one in the Net industry nor thousands who are connected actually believe it is necessary.<br>Does the world want the Net to be some vast shopping channel? Is it happy to have its Web surfing experience dominated by Microsoft or AOL and their portals which direct them down one-dimensional paths?<br>To counter this, the people who pioneered the medium with free, open-source software are now releasing tools that will allow even more interaction on the Net.<br>The BBC reported last week on three important breakthroughs - the GNU interface to the Linux operating system, the Amaya Web browser and a program called Third Voice.<br>GNU went on sale in Britain for half the price of Windows98. It puts a user-friendly interface on Linux, allowing users to operate the complexities of a superior Unix-based system as simply as if they were driving Windows or a Mac.<br>The Amaya browser from the World Wide Web consortium allows users to add features to other users' Web sites. The W3C, the body that tries to set standards for the Web, says that Amaya has a feature called update checking, which notifies users when pages they want to publish have been updated by another user. ?This can be seen as the first step toward a cooperative authoring tool,? says the W3C.<br>Third Voice is a commercial venture from California but based on cooperative development of the Web, and may be an answer to correcting the so-called facts put out by hate sites and the like.<br>On one hand, the Net is becoming the greatest shopping arcade on Earth. On the other, it is further enhancing the ability of people to communicate and cooperate.<br>Which side will win? Is it even a war? Will both faces of the Net continue to grow?<br>Nothing is simple.<br>HELP DESK<br>GNU:<br>www.gnu.org<br>Amaya:<br>www.w3.org/Amaya<br>Third Voice:<br>www.thirdvoice.com<br></font></p>
