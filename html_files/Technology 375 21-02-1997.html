            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I AM addicted to the Internet. There is no way round it. My eyes are getting bigger, redder and weaker from staring at the screen until obscene hours. My bottom is burgeoning from spreading on the seat in front of said screen.<br>It's fascinating, the Net. All the accumulated knowledge of humanity seems to be filtering into the phone lines that allow more than 40 million people around the world - many of them with big, weak, red eyes and burgeoning bottoms - to pass on wisdom to each other.<br>The sum of this wisdom is becoming greater than its parts. We Netizens, as we like to call ourselves, can read six different editions of the Bible, various versions of the Koran, the complete works of Shakespeare and Jane Austen; we can see satellite pictures of every corner of the globe, find out what the CIA makes of Denmark and other countries; read more than 4000 different newspapers, and find the names and biographical details of every actor who starred in thousands of different films.<br>It's a treasure trove. I made an e-mail pen pal of a bloke in Washington DC and he put me on a group discussion mailing list with a group of his fellow hotel managers throughout the US.<br>They appear addicted to the Net too. I fancy that if you're staying at one of their hotels and ask for room service you'd get the following response: ?Room service ... what can they mean? Can't those pests tell I'm looking at pictures of Elle MacPherson? The nerve of some people.?<br>The hotel managers circulate their mailing list every couple of days. It's always full of jokes and funny stories. The latest one follows.<br>Now, no peeking at the bottom please. This is a serious questionnaire:<br>Follow the directions exactly. It's a numbers game that works only if you don't cheat. You will be glad you followed the rules.<br>1) pick a number from 1-9.<br>2) subtract 5.<br>3) multiply by 3.<br>4) square the number (multiply by the same number).<br>5) add the digits until you get only one digit (i.e. 64= 6+4=10=1+0=1).<br>6) if the number is less than 5, add five. Otherwise subtract 4.<br>7) multiply by 2.<br>8) subtract 6.<br>9) map the digit to a letter in the alphabet (1=A, 2=B, 3=C, 4=D etc).<br>10) pick a name of a country that begins with that letter.<br>11) take the second letter in the country name and think of an animal that begins with that letter.<br>12) think of the colour of that animal.<br>Now if you've followed the questions faithfully in order the chances are you have ... a grey elephant from Denmark.<br>Uncanny isn't it? (Actually I ended with a brown echidna - but it was from Denmark).<br>So the Net is not just some mindless toy. It has uses you know, and great intellectual potential. The only drawback at the moment is that real live people are allowed to use it and let their brains roam free. Thus we get grey elephants from Denmark.<br>???<br>FROM much the same people who brought us grey Danish elephants, here are some collected wisdoms, which at the very least would make great bumper stickers:<br>Be nice to your kids, they'll choose your nursing home. There are 3 kinds of people: those who can count and those who can't. Don't use a big word where a diminutive one will suffice. Every morning is the dawn of a new error.<br>For people who like peace and quiet: a phoneless cord. Madness takes its toll. Ever stop to think, and forget to start again? I will be off now to take my medication and log on to the Net.<br></font></p>
