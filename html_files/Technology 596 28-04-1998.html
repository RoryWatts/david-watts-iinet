            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">To state the bleeding obvious, we live in an imperfect world. If it was perfect, then Microsoft's Windows 98 - due for release in June - would not crash during a public demonstration.<br>It is precisely what happened at the Comdex show in Chicago last week. To make matters more imperfect, the proud overseer of the embarrassment was Microsoft boss Bill Gates.<br>He giggled a shade nervously after an assistant plugged in a scanner to a 98-powered PC, promised that the software would recognise the device automatically ? and, oh no, the blue screen signifying a crash. The assistant kept things light with the old salesman's patter of ?moving right along?, and Mr Gates - in that well-known Kermit the frog voice - suggested this was why 98 was not being released right now. The crowd went into raptures.<br>It was on the TV news last Tuesday night, but you can see it yourself over and over on Quick Time streaming video at the CNN report of the crash. Windows 98 will be released of course, and maybe the plug-and-play accident will never be repeated. The software's ability to recognise new devices plugged into a Universal Serial Bus at the back of the PC is one of its big selling points.<br>To be perfectly fair, Mr Gates and his assistant were able to do something I have not managed in four months of using 98's beta releases ? crash it. It is a very stable and flexible operating system upgrade and noticeably faster than the Windows 95 it aims to replace.Critics have said 98 is the system Microsoft meant to release when it went bananas with hype during the launch of 95.<br>And what a demonstration of imperfection that was, until users realised it would do the job as long as they forked out for some serious processor and RAM upgrades.<br>Examples of imperfection abound in the computer world, particularly where it merges with the Internet.<br>nWho has not experienced a browser crash? Maybe users of the old text-based Lynx could put their hands up, but the vast majority of users with Netscape or Internet Explorer have certainly had the sinking feeling of a lockup, or even the need for a reboot.<br>nWho has not been overwhelmed by irrelevant sites while looking for something specific with a search engine? The theory that smart indexing robots will form neat databases is often exploded by HTML authors who try to trick them with misleading descriptions of their pages so they can register more hits.<br>nWho has not been bedevilled by promising new technology such as JavaScript or Dynamic HTML while browsing? Either your surfing session slows to a crawl, you're bombarded with error messages, or you can't see the page at all.<br>nWho thinks video on the Web is a bit of a joke, even at 56K? Sure you can go to places such as the AFL Netcast page and call up three-minute highlight packages of your favourite game, but it looks like stop-gap animation ? and it still has Sandy Roberts yelling in the foreground.<br>nWho finds URLs hard to remember or write down, making the surfing experience a bit like an exam nightmare? For example, Eddie Maguire on Channel 9's Footy Show tells viewers they can visit the show's site at www.footyshow.ninemsn.com.au, but in reality that address only gets you near the actual site. The real Footy Show URL is one that Einstein might be hard-pressed to remember.<br>The US Web giant cnet has just put out a special feature dealing with the seven wonders of the Net. The context is not so much the wonder of the exciting medium, but the wonder that we can do anything with it at all. But in the end such quibbling fails to recognise that, imperfect as it is, this virtual world still has much more going for it than against it.<br></font></p>
