            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ECSTATIC is probably too tame a word to describe the way Sri Lanka presented itself to the world on the Internet yesterday.<br>No prose too purple or language too lush could properly convey the joy flowing from its World Wide Web sites at the World Cup cricket victory over Australia.<br>Only it was not a win, it was a bashing, a drubbing and between the lines a vindication and revenge for the painful Sri Lanka tour here last summer with its allegations of chucking, ball tampering, sledging and bullying.<br>Most of all it appeared a just desert for Australia's boycott of the Sri Lankan leg of the cup, when Australia cited security fears in the civil war-torn island as the reason.<br>Then, Sri Lankan commentators called Australian cricketers liars, wimps, cheats and bullies and have since written that Sri Lanka would show us who were the real champions of one-day cricket.<br>No one outside Colombo and Kandy really took them seriously. But they were right and they loved rubbing it in on the World Wide Web.<br>The country's biggest English-language newspaper, the Daily News, runs a Web site rated one of Point.com's top 5 per cent. It is simple, newsy, always up to date and contains some of the most colourful and biased cricket writing in the world.<br>Normally cricket can be found in its rightful place, the sport link on the paper's Net edition front page.<br>Yesterday, not surprisingly, it wiped out the Hot News section. There was a graphic of the champions with the Wills World Cup and pointers to blanket coverage under headlines such as ?Sri Lanka conquers cricket's Mount Everest? and ?... bash the Aussies by seven wickets?.<br>The paper's colourful cricket commentator Elmo Rodrigopulle wrote: ?When victory was achieved, there was as usual, a lot of merry-making with fire crackers being lit and people in every Sri Lankan home clapping and shouting and hugging each other in victory celebrations, and the merry-making going on until the wee hours of the morning.<br>?Buses were very few on the roads and the bus that I travelled in was empty with me being the only passenger. Streets were deserted from the time the game began, with all people either glued to their radios or television.?<br>The Sri Lankan Cricket Board congratulated the team in huge type on its World Cup page and gave the full scoreboard.<br>Sri Lanka: http://www.<br>lanka.net/cgi-bin/index2.html<br></font></p>
