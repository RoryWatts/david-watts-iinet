            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PAULINE HANSON has certainly stirred up Perth. You can find out for yourself why you hate or love the Queensland MP at a variety of Web sites.<br>The official Pauline Hanson home page has press releases, parliamentary speeches, excerpts from the book, The Truth, and feedback forums for support and hate mail.<br>The unofficial Pauline Hanson home page looks at the politician from a different view. It portrays her in an animated GIF as Adolf Hitler.<br>A search with AltaVista using the words Pauline Hanson will reveal dozens of sites which contain the MP's maiden speech in Parliament that brought her to national prominence. There are also several essays about her views.<br>???<br>THE World Wide Web is a great resource. The US Library of Congress is being catalogued there, several versions of the Bible are online, as well as many different translations of the Koran. Doctors track the latest developments to find cures for cancer.<br>However, site creator Rob Spearman, an American fan of the Red Dwarf comic sci-fi TV show, has thrown his energy into producing a program that will read URLs backwards.<br>This staggering advance is available through his !sdrawkcaB page. A user keys in the address of a desired URL, and, hey presto, the text and images are rendered backwards. So, if you type in www.yahoo.com, you end up looking at oohaY.<br>Mr Spearman says he decided to take the Web backwards because he wanted ?to introduce a little surreal silliness? into surfers' days.<br>He does this with a program written in Perl and refuses to divulge the source code. In his own words: ?No, it's mine, all mine. Muahahaha.?<br>Visitors to his site have heaped praise on being able to see Web pages in reverse ... at least the e-mails that Mr Spearman have published are the complimentary ones.<br>Some are even written backwards.<br>Typical of surfers' reactions is this one: ?Your filter is not only the 100 per cent least useful device on the Web, it is also incredible beyond belief.?<br>WestWeb thinks one way to throw a spanner in Mr Spearman's works is to build only palindromic Web pages. However, the scope for sites about Glenelg, kayak paddling or those stating ?able was I ere I saw Elba?, is limited.<br>In the meantime, it is gnizama.<br>???<br>PERTH journalist Tom Henshaw is using the Web in an educational and historical fashion at his newly created Rhodesians at War site.<br>Henshaw, a Zimbabwean expatriate, is looking for global input to a running history of the civil war that tore down the old Rhodesia.<br>He is looking for ?everyday stories of life and love under the gun? with the aim of publishing them, and people's pictures, on the Web.<br>???<br>US television network ABC has decided to tackle rivals CNN and NBC on the Web with its ABCNEWS site. It is a tight, well designed site, but the real interest for Australian surfers is not so much the American news, but links to the ESPN sports zone and Mr Showbiz entertainment pages.<br>Mr Showbiz is running a fascinating list of the top movies of every well known genre and surfers' top-100 films.<br>URLs<br>Pauline Hanson official - www.gwb.com.au/onenation/hanson<br>Backwards URL - www.smeg.com/backwards/<br>Unofficial - www.zip.com.au/-rocket/hanson.htm<br>Rhodesians at war - www.iinet.net.au/-henshaw/<br>ABC - www.ABCNEWS.com<br>Cannes - worldmedialive.com/cine/Cannes97/indexva.shtml<br>RealAudio sites - www.ozemail.com.au/-goan/radio.html<br>Choice IAP survey - www.sofcom.com.au/ACA/ISPsurvey.htm<br>Happy Water - www.q-net.net.au/-happywater/<br></font></p>
