            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF YOU cannot be useful, be entertaining. This piece of advice comes from the staff of InfiNet in the US and is directed at World Wide Web users who want to be cool.<br>InfiNet runs one of the most popular compilations of cool sites on the Web. Its Cool Site of the Day site is a bookmark must because of its variety and innovation.<br>And for the second successive year InfiNet is looking for the coolest sites of the year. Five finalists have been chosen in nine Web-related categories and have been facing their judges - the Internet community - for the past month.<br>InfiNet is calling for votes so it can present awards to the nine winners on October 3 at a multimedia ceremony in New York.<br>The nine categories are Cool Site of the Year, Still Cool Site of the Year, Personal Web Site of the Year, Cool Design, Cool Site Script, Cool Web Designer, Cool Innovation, Cool Search Engine and Cool Browser.<br>Surfers are asked to check a box next to their favoured nominee in any or all categories and submit. An InfiNet security program will allow only one submission per user.<br>What is or is not cool is a matter of taste of course. The presentation of InfiNet's voting site certainly gives the impression that these are young, hip choices.<br>And the prevalence of sites like Damaged Californians and Salon in the Site of the Year awards, or Crash Site and Hotwired among the Still Cool nominees, does nothing to alter that opinion.<br>But there are several mainstream sites in various categories as well which help give the Cool Site awards a wider profile on the ever-changing Web.<br>For instance, the straitlaced Discovery Channel - a site rounding out the shows produced by this cable-TV operator - is one of the starters for Cool Site of the Year.<br>It also turns up in the Cool Design of the Year section.<br>The innovation, search engine and browser awards are packed with familiar favourites to all Web users.<br>The innovation nominees include Java, Real Audio and Shockwave. Among the search engines are Yahoo, Lycos and Alta Vista. And the browsers ... no prizes for guessing that Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer are among them.<br>Surfers can cast their votes at: cool.infi.net/csoty.html<br>URLs<br>TO SEE what you think of InfiNet's Cool Site nominees, surf along to these URLs.<br>Cool Site of the Year<br>Damaged Californians www.damagedcalifornians.com<br>Discovery Channel www.discovery.com<br>iMusic www.imusic.com<br>Salon www.salon1999.com<br>Word www.word.com<br>Still Cool<br>Crash Site www.crashsite.com<br>Dominion www.scifi.com<br>Hotwired www.hotwired.com<br>Internet Underground Music Archive www.iuma.com<br>Total New York www.totalny.com<br>Personal Web Site<br>Gurl www.gurl.com<br>The Obvious www.theobvious.com<br>Timothy Leary's Home Page www.leary.com:8081<br>ToadHead Toad Head www.spies.com<br>Walter Cronkite Spit in My Food www.dnaco.net/~timh/walter.html<br></font></p>
