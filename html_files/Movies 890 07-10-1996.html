            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Tin Cup (M)<br>Kevin Costner, Rene Russo<br>Cheech Marin, Don Johnson<br>Directed by Ron Shelton<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>YOU don't have to play golf or even know very much about it to appreciate Kevin Costner's latest film, Tin Cup. Costner, as a loser, is on a winner in this one that lays to rest the disastrous ghost of Waterworld.<br>Director Ron Shelton, who co-wrote Tin Cup, was responsible for an earlier Costner classic, Bull Durham, and was also involved in White Men Don't Jump. So he knows how to make good films about sport and get the best out of his superstar.<br>Shelton manages to make golf a metaphor for life and to turn Costner into a very likable, relaxed loser with talent to burn, but no idea how to apply it to become a winner.<br>The idea that golf is a metaphor for life is well known by those who hack after the little white ball. The game seems to be God's reminder to those who believe they've grown up and have everything under control that nothing is predictable or even manageable.<br>In Tin Cup Costner plays Roy McAvoy, who as a teenager and young man showed awesome talent on the course. But now in his early 40s he's in a sort of bloke's paradise for the low achiever - a driving range in a little west Texas town that no one ever uses.<br>That is, except a group of mainly ratbag mates who spend their time drinking beer at the clubhouse and betting on which bug will get fried by the zapper first.<br>Chief among these mates is Romeo (Cheech Marin), who is Roy's caddy and campervan sharer as well as philosophical adviser.<br>Into their life walks the long legs of Rene Russo's delicious Dr Molly Griswold, a psychologist who wants to improve her woeful golf swing so she can have something in common with her world famous boyfriend, the pro-golfer David Simms (a nicely smarmy Don Johnson).<br>Simms is Roy's bete noir, the kid who he used to beat at golf, but who then harnessed a lesser talent to become a champion.<br>The first half of the long, but far from boring Tin Cup, is little concerned with golf, though, and heavily involved in Roy's desperate longing for Molly.<br>No attempt is made to explain why she should choose such a loser of a golf pro in such a faraway town. And none is needed. All we really want to care about is the unfolding love story ... the attraction of two quite opposite people.<br>Roy brings lovely hilarity to the situation of his aching heart when he decides to seek therapy and counselling on the matter . . . from, you guessed it, Molly, the only psychologist within a 200-km radius.<br>He decides the only way to woo Molly is to become a winner, and win big at the US Open. After all, he's got the talent if not the temperament.<br>There are genuinely funny scenes as he qualifies; breaking every club in his bag bar the seven iron to prove to caddy Romeo that he doesn't ever have to play safe to win.<br>This buccaneering style wins around Molly even before the Open and we are presented with what starts out a predictable, even cliched, climax to a sporting film. But it turns out anything but.<br>By the end of the film even avid golfers will be convinced that a seven-over is far better than a par hole any day when it is played with the adventure and derring-do that Roy McAvoy brings.<br>Tin Cup is a fine romantic comedy, quirky and charming and brimming with life breathed in by the relaxed, affable and athletic Costner.<br>Russo's Molly starts off a bit starchy, as she is meant to, but is full of little surprises.<br>And Cheech (of the old comedy team Cheech and Chong) is full of homespun wisdom and humour.<br></font></p>
