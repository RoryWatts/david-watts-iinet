            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA COMPANIES are using the Internet as a business tool in widely different ways.<br>Most computer firms, whether they specialise in software, hardware or both, have had a presence on the World Wide Web for some time. Downloading software is still a major business transaction on the Web.<br>But recently firms with interests as varied as selling cars, weddings, wildflowers and stuffed bears have been learning HTML and going where they once feared to tread.<br>Prosser Toyota, the State's oldest Toyota dealership, has gone beyond the normal Web presence of a site and offers a catalogue that can be downloaded to live on a user's hard drive.<br>?The forte of the Internet is information delivery, and in keeping with the expectations of a diverse viewer population we have delivered a very graphic, information-rich site,? Prosser Toyota director Clive Prosser says.<br>?This might, at first, seem like standard Internet fare, however, what makes our site unique is a range of downloadable electronic products.?<br>Prosser offers Windows wallpaper background showing the Toyota range, screensavers and an electronic catalogue of new and used cars.<br>The catalogue contains more than 56MB of compressed information that uses less than 3MB when downloaded and executed on a hard drive.<br>Mr Prosser says the Web site and electronic catalogue have attracted inquiries from the US, Britain, and even Japan, the home of Toyota.<br>URL: http://eagle.ois.com.au/prosser-toyota<br>JAPAN is also in the sites of a vastly different WA company.<br>Australian Dream Weddings of Nedlands virtually forgets its Australian origins at its Web site.<br>Each of Australian Dream Weddings' pages is almost entirely in Japanese, designed to attract Japanese here to be wed in glamorous style.<br>Each page contains a GIF image of a moment from a ?dream? wedding - Rolls-Royce pulling up outside a luxury hotel to collect the bride, for example - with accompanying text in Japanese.<br>It is a simple, clever idea which amounts to nothing more than billboards in cyberspace, but neatly done to attract the prospective overseas clientele.<br>URL: http://www.wantree.com.au/~tjv/jap.html<br></font></p>
