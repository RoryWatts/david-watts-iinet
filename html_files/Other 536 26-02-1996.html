            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">OPPOSITION Leader John Howard's planned part sale of Telstra and the prospect of Alexander Downer as foreign affairs minister are the biggest talking points on Internet newsgroups ... or electronic bulletin boards.<br>The most talkative newsgroup in the election campaign is aus.politics which receives more than 100 fresh postings a day on a wide variety of topics.<br>Until a week ago, the newsgroup had been dominated by a coterie of perhaps 10 people - all men - who appeared to favour conservative thinking. But in the past week, there has been a wider spread of views with more input from Labor supporters.<br>The discussion on Mr Howard's plan to spend $1 billion on the environment by selling a third of Telstra is the biggest issue, by a considerable margin. More than 100 postings have been made on the subject in the past fortnight.<br>The initial thread of the subject was that Mr Howard would have to blackmail Green and Democrat senators to get Telstra sell-off legislation through, otherwise he would have to explain ?why I won't save the environment?.<br>In a series of e-mail jousts, which have gone on for more than a week, correspondents wrote: ?I am worried about the whole picture coming together. I see Howard promising to run a deficit to make good on middle-class welfare but no promise to make good on the environment if the Senate crossbenches don't support Telstra privatisation!?<br>Response: ?Why's that? Because you believe more in Telstra than the environment, obviously.?<br>Counter: ?As to linkage, probably just to test whether the loud protestation of the Femocrats and the Greens - re their concern for the environment - really amount to anything, other than hot air.?<br>Counter to the counter: ?Howard must have thought it was a lot more than hot air - in fact their only concern - to have thought the Telstra funding linkage would work. He has had a rude shock - they are not single-issue parties who will trade anything for the environment.?<br>The last punch noted in aus.politics in this discussion: ?I guess time will tell. And since when did action have anything to do with right? Labor's already selling Telstra and you've just rolled over and whispered sweet nothings.?<br>The Downer as foreign affairs minister topic began with a self-confessed Liberal supporter expressing concerns about the possibility.<br>Other correspondents agreed, fearing a repetition of Mr Downer's infamous ?things that batter? statement at an international forum.<br>These fears gave way to well-founded speculation that Mr Downer was only shadow foreign affairs minister as a consolation for losing the party leadership and the portfolio would be filled by someone like Senate Opposition Leader Robert Hill, if the coalition won.<br>After about 50 postings, the subject changed to a tipping competition on the result of the election - about 50-50 Labor-Liberal.<br>Then it deteriorated into a slanging match between two correspondents, one Labor and the other Liberal.<br>The Liberal wrote in response to the Labor follower's endorsement of Mr Keating: ?And who does a yobbo welfare reject like yourself vote for? I'm so tired of people like you. If I were Prime Minister I'd make it law for inferior, ill-educated cretins like you to be gas-chambered.?<br>The Labor man's response: ?Crushed and humiliated. (This is getting tedious). Defeat brings out the worst in all of us. I told you (Liberal's name), stay away from threads (newsgroup subjects) which you do not have the intellectual capacity to deal with and you won't be laughed out of town.?<br></font></p>
