            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WORLD Wide Web browsers are old hat and boring, according to US Internet company cnet.<br>The company's judges declare that both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer are ?solid products and they're both boring. The really interesting browsing products are the add-ons for the existing browsers, and the future products that both Netscape and Microsoft are working. on.?<br>Instead of judging the two-horse browser race, cnet - which presides over a growing empire of sites like search.com, download.com and news.com - has given RealVideo the gong for best browser or add-on.<br>RealVideo allows Web surfers to watch videos in real time ... sort of. For the majority with 28.8K modems the quality is fuzzy and jumpy, more like a stop-gap animation.<br>However, RealVideo's enormous promise lies with increased bandwidth. And it does save a great deal of time compared with downloading small video clips.<br>The technology that excites the judges is ?push? associated with programs like PointCast News which can gather and deliver news to desktops automatically.<br>PointCast chairman Chris Hassett, is cnet's Person of the Year, a victory the judges admit will surprise many.<br>?The uninitiated can be forgiven, though. A search in HotBot for the low-profile chairman and CEO of what could arguably be called one of the hottest companies of the year turns up only 98 results,? says the company.<br>?But utter the word PointCast and faces light up with recognition. People have not only heard of it, but over 1.5 million have also signed up to use the PointCast SmartScreen software and information service, the PointCast Network, since its launch in February.?<br>cnet says Mr Hassett's vision of broadcasting as a way to deliver information made a similar impact in 1996.<br>Other awards:<br>Best Web authoring tool: WebFusion, which at 13Mb and $US500 the judges admit could be a shock. But it beat Microsoft FrontPage and the small but delightful to use Homesite because ?for the design-minded, the desktop-publishing-style authoring interface is friendlier and somewhat more intuitive?.<br>Best Java application: Visual Cafe Pro by Symantec which the judges said allowed programmers to build interfaces with a familiar forms-based drag and drop editor, making it a tool ?that just might throw the Java floodgates wide open?.<br>Best server software: Netscape Enterprise 3.0.<br>Best Net hardware: Sun's JavaStation.<br>Best on-line game: Quake, which defeated Diablo and Meridian59.<br>Best Net application: Marimba's Castanet which beat Corel Office for Java and the evergreen Eudora Pro in its latest version 3.0.<br></font></p>
