            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HAVE you had enough footy yet? Channel 7 showed six matches and a highlights package of a seventh game from Friday night to Sunday evening.<br>The quality of yet another topsy-turvy round with several heart-attack finishes has just whet the appetite for more.<br>But what if you are not an AFL fan? What is on the box for you?<br>Not a lot, sad to say. One of the most significant Australian sporting feats of the past week has been seen only in very short grabs on news and Channel 10's Sports Tonight.<br>Australia's young swimming team dominated the world short course championships in Gothenburg, Sweden. The team won nine gold medals, two silver and eight bronze.<br>The Margaret River Masters surf classic won by Yallingup's Taj Burrow also made only a small splash on the small screen.<br>Footage of the 18-year-old's brilliant 360 degree manoeuvre made the news, thankfully. The nearest TV got to comprehensive coverage of anything in the water was Channel 9's solid effort with the national surf lifesaving championships from Kurrawa, near Surfers Paradise.<br>Nine's coverage was a far cry from the days when the ABC, with Norman May at the helm, used to cover this event. Then the camera appeared fixed well up the beach. Any race in the surf consisted of little heads and arms poking about, seemingly kilometres away.<br>Now, with Nine, we even have a cameraman treading water at the turning buoys to capture swimmers, board riders and wave ski paddlers.<br>Once on Sunday, the camera gurgled under water showing a somewhat murky view of the swim leg of the ironmen.<br>The ubiquitous Whitman's airship showed another perspective, giving callers Darrel Eastlake, Nicole Stevenson and Mark Reaburn a chance to work out who was who.<br>Eastlake, an acquired taste with his penchant for shouting, added excitement to already exciting events. During the women's surfboat race Reaburn was explaining some of the intricacies of the exacting event when Eastlake bellowed: ?A wave, a wave, a wave.?<br>It was actually good timing. The burly one, so expert at catching the croppers in rugby league and motor racing, correctly identified a spectacular capsize in the making.<br>Good if you like surf, but what about Perth Glory fans? The 3-1 loss to the Melbourne Knights was another sport shown only briefly on TV news. Wider coverage of the match can be expected on Seven's Glory Days and SBS; but it is all too late for the lads on the hill.<br>???<br>SPORTS Tonight provides an invaluable service, but it doesn't always do it that well.<br>Last week, host Tim Webster gave a big build-up to the showdown between Adelaide and Port Adelaide, saying it was going to be fantastic (it was, too). He then crossed for more details from a reporter in Adelaide.<br>The reporter said it was going to be fantastic (heard that before) and the game would be played ?here? (waving in the direction of a dark and empty Football Park) on Saturday (it was Sunday, of course). He did not say much more, thankfully.<br></font></p>
