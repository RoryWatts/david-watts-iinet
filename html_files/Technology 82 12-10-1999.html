            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT boss Bill Gates is said to make so much money per second it would not be worth his time to bend over and pick up $500 if it was lying on the footpath.<br>By comparison, fellow American Marc Ewing makes a pittance. He was worth only about $1.5 billion last week.<br>Both men run software companies. Mr Gates's Microsoft dominates the world with an estimated 90 per cent of computers using some form of Windows as their operating system.<br>Mr Ewing's Red Hat Linux has considerably less than one per cent of desktops, according to the Stat Market data analysis site. However, Red Hat and other flavours of Linux are again dominating the hearts and minds of diehard computer users.<br>Late last year, Linux grabbed headlines when what became known as the Halloween Documents were circulated widely on the Net.<br>These were copies of a leaked memo written by a Microsoft engineer explaining the threat posed by a free Linux.<br>In the early parts of the year, headlines about the coming rise of Linux as the OS of the future abounded.<br>?Next stop, the desktop?? asked Infoworld in January. ?Next Bill Gates?? pondered USA Today the same month. ?Red Hat could beat Microsoft at its own game,? trumpeted Computer Reseller News in March.<br>Then ... not a lot.<br>The world went on as before with steady sales of Windows 98, so popular that it accounts for nearly 54 per cent of systems used by visitors to Stat Market. All flavours of Linux make up less than 0.3 per cent.<br>But the advocates of free-source software and cooperatively-developed operating systems made possible by Linux are starting to see the pendulum of publicity swing their way again.<br>First, Mr Ewing's Red Hat went public in August with spectacular success. Late last month, its market capitalisation was about $10 billion.<br>And in an interview with Salon Magazine last week, Mr Ewing made it clear that he believed Linux was now a genuine threat to Microsoft. ?Early on we didn't want to talk about being a competitor for fear of raising the ire of Microsoft and having them come after us,? he said. ?But all along we really were competing with them, and at this point, Microsoft has taken notice of Linux. We can't avoid it.?<br>A ND boy, hasn't the Seattle software giant taken notice. It has posted a Web page called Linux Myths at its Windows NT Server site. It tries to poke holes in common Linux beliefs while pushing Windows NT 4.0 as a superior system.<br>Microsoft's summary says: ?The Linux operating system is not suitable for mainstream usage by business or home users ... Linux clearly has a long way to go to be competitive with Windows NT 4.0.?<br>The myths page did not impress Linux advocates, who have hit back with a point-by-point rejoinder in Linux Weekly News.<br>The bottom line? ?Given the pace of development in the Linux world, Microsoft's document will be obsolete very soon.?<br>They sound like fighting words.<br>HELP DESK<br>Stat Market: www.statmarket.com<br>Microsoft's Linux Myths: www.microsoft.com/<br>ntserver/nts/news/msnw/LinuxMyths.<br>asp Linux Weekly News rebuttal: lwn.net/1999/<br>features/MSResponse.phtml<br>Salon interview with Marc Ewing:<br>www.salon.com/tech/view/1999/10/04/marc-ewing/<br>index.html<br></font></p>
