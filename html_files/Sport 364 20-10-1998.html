            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DID you see Mark Taylor's 334 not out; the most significant innings by an Australian batsman in 68 years?<br>Almost certainly not - unless you were one of the minority with pay-TV's Fox Sports.<br>And did you see live coverage of the spirited Irish knocking our professional footballers off their pedestals in front of 35,000 in Dublin late on Sunday in the enchanting mixture of Gaelic and Australian rules?<br>No, not unless you were in the east.<br>The majority of WA sport lovers have again been consigned to second-class status.<br>Yes, Nine gave us the controversial Caulfield Cup; Ten was in the Indycars pits and the ABC brought us the excitement of the Glory from Perth Oval in full.<br>But overall the armchair enthusiast was treated shabbily.<br>Nine does not like showing cricket from anywhere but Australia and England. Thus it gives us highlights ... usually around 1am.<br>On Friday, when Taylor broke records as easily as he broke the hearts of Pakistani bowlers, Nine showed no sensitivity for cricket history.<br>It stuck to its schedule of showing the deciding rugby league Test between Australia and New Zealand from Auckland in full before going to the highlights of a Test which also signalled the coming of age of WA's Justin Langer with a lovely 116; not to mention a near-perfect little innings of 76 not out by Ricky Ponting.<br>Why doesn't the channel have the flexibility to rearrange its programs? Surely Taylor's historic knock has to be seen as more earth-shattering than even a good rugby league Test (and it was not too bad).<br>Surely the channel which markets itself as the cricket lover's constant companion during summer could do more to show one of the great moments in the sport at a reasonable hour.<br>Consigning the highlights to the witching hour made the Test seem about as important to Nine as an American football or baseball game (and many of them get better time slots).<br>Seven showed the International Rules game at 11.45pm WA time, the same program slot as in Melbourne and Sydney.<br>Of course, 11.45 there is 9.45 here. The game started at 10pm WA time.<br>The Irish and Australians had hammered out their differences before Seven in Perth even got on the board.<br>Yet we were told it was live. For one of those two hours, Perth viewers had to sit through a very silly British show called Hospital.<br>And we thought Seven cared about its football followers, even when we are watching a delightfully fast and thrilling hybrid version of the game.<br>Seven here might like to take note of interest in the game as summed up by these comments from correspondents to an Australian football discussion group on the Internet: ?Great game, looking forward to next week?; ?Well, I enjoyed that?, ?A terrific game all round. Despite lot of negativity here in Australia, there's definitely a place for it in the future?, ?There's no doubt the game of International Rules has been the winner?.<br></font></p>
