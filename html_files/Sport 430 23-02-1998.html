            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GOOD grief, is that the time already?<br>On Saturday, I could have sworn that I had sweated through an hour of teeball under the harsh WA sun and the monotonous cloudless sky.<br>I could have sworn there were weeks of cricket and golf to go.<br>But no; right there on Channel 7 was footy from a wintry Hobart. Ten thousand Taswegians in jumpers, beanies and scarves, went mad as the first blood was shed and the first knee wrenched in the Ansett Cup.<br>Dare it be said - it's on again. Cape Town last night, Adelaide tonight, Subiaco on Wednesday and Adelaide again on Friday. And that's just the start. The real season begins late next month.<br>But the evidence suggests from just one game - North Melbourne's 45-point disposal of an experimental Carlton - that little has changed.<br>? North's Wayne Carey still has immunity from the holding-the-ball rule.<br>?Carlton president John Elliott still won't admit that the club has looked for an alternative to veteran coach David Parkin.<br>?Seven's Drew Morphett - and most of the other commentators - still believe that big, ugly Mick Martyn, the Roos full back, is a cult figure and beloved by the crowds.<br>?All commentators still advise a player running into an open goal to ?kick a goal, son?.<br>?When play deteriorates into fumbles and mistakes, commentators still resort to trivia, like what sort of shorts the players are wearing this year. (Actually this can be fascinating stuff. On Saturday it was prompted by a Winston Abraham goal, kicked when the new Roo just about had his shorts dragged to his ankles).<br>?And it is all marvellous, heartily welcomed back to a screen that was bedevilled at the weekend by a one-sided, one-day cricket semi-final in front of hardly anybody at the SCG, and the second successive one-sided golf tournament. Oh, and there was a bit of slipping and sliding from Nagano at the Winter Olympics.<br>Seven has had far too much of emotional ice dancers showing their knickers, Bruce McAvaney teaching his co-commentator English, and bobsledding, which is just billy-cart derbies taken to icy extremes.<br>However, Zali Steggall's bronze slalom medal was terrific. All channels benefited enormously from the idiosyncrasies at Nagano that meant the medal was not presented until 24 hours after the event.<br>This meant they were able to fill two nights of sports news with the one triumph - one that put us level on the medal table with the far more wintry nation of Britain.<br>There was not much else about at the time. Fortunately, the appearance of such a rash of footy will restore much-needed fodder to TV bulletins.<br>Who can wait for news of hammies, knees, groins, training non-appearances, nightclub disturbances, coaching careers on a knife-edge, tribunal hearings, etc etc?<br>And what will happen in the Roo Boy ads starring nerdy Ewin McCormack? The foretaste on Saturday suggests they will be more entertaining than that soppy Nescafe Gold couple.<br></font></p>
