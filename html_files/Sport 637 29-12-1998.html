            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WA FAST bowler Matthew Nicholson has hardly had a fairytale Test debut at the MCG, but on Sunday he did provide one of the better TV moments of the year.<br>He had charged halfway down the wicket, pumping his fist almost before Ian Healy had completed catching Nassar Hussein to give Nicholson his first Test wicket.<br>The leap of joy and big grin were infectious.<br>TV-bound sport lovers have had a memorable 1998, with Nicholson's happiness just one small part of it.<br>Try some of these for size:<br>Cricket: Mark Taylor's 334 not out in Pakistan ... only trouble was you had to have Foxtel to appreciate it fully.<br>Justin Langer's first Test century ... ditto on Foxtel, but how about his second one, 179 not out, that set up Australia's Ashes win in Adelaide?<br>Tennis: Patrick Rafter sweeping aside Mark Philippoussis for his second successive US Open win.<br>Jana Novotona's tears of relief at conquering Wimbledon at last.<br>Lleyton Hewitt's boyish, bouncing arrival on the scene at 16.<br>Golf: Greg Chalmers and Stuart Appleby fighting it out at the Australian Open with WA's Chalmers prevailing by one shot.<br>Any of the play from the Presidents Cup, but particularly Craig Parry's tigerish rounds.<br>Swimming: Almost too many to mention thanks to the dominance at the Commonwealth Games.<br>But try Susie O'Neill's uncharacteristic elation and victory lap at Kuala Lumpur, Michael Klim's seven medals at the world titles in Perth, the arrival of Ian Thorpe and the ascendancy of Grant Hackett.<br>Athletics: Matt Shervington might have come fourth in the 100m at Kuala Lumpur, but the youngster's speed was thrilling.<br>Back-up girls Nova Peris-Kneebone and Tania van Heer did not let the side down either.<br>Soccer: Without Perth Glory to drool over regularly, the TV moments had to belong to France's comprehensive win against Brazil in the World Cup.<br>Rugby union: Easy ... Australia whitewashing New Zealand 3-0 to take the Bledisloe Cup.<br>AFL: Darren Jarman's torpedo from 50m sliding off his boot in the dying minutes to give Fremantle a one-point win.<br>West Coast's comeback from being eight goals-to-nothing down to beat the Bulldogs at the WACA Ground.<br>The crowd's reception for Muhammad Ali at the grand final.<br>There were plenty of ordinary moments, too. None was worse than watching Mark Waugh and Shane Warne admitting they had been naive and stupid to accept money from bookmakers for information.<br>Either that, or any time John Russo rabbited on about the holding the ball rule and ?no prior opportunity? during the AFL season.<br></font></p>
