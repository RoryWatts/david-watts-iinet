            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT is fighting escalating battles with users.<br>On one front the software giant is battling people who want nothing to do with its products. On the other it faces people who want more Microsoft software - but are not prepared to pay for it.<br>More than 100 anti-Windows protesters marched on Microsoft's Silicon Valley office in California last week demanding refunds for software installed on their computers at purchase.<br>The protesters said they wanted their computers to run non-Microsoft operating systems, principally Linux, and demanded refunds for the cost of Windows 95 or 98 - present on nearly all new PCs - that they did not need.<br>The campaign for refunds is gathering momentum on the Web. Advocates from the Linux Mall group have set up the Windows Refund Centre Home Page which offers step-by-step advice to users who do not want Windows on a newly-bought PC, but believe they have been charged a so-called ?Microsoft tax? because the OS is installed.<br>The site tells users to insert a bootable floppy disk for their alternative operating system before turning their new PC on. Then the computer will operate with the desired OS and no agreements are made with Microsoft.<br>The site's authors say that refunds are only an issue because many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) refuse to sell a machine without Microsoft's OS on it.<br>?Some say that their agreements with Microsoft require them to pay Microsoft for an OS for that machine, and include one as well,? says Linux Mall. ?Some OEMs even go so far as to say that they may not pre-load any non-Microsoft OS. We feel this is monopolistic, strong-arm, and restrictive of consumer choice.?<br>The surge in interest in the free OS, Linux and the development of more user-friendly versions like Red Hat, have caused some computer manufacturers such as Dell and IBM to promise new PCs loaded with Linux so that users have a choice.<br>Linux Mall claims that many Web sites - most of which are devoted to open-source programming - are working together on the refund project.<br>Sites mentioned include Zork, Slashdot, Niestu, Linuxmafia, Netcraft, Deirdre, Electric Lichen, and Netscape's Open Directory project at dmoz.org.<br>Microsoft is even fighting users who don't want to pay for its products.<br>A Web site called Betanews which carries news of software developments and tells users how to obtain copies for beta testing, spread the word this month that people could obtain at least $1000 worth of MS software for nothing.<br>An e-mail published at the site described a survey that Microsoft had designed to evaluate consumer interests, and possibly use for Office 2000 distribution.<br>The survey could be entered if a user was lucky enough to be selected by Microsoft after submitting an e-mail to a special address.<br>The survey took about three hours to complete and created a response file which went back to Microsoft by e-mail, earning the user free programs such as Front Page 98 or the Monster Truck Madness game, along with Office 2000.<br>However, people who try to follow the instructions from the Betanews site now get this e-mail response from Microsoft:<br>?Thank you very much for your interest in the MS Office Users Survey. Unfortunately, due to changes necessitated by recent unintended publicity about the survey, we are accepting new respondents on an invitation basis only.?<br>Windows Refunds:<br>linuxmall.com/refund/<br>Betanews:<br>www.betanews.com<br></font></p>
