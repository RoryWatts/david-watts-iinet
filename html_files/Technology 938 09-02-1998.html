            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH people can now surf the Net to find the best way to get anywhere in the city on public transport.<br>Dr Chris Whitaker, director-general of the Department of Transport, said the timetable initiative was just the beginning of much more computerised information.<br>The department has made available an interactive bus, ferry and train journey planner and says commuters, tourists and day-trippers can now key in the addresses of departure and arrival points and be shown five different ways to make the journey on public transport.<br>They can find out how long the journey will take and even how far they must walk to a bus stop or other connection.<br>The move makes Perth the only Australian city with an interactive journey planner on the World Wide Web of the Internet.<br>Before the launch of the website, people wanting timetable information mostly relied on printed versions or the Serco telephone information facility.<br>The service employs a battery of 30 phone operators distributing information to callers from a computerised database in the busport in Mounts Bay Road.<br>Transperth spent $60,000 modifying the database and placed it on the Internet for anyone to view for the price of a local phone call.<br>?We're also developing the ability for Internet users to pay for their vehicle registration on-line and even design their own number plates,? Dr Whitaker said.<br>?We're looking at developing a site which will provide information like tidal movements and where surfers can find the best waves,? he said.<br>Transperth plans to set up screens in big shops and other busy locations as part of a drive to attract more people to public transport.<br>Sydney does not have an interactive journey planner like Perth's though it does offer electronic versions of train and ferry timetables.<br>Planners similar to Transperth's have been used in Britain for the past 13 months by both British Rail and the London Underground.<br>But neither produces results that bring together all forms of public transport.<br>The journey planner is on: www.transperth.wa.gov.au<br></font></p>
