            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Here follows what should have been a tale of woe. Any super-sensitive computer users should avert their eyes at certain stages. Kiddies should not try this on their family PC.<br>It all happened in a leafy Perth suburb during last week's heatwave. A PC user - let's call him David, for that is his real name - had been a happy little sausage since Christmas Eve.<br>He had a nice new 2.1Gb hard drive and what's more was testing the beta version of Windows 98.Microsoft's new operating system shell, due for release later this year, US Department of Justice willing, was humming in perfect harmony with his Pentium 133 and 32Mb of RAM.On the surface, Win98 looked little different to Windows 95; perhaps more colourful and flashy with icons and folders but basically evolutionary rather than revolutionary.<br>David had installed 98 over a version of 95 enhanced by Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. Thus the old system had the Web interface that MS has been at pains to flog to the world.<br>A crucial point in the Justice Department v Microsoft court battle is that the Seattle software giant claims its Internet Explorer browser is a fundamental part of its new operating shell, ie, Win98. MS says you can't have 98 without Explorer.The Justice Department says leave the browser out and let users decide whether they want it or Netscape.<br>David decided to test this. He needed to uninstall 98 and then uninstall Explorer from 95, so he could install 98 again and see whether it actually added the Web enhancements that would now be missing.Win98 uninstalled quickly and painlessly. MSIE 4.0, on the Win95 system that now existed, would not go without persistent questioning such as this:About to uninstall Internet Explorer, are you sure?; thenn Are you absolutely certain?;Do you know what you're doing?That may be a little exaggeration but MSIE 4.0 was not going to be got rid of without a good fight.David dispensed with it and, as he answered Yes for the last time, he broke into a cold sweat. He was in a hot sweat already because it was 40C but the cold sweat signified calamity.<br>He had not backed up his e-mail or address book from MS Outlook Mail and News, and he had not backed up his Favorites - Netscape calls them bookmarks.<br>The prospect, on a hot day that was getting more heated, was that he had lost 60 pieces of mail, an address book with more than 40 contacts and more than 100 URLs in his Favorites folders, many of them for work, more than a few for pleasure.How could he hope to find them all again, particularly as at least half had been arrived at by random surfing?Before reinstalling 98, David tried out the now unenhanced 95. Very few things worked. Warning messages said repeatedly that vital .dll (dynamic link library) files were missing. Few programs would run, he could not use dial-up networking to access the Net, and everything was as slow as a walk through knee-deep treacle.<br>With a sweaty sigh (it was now 50C in his head and -10C in the pit of his stomach; sure symptoms of a disk re-format), he reinstalled 98.It eventually went swimmingly, and, as David suspected, stuck Internet Explorer, the Active Desktop and Channels right back on the system.And there were the old favorites, every one. But no Outlook.<br>Still, the point seemed to be proved - Windows 98 is built for Internet Explorer (it took one minute to get the PC working like a browser) and taking MSIE 4.0 out of Win95 renders it fairly useless.Of course, much of that pain would have been averted by backing up .dlls, so they could be copied back to the system when it announced they were missing.<br>The whole messy exercise also showed how far Internet Explorer penetrates the operating system. The mail and addresses are still on the system. Favorites looked as if they had never had any intention of leaving when MSIE 4.0 left.Who knows how many other files were left behind and how many, crucial to other operations, were taken away?<br>In one breath it is both annoying and pleasing. Annoying that a browser should envelope a system so completely. Pleasing that a browser can work in such harmony and provide fail-safes for block-headed tamperers who know just enough to get in trouble.<br></font></p>
