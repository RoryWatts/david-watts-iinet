            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE growing commercialisation of the Internet is reflected in the latest version of the Netscape Communicator browser suite.<br>The most noticeable enhancement in version 4.7 of the browser that made the Web such a popular medium is the addition of a Shop button that takes users to the Netcentre Shop@Netscape portal site.<br>The file download feature is also accompanied by a window appearing to offer advertising space.<br>Increasing demand for music seems behind the inclusion of the Winamp MP3 player in the full 18Mb download of Communicator.<br>Although there are several more subtle inclusions in 4.7, many users seem upset by the commercial aspects of the new release.<br>They blame Netscape's new owners, America Online, saying the company seems intent on helping to kill off Net culture.<br>Among comments at a Ziff Davis Publishing Web forum last Friday were these from software developers, a computer engineer and an IT manager: ?Why don't they try something useful ... giving as much support for HTML4 and Cascading Style Sheets as Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 would be the best place to start.?<br>?Just what I need, an easier way for the users here to waste their time shopping during work and burning up bandwidth on our network playing music.?<br>?This is a joke. Once again, AOL comes along and rapes something great for all it's worth to push the commercialisation of the Web and the death of Internet culture. Here we are wanting a browser capable of competing with IE's compatibility, and instead AOL shoves more ads, commercials and ways to try to spend money online.?<br>?Netscape/AOL needs to quit worrying about all the "cute' features that IE offers, and return to the path that gave them the market share in the first place, a stable, reliable, predictable browser.?<br>Comments such as these do not augur well for Netscape which is starting to consistently lose market share to Internet Explorer after once enjoying the support of more than 80 per cent of users.<br>Latest browser war figures from Stat Market give IE 75 per cent share compared with Netscape's 23 per cent. IE use is split almost equally between version 4 and version 5, both of which are standard inclusions with either Windows 95 or 98 operating systems.<br>A smaller sample of users at the Browserwatch survey site gives IE 51 per cent and Netscape 36 per cent.<br>The Shop button emphasises AOL's stated intention earlier this year to expand its commerce plan across brands. The Netcentre Shop provides links to merchants, news and specials, and themed merchandising.<br>New keyword technology also allows users to type ?Shop? along with a category name like shoes into the URL locator, and be taken directly to that section of the Shop site.<br>AOL backed the Shop button last week when it told Ziff Davis's ZDNet that the number of AOL members who have shopped online had risen from 5.5 million in June last year to 11 million in August this year.<br>PC Magazine in the United States preferred to concentrate on Netscape's new audio and multimedia features when assessing 4.7 last week. ?The changes in this latest browser upgrade are savvy, adding radio, shopping, better instant messaging, WinAmp and Flash 4,? a review said. ?If you want integrated tools in your browser that will deliver the richness of the Web in all its glory, upgrade.?<br>A less optimistic note was sounded by Strouds CWSApps site, a repository of popular PC software. It warned: ?Netscape Communicator is still used by roughly 35 per cent of the Internet market, but it continues to lose ground each day to the faster and more functional Internet Explorer. Unless Netscape 5.x appears soon, and unless the new release offers noticeable advantages over Internet Explorer 5, Netscape could see its market share erode even further.?<br>HELP DESK<br>Netscape Communicator 4.7 file size: 18.1Mb<br>Download time at 28.8kbps: about 1 hour 25min.<br>Netscape: home.netscape.com or www.netscape.com.au<br>ZDNet: www.zdnet.com<br>Stroud's CWSApps: cwsapps.tower.com.au<br></font></p>
