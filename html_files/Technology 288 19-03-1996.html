            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A SMALL Perth software company has hit the Net with programs aimed at easing the mess and confusion hyper text can often cause to a user.<br>Specialising in data capture, GME Systems say they are building easy-to-use software that will help manage data bases, particularly in WA's booming resource industries where paper-based systems sit alongside digital systems.<br>GME, with a freeware program called Remove-It, has also stumbled into a domestic market, where users afraid of or confused by HTML, will benefit.<br>Remove-It allows users to get rid of HTML coding on documents downloaded from the World Wide Web on to their hard disks.<br>Instead of being confronted with what can be a bewildering array of marks akin to hieroglyphics on printouts of Web documents, users can strip them and save the Web document as a clean file in whatever word-processing format they desire.<br>Straight printouts of Web documents have certain style, of course. But when users simply want the words, or want to present documents in their own way, Remove-It can save the drudgery of manually deleting HTML tags.<br>GME also has developed its own HTML editor called Swag-Man which will allow users to compile their own Web pages easily.<br>Swag-Man has full previewing abilities and a graphic interface for ease of use. Unlike Remove-It, it costs money (maximum of $75), but is available in different options for different budgets.<br>The top option allows upgrades to Windows 95 versions when available and the lowest option at $30 is minus the previewing abilities.<br>URL: http://www.iinet.<br>net.au/ bwh/<br>???<br>SEARCH engines Alta Vista, Lycos and Yahoo are as vital to the Internet as a keyboard and mouse.<br>But you have to hunt for them, usually pointing, clicking and waiting for them to appear ... and waiting if it is a bad day on the backbone.<br>But US company Architext has invented Excite, a search engine that users can put straight on their home page.<br>Excite is not as fast or as comprehensive as Alta Vista, but it is there, ready to use at any time.<br>Installation is undramatic. Two weeks ago it was a simple matter of copying HTML codes off Excite's Web site and pasting them into your own page.<br>From there .. just search.<br>URL: http://www.<br>excite.com/navigate/<br></font></p>
