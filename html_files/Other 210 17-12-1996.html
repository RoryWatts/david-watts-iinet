            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">'TIS the season to be jolly. But more important, 'tis the season to be holy.<br>Christmas is Christianity's second most important religious festival after Easter, and it is well represented on the World Wide Web.<br>The commercial arms of the Web are as chock-a-block with gift advice, consumer greed and even pudding recipes as the real world.<br>But religion is certainly not neglected.<br>The popular index Point.com has chosen what it says are 10 excellent sources of religious philosophy for those who believe this time of the year needs contemplation and thought rather than just credit cards and hangovers.<br>Point's top 10 covers all major faiths, as well as purely philosophical ones.<br>In an introduction to its top 10, Point says: ?After surfing through the Web's rich supply of religious resources, one comes away impressed not by the differences and friction between religions, but by their openness and their similarities.?<br>Sites chosen include: Andy Wood's Centre for Utopian/Dystopian Studies, St John's University Hill Monastic Manuscript Library, CyberMuslim Information Collective and the Institute for Christian Leadership Issues.<br>Very close to home, Tim Atkinson, pastor of the Roleystone Community Church in WA, has maintained an excellent home page for at least a year now incorporating a variety of religious, as well as more homely, links.<br>If Christmas has an anthem, it is probably Silent Night. Now surfers can check out the words in dozens of the 230 languages the song has been translated into.<br>The Silent Night site has been set up by a South African and has a variety of Christmas and religious links.<br></font></p>
