            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Former arch-enemies Apple and Microsoft are now the best of friends after a landmark deal last week. Bill Gates comes out a winner, of course, but what about Apple?<br>The Net is groaning under the weight of news, analysis, opinion and emotional outbursts about last week's Microsoft-Apple deal.<br>This mountain of information - and some disinformation - makes one point very clear: MS's purchase of about $200 million worth of non-voting Apple stock for three years is not the end of the world. Indeed it keeps the struggling Californian company viable and may inject badly needed consumer confidence.<br>A respected computer industry research firm has cautioned enterprises to avoid panic over the Microsoft investment but has recommended that Macs not be deployed outside of traditional graphic arts areas.<br>Gartner Group analyst Michael Gartenberg wrote last week that ?the news from MacWorld is a positive and reasonable first step for Apple to take in its latest attempt to return to industry relevance?.<br>Gartner has given its stamp of approval to the new board noting that ?the new board of directors is meaningful in terms of symbolism and practical terms. Apple has made an aggressive move to elevate itself significantly in the marketplace?.<br>Among pluses cited by other analysts at Ziff Davis Publishing, cnet, Macworld, the Washington Post and London's Financial Times are these: Apple shareholders will have stability instead of continuing losses.The price went up 33 per cent within hours of the announcement of the deal in Boston by Apple founder Steve Jobs and MS chief Bill Gates.<br>Software developers now have a guaranteed secondary market.<br>Internet publishers will have a stable platform because MS and Apple have promised to make their Java programming tools and Java virtual machines compatible.<br>Apple employees now have better job security ? for at least three years.<br>Apple customers now have an assurance software will be developed for them and their beloved machines for the foreseeable future.<br>Microsoft preserves an important market. MS makes hundreds of millions from its Macintosh products.<br>There are generally agreed to be two major losers. Netscape has to contend with the fact that Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser is the default for new Wintel machines already. Now it becomes the standard for Macs.<br>Mac zealots, according to ZDNet, will feel they have been taken over by the Great Satan (Mr Gates), and that one day their Macs will boot up with the words ?Microsoft Windows for Macintosh?.<br>The deal is also being seen as politically astute. It keeps a rival alive and federal regulators away.<br>A senior industry commentator was quoted by Macworld as saying: ?If Apple goes down, then Windows becomes a monopoly. It's more efficient for Microsoft to keep Apple alive, because it avoids the anti-trust, it kicks Netscape, and comes out looking like the good guy.?<br>User forums on the Web and in newsgroups have produced some passionate comments, including these: ?The sky is falling and it's blue with little white clouds.?<br>?Just because Mr Bill decides to throw a few dollars at Apple, doesn't mean Mac zealots need to stop hating Microsoft products.?<br>?This is no gesture of goodwill. It is a carefully plotted and thinly veiled attempt to spread even further the smothering blanket of influence of Windoze over the computing world.?<br>HELP DESK<br>Financial Times: www.ft.com<br>Washington Post's Apple timeline: www.washingtonpost.com/<br>wp-srv/business/longterm/apple/<br>applechron.htm<br>Microsoft/Apple announcement: www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/<br>1997/Aug97/MSMACpr.htm<br>product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q4/970806.pr.rel. - The bottom line: www5.zdnet.com/zdnn/content/zdnn/<br>0806/zdnn0004.html<br>Macworld Daily: www.macworld.com/daily/<br>cnet Macworld Expo special: www.news.com/News/Item/<br>0,4,13189,00.html<br></font></p>
