            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WELCOME to the real world. They play soccer here.<br>On the surface it does not appear entirely fair, but life is not fair either. Australia and Iran finished square at three-all in their two World Cup qualifiers in Tehran and Melbourne. But Iran joins the other 31 finalists in France next year thanks to the weighting of away goals. They scored two, we scored one, making the overall aggregate 5-4.<br>Still, they are the conditions and Terry Venables' Socceroos, the 85,000 at the MCG and millions watching the drama on TV knew that.<br>Like the real world, soccer is not entirely just either.<br>Australia's new pin-up boy Harry Kewell challenged Iranian goalkeeper Ahmadreza Abedzadeh late in the game. Kewell backed off, turning away as Abedzadeh plucked the dangerously bouncing ball out of the air.<br>Then Abedzadeh lifted his leg into Kewell. Abedzadeh, not Kewell, went down in the type of incurable agony only soccer players are capable of doing. Kewell got a yellow card, naughty boy.<br>For what? The SBS replays and no doubt the giant screens at the MCG showed the 19-year-old Leeds striker had done nothing.<br>Saturday night's match showed just what was real international competition.<br>Forget Australia v New Zealand cricket from Hobart, even though the lowly Kiwis tried to make a game of the rain-ruined affair.<br>Forget past weeks on the rugby stage with the Wallabies whipping Scotland and bumbling to a draw against England.<br>Forget also the sight of the Rupert Murdoch-made Super League team giving Britain a serious hiding.<br>All these were and are Mickey Mouse stuff compared with World Cup soccer, the most watched sport on the planet.<br>For a start, the cricket and rugby internationals were played against like-minded countries. They speak English - even in Edinburgh - they share common heritages, they eat fish and chips (though in NZ they call them fush and chups).<br>The soccer against Iran was a different matter entirely. To appreciate that, you only had to see the first leg from Tehran a week ago when 120,000 to 130,000 Iranian men sat in deafening silence after Kewell scored Australia's goal.<br>And we Australians flatter ourselves that we are sports mad. Tosh. Just look at these paragraphs from the official Iranian newsagency IRNA, describing the country's delight at the two-all draw in Melbourne: ?Although several hours have passed from the victory of the Iranian national soccer team over the Australian stars, Iranians are still in the streets of different Iranian cities, townships and villages congratulating each other, waving national flags and strewing flowers, giving away sweets and cakes.<br>?In Tabriz, the sea of people rallied in front of Kharim Bagheri's residence, to express their gratitude and thank Bagheri's family for (his) having netted the first goal.?<br>Reuters reported that the crowds jamming Tehran in celebration were the biggest since the Shah fled the country in 1979.<br>That puts in the shade packs of Crows supporters roaming Melbourne streets singing the awful Pride of South Australia back in September doesn't it?<br></font></p>
