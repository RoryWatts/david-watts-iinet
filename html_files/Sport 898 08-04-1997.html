            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">OUT they go. The AFL's stars are being knocked off one by one as demands on their minds and bodies mount.<br>Wayne Carey, of North Melbourne, Gary Ablett, of Geelong, and Chris Mainwaring, of West Coast, are just three big names who will be out for between six weeks and the whole season while their knees are rebuilt.<br>Paul Roos, of Sydney, and Corey McKernan, of North, left the field in the first round with injuries that appear not to be as bad as first thought.<br>Nicky Winmar, of St Kilda, played up and was left out of the senior team that was thrashed by Brisbane at the weekend. And Greg Williams moaned and whinged almost too much. We will know his fate when the court injunction against his nine-week penalty ends in two months.<br>Meanwhile, West Coast's biggest name, Glen Jakovich, waits to return from a knee reconstruction, but captain John Worsfold still cools his heels before resuming after a similar operation.<br>With that sort of carnage the AFL should not be much of a competition. But it is.<br>Nail-biters like Fremantle's win over Hawthorn on Sunday, and the Western Bulldogs surprise win over Sydney on Saturday, helped make the second round as enthralling as the first.<br>Throw in blasts from losing coaches Malcolm Blight, of Adelaide, and Mick Malthouse, of West Coast, plus the stunning early form of Collingwood, and the recipe still is for a simmering pot of excitement and intrigue - big names or not.<br>A letter writer to The West Australian last week wondered aloud what Carey's absence would do to the commentating of Channel 7's Bruce McAvaney. The writer suggested McAvaney only thrived when Carey went near the ball.<br>It is true that everyone has their favourites - think of Dennis Cometti when Peter Matera enters the fray, or Neil Kerley when anyone from the Crows looks at the ball, but that is footy.<br>There will always be favourites. Listen to spectators at Subiaco during an Eagles match, for example, and Mr and Mrs Average will always proclaim their favourites. Matera might kick the goal, but a Drew Banfield fan will say it was his shepherding that paved the way.<br>Tony Evans might snap truly, but someone will put it down to Guy McKenna rebounding in the first place.<br>Commentators are, after all, ordinary people. They put their feet in their mouth like the majority of us.<br>What commentators seem to love is a clash or a crash no matter how sickening. The fault lies with the medium of television because it can show these incidents so graphically and repeatedly.<br>Thus, Ashley McIntosh's sickening head clash with Geelong's Brenton Sanderson got a lot of airplay.<br>Channel 10 had the Indycars from the Gold Coast all weekend and played Christian Fittipaldi's frightening crash at least six times on Sunday night. In a weekend of top football, Davis Cup quarter final dominance and excellent one-day cricket from South Africa, Fittipaldi's pyrotechnics somehow overshadowed everything else on Ten.<br>? Note to Anne Fulwood, of Seven. Australia played the Czech Republic in the Davis Cup tie, not Czechoslovakia, a country that has not existed since January 1, 1993.<br></font></p>
