            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">John Travolta: Back in Character<br>By Wensley Clarkson<br>Hodder Headline, $24.95<br>SCREEN icon John Travolta probably deserves more than the latest bit of pulp non-fiction written about him. So do his fans. Wensley Clarkson has packed his paperback with information so it could easily become a must for film buffs wanting a quick fix on Travolta.<br>But much in John Travolta: Back in Character has been said before, mostly in the many published interviews the blue-eyed wonder has given since he started transfixing the world back in the late 1970s.<br>As a biography it succeeds in the shallow sense that it gives the reader a lot of surface knowledge - date of birth, size of family, films made, love affairs, planes and houses owned and so forth.<br>That is all well and good for quiz nights but leaves the reader still groping for the all-important motivation and character behind a complex career.<br>Travolta set the film world on its ear with Saturday Night Fever in 1977 where, as battling Brooklyn boy Tony Manero, he danced his way into the hearts and minds of a generation.<br>Already adored by fans because of his character Vinnie Barbarino in the TV sitcom, Welcome Back Kotter, fame engulfed Travolta like a bushfire.<br>The youngest son of a closeknit New Jersey family, doted on by his drama teacher mother, he was only 23 and found it all bewildering.<br>Travolta suffered the well publicised tragedy of losing his lover, actress Diana Hyland, to cancer about the time Fever became big.<br>He sought refuge in the philosophies of the Church of Scientology to help him through hard times.<br>And those hard times multiplied after success turned sour and he became almost unemployable.<br>It is also well documented how Quentin Tarantino resurrected Travolta's career by making him heroin-addicted hitman Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction.<br>The restoration stunned the film world and bewitched audiences.<br>Travolta appears to be back in the groove, chewing the scenery like few actors in history.<br>But why, what makes him that special?<br>Readers of this book will be left wondering.<br></font></p>
