            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIANS enjoy some of the cheapest connection rates to the Internet in the world.<br>The British telecommunications regulator, Oftel, compared the cost of 20 hours online in 30 countries and Australia was ranked the seventh cheapest country in a table headed by Finland, Canada and Iceland.<br>The table showed that Australians - already among the heaviest users of the Net per head of population - had cheaper access than people in the US, New Zealand or Britain.<br>The Oftel report was aimed at showing the cost benefits of free Internet service providers, a trend that is increasing the number of British users by 10,000 a day.<br>Dozens of British ISPs are now offering free services. In exchange, they receive a percentage of the revenue that Net users generate on the British phone system where all calls are time-charged.<br>British users can sign up with ISPs at supermarket chains or electrical retailers who offer installation CD-ROMs on their shelves.<br>The Oftel table, available at its Web site, is based on ISP hourly charges from early last year plus the cost of phone calls. Increased competition has cut those charges since.<br>But the table says Australians paid $57.20 for 20 hours. This was considerably more than the $30.10 paid by the Finns, but better than $62.44 in the US, $72.44 in NZ and (pre free-ISP) $72.48 in Britain.<br>Oftel calculated that free ISP services cut British rates to $49.20 for 20 hours, taking the country from 14th to fourth on the affordability scale.<br>The dearest country was the Czech Republic where 20 hours cost more than $117.<br>The table also shows the percentage of connection costs made up by telephone charges.<br>Again, Australia is low on the scale with 31.2 per cent of online costs made up by phone calls.<br>This suggests reasonably high ISP charges, but these have fallen because of increased competition in the market since the Oftel survey.<br>The lowest calls-to-ISP fees percentage was in Mexico with 18.6 per cent. Hungary with a 21.6 per cent ratio, and Turkey at 26.6 were the only other countries below Australia.<br>In the US, phone charges contributed to exactly half the cost of going online. The top 10 most affordable countries on the table were: Finland, Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Australia, Sweden, Turkey and the US.<br>www.oftel.gov.uk<br></font></p>
