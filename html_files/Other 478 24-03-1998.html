            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Cartoonist Dean Alston summed it up neatly in The West Australian last Wednesday. He had Prime Minister John Howard, media magnate Kerry Packer and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates at a dinner table. Mr Howard to Mr Gates: ?I'm thinking of floating Australia . . . . are you interested?? Mr Gates: ?That'd be kinda neat . . . Microzoft.?<br>Mr Gates' two-day visit here featured the unprecedented spectacle of him addressing Federal Cabinet about his vision of the high-tech future and Australia's place in it.<br>We should all be wary of the Government feting Mr Gates so grandly. Granted, he is probably the world's most significant and successful businessman, and granted, he has a head full of visions that could empower people if introduced properly.<br>He is also facing close questioning, in the US and Europe, about his company's allegedly monopolistic behaviour. Most importantly, he has a mission to put Microsoft first in nearly all aspects of the technology revolution. One of the ways he wants to do this is to have Windows CE software powering all manner of goods from car dashboards to mobile phones. The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a Microsoft executive as saying ?Windows everywhere? to this.<br>Mr Gates also has a mission to spread the word of WebTV, a Microsoft product that sits on top of the TV and allows it to receive the Internet.It would be po-faced elitism to deny that this would be a wonderful breakthrough, perhaps giving thousands who cannot afford PCs, or feel intimidated by them, the chance to take part in the information-rich world of the Net.<br>But a great deal of thought and other opinions are needed. The risks of following the path of just one man - Mr Gates - should be obvious. It would be a Microsoft view of the world with a little help from some important friends.<br>Mr Gates cites as an example of his vision for Australia's future the joint venture between the Packer company, PBL, and Microsoft at the ninemsn site.<br>This showcases many of PBL's products: Channel 9 news, 60 Minutes, Wide World of Sports and Dolly magazine to name a few. It is also fairly laudatory of Mr Gates, with at least one headline referring to him as ?Bill?.<br>It works slowly unless you have a fast connection and is weighed down by too much techno-wizardry, until you discover a well-hidden button that allows more conventional Web surfing.<br>But as hardware and bandwidth improves, ninemsn will be a model site . . . in form. Its content, however, takes the surfer only a little further than their TV sets or newsstands.<br>One can see the benefits of grabbing pre-eminent slots of digital TV or WebTV with a site that will be able to offer interactive shopping, banking etc, provided you are prepared to live mainly in the jurisdiction of the ninemsn world.<br>The need is for more players in this game. More opinions from other technically-savvy people should also be put to Cabinet so it does not think Mr Gates has a mortgage on ideas.<br>As users can see from the reasonably free and almost anarchic nature of today's Net, there are many more versions of life than those offered by Mr Packer or Mr Gates.<br></font></p>
