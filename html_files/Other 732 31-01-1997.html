            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IN THE space of eight days I recently attended a 40th, a 50th and a 60th birthday party. It was not the same person ageing rapidly, I hasten to add.<br>What was most remarkable about all three events was how similar they were. This was despite the fact the 40th was a grand night-time occasion around a sparkling pool on a hot night, the 50th was a knockabout informal get-together in the backyard on the one day this month it was cold and rainy; and the 60th was a semi-formal sit-down lunch in the front yard on a gorgeous Australia Day.<br>No matter the age of the birthday boy and girls, they all attracted guests who could party, and did so into the wee hours.<br>Funny thing about age, it does not appear to get in the way of a good time, particularly when one of your mates adds a zero to their age. It is a time for rejoicing in the fact that it's better you than me, or now you know what it's like.<br>The only birthday boy or girl who had a parent present was the 60-year-old whose 89-year-old mum flew out from England and looked like she could out-party anyone except the svelte 17 and 18-year-olds who must have thought they'd happened upon Jurassic Park in the suburbs of Perth.<br>However, there is sometimes a sour note on these occasions and, as is often the case, it happened in the speeches. In one of the dos - and I won't say which, partly out of fear of embarrassing the parties, and partly because I love a good party and can't really remember which was which - the husband made a speech about the birthday girl which shook the entire audience of women.<br>All the other wives were moved to tears by his romanticism. Their little black dresses shook with emotion.<br>The other husbands were aghast. Many and loud were the mutters: ?Ah you've just cruelled it, mate. Now the girls will give us a hard time about not being romantic like you. All we wanted to do was have a beer or three and talk about Justin Langer, Glen Jakovich's knee and Mary Pierce's stature, as compared to Pamela Anderson's.?<br>FOR, as I often say, men and women use entirely different parts of their brains and have entirely different interests.<br>Recently I read more confirmation of this in a little document called The Modern Woman's Guide to Understanding Her Child ... er Husband.<br>It lists what a man actually says and beside it gives a translation of what he actually means. I'll list the sayings, then the translation in brackets after.<br>We need. (I want).<br>Do what you want. (I'll just sit on the couch and sulk).<br>We need to talk. (I need to complain).<br>I'm hungry. ((a) Make me something to eat; (b) Stop what you are doing, scrape together your last dollars, drive to the supermarket, pick up enough for my mates and me, come back, cook, and oh, while you're up, get me a beer).<br>I'm not upset. (Of course I'm upset, but only a wuss would admit it).<br>I'm feeling romantic. (There's no game on tonight).<br>I'm not emotional. (I'm losing my hair).<br>Be romantic, turn off the light. (Beer gut? What beer gut?)<br>This kitchen is so inconvenient. (I can't see the TV from here).<br>The car isn't running right. (I want a bigger engine and more knobs to play with).<br>How much do you love me? (I've done something really stupid and someone's on their way to tell you now).<br>This little work of fantasy, obviously written by a woman, also provides translations to common answers to the question ?what's wrong??.<br>?Nothing? means ?I'm in the middle of a fantasy. Go away?.?Everything? means ?Some gorgeous 18-year-old called me Sir?<br></font></p>
