            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The trouble with technology is that it does not always do what we want. Last week, Massachusetts judge Hiller Zobel reduced a jury's murder verdict against British nanny Louise Woodward to involuntary manslaughter and set her free.<br>He intended to release the decision to the world over the Internet but it ended up going out on paper instead, according to Wired News.<br>?The moment of glory for digital media was waylaid by a power failure in the Boston area, which crashed the Cambridge courthouse computer system shortly before the scheduled release of Zobel's ruling,? said Wired.<br>Another American with a technological vision is Microsoft chairman and chief executive Bill Gates.<br>His book The Road Ahead, published here two years ago, paints some terrific pictures of how Mr Gates sees technology shaping our lives. If you bought the book, you may also have received a companion CD-ROM that turns many of his words and thoughts into video playbacks.<br>Of course, cynics and Mr Gates' numerous critics say, when you are the richest nerd in the world, you can afford to publish your thoughts in this highly sophisticated way. But that should take nothing away from the content.<br>The CD-ROM has a section devoted to videos of futuristic appliances that may be seen in the home, at work or at school. In the home, for example, he has a working mother starting her day by turning on interactive TV. This is a big flat screen in the wall. Flicking the remote enables the mum - or mom (this is American after all) - to pick up her favourite TV shows where she left off.<br>And this being America, she goes straight to Oprah Winfrey. Oh well, no accounting for taste. But the next show is a morning news program. It is November 2004 - just seven years away - the US President is a woman and the main news item is about whether ?the First Husband? can be appointed to Cabinet.<br>That is not the most interesting part, however. Down the right of screen - ironically just like the desktop of an Apple Mac - are a series of icons which will enable ?Mom? to click on news items highlighted by the program.She can go straight to the weather, for example, where the avuncular weather person tells her she can click even more icons for more detailed forecasts.<br>She can cut back to any item or the main bulletin or save the show for later viewing. This is known as asynchronous TV.<br>Over on a smaller console - again with a flat screen - "Mom's? teenage son is watching the news but is gently reminded he has a school project to do. He flicks a button on the remote and immediately he is surfing the Web locating sites for research at phenomenal speed.<br>The interesting thing about all this is that although it was just a futuristic vision two years ago, something closely resembling it has been on show in the US for a year already.<br>That something is known as WebTV. It is a device that sits on top of the TV and can be plugged into a 33.6K modem. With the aid of a wireless keyboard, an otherwise passive TV viewer can connect to the Net. If users have the right type of TV, they can watch a football game, for example, and surf to a football Web site to read vital statistics ? all at the same time.<br>It takes the computing out of the information highway and is intended for people who are a little afraid of the techno-babble associated with PCs. The TV is seen as a more user-friendly way to get people connected.<br>The take-up in the US has not been wildly successful so far. News reports indicate there are only about 150,000 subscribers to the WebTV network, which just happens to be owned by Mr Gates' Microsoft. The Seattle giant bought it from its three creators earlier this year.<br>Somehow, the vision splendid does not yet match reality. For people such as Mr Gates, who eats, sleeps and breathes technology, it seems logical that people would want their main infotainment medium - the TV - made even more informative.<br>We, the punters, appear to have very different ideas, particularly here in Australia where even pay-TV is hardly a huge ?must?.<br>TV is for sitting in front of; computers - particularly the Net - are for beavering away at.<br>And never the twain shall meet... well, not yet anyway.<br>Maybe in November 2004.<br></font></p>
