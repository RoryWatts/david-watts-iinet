            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FACE/OFF<br>After the relative disappointments of Hard Target and Broken Arrow, John Woo has finally pulled off an American picture which captures the hyperbolic high style and bloody poetry of his best Hong Kong work. Woo also pushes his signature theme - that all men have the capacity for good and evil - into dizzying new territory by having the antagonists (played with relish by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta) swap faces. The result is, quite simply, the most outrageously entertaining movie of the year. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas)<br>HERCULES<br>The critics have joined forces with the Greek government to fling sharp-tipped javelins at Hercules, but the real target audience, the kids, gave it a big thumbs-up at the preview. They seemed to care little that Disney's 35th animated feature veers wildly from the original myth and the muscle-bound mortal's 12 mountainous labours, enjoying instead the range of wise-cracking characters (beautifully voiced by James Woods, Danny DeVito, Bobcat Goldthwaith and Matt Frewer among others) that make this lively entertainment, not a slavish retelling of an epic tale. Rated G<br>(David Watts)<br>KISS OR KILL<br>Seeking to rev up his career after the disappointment of his Hollywood debut Two If By Sea, Australian writer-director Bill Bennett has thrown off all the trappings (script, music soundtrack, tripod, continuity editing), giving this story about a pair of sexy con artists on the run from the law and a psychopathic former footy star, an energy and pace rare in local movies. There are some very interesting ideas about truth, lies and pretence in Kiss or Kill, dubbed Nullarbor Noir by one critic. Unfortunately, the plot overheats well before reaching its destination, stranding its talented leads Frances O'Connor and Matt Day in the middle of nowhere. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA (Mark Naglazas).<br>MEN IN BLACK<br>The aliens patrolled by the eponymous hipsters played by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones (think of Reservoir Dogs crossed with the Ghostbusters) are not the marauding big-headed monsters of Independence Day and Mars Attacks! but normal-looking, hard-working folk who are as respectful of the American Dream as the millions who've passed through New York's Ellis Island. They have their quirks - Sylvester Stallone, Madonna, Dennis Rodman and, naturally, Elvis Presley are among the aliens outed by this cheeky movie - but as long as they obey the law there's no problem. The jokes are scurrilous, the special effects sensational but the most amusing notion is that tabloid newspapers are our only reliable source of information. ?Best investigative reporting on the planet,? remarks Jones' veteran alien-buster. ?You can read the New York Times. They get lucky sometimes.? Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN<br>Directed by Sydney Lumet, who has visited this precinct before (The Verdict, Prince of the City), Night Falls on Manhattan deals with a young assistant district attorney (Andy Garcia) who is pulled into a major investigation of corruption in the New York Police Department after his veteran cop father (Ian Holm) is badly wounded in a drug bust. While this sounds like the set-up for an action-packed thriller, Lumet is more concerned with psychology and ethics, digging deep into the souls of men who exist in the shadowy world between guilt and innocence. The narrative doesn't quite hang together and the climax is a bit underwhelming, but the supporting performances are so richly detailed, with Ian Holm again proving that he's the equal of contemporaries Anthony Hopkins and Nigel Hawthorne, that it still holds our interest. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSE DANCING<br>A stomach-turning brew of comedy, romance, disease-of-the-week melodrama, magic realism and New Agey bunkum, this hugely expensive local production is so amateurish you'd be loathed to hire the team responsible to video your wedding, let alone make a movie about one. After a breezy first third, in which a couple (played by the unlikely pair of Jack Thompson and Jacqueline McKenzie) try to organise an impromptu wedding on Rottnest Island, the movie makes the most laughably dramatic bungee jump into melodrama that I can ever recall seeing, with Emma announcing that she has a terminal illness. This is supposed to be about the island coming together to make Harry and Emma's wedding happen. But the only Rottnest residents who become involved in the wedding are a circus troop who perform and the Catholic priest. The rest seem to have been shipped across from Perth's fashionable suburbs with all the other accoutrements for this annoyingly cutesy designer wedding. So where's the magic, the spontaneous outpouring of love for this doomed young woman? The only miracle in this dim, ill-conceived movie is the miracle of electronic funds transfer. It should have been called Under the Credit Card Worshipping. At the Revue Cinemas. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>WAITING FOR GUFFMAN<br>While The Simpson's have already done the small-town theatrical production, with Marge and Ned in the musical version of A Streetcar Named Desire, director-star Christopher Guest gets plenty of laughs in this mockumentary about the about a bunch of no-hoper amateurs in Blaine, Missouri, who are putting on a musical depicting the town's history for its 150th anniversary. They're awful, of course, with New York Off-Off-Off Broadway veteran Corky St Clair (Guest) creating a gloriously campy version of Blaine's history; but director Guest is never condescending towards his starry-eyed performers, treating them with as much humanity as humour. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>YEAR OF THE DOGS<br>Former journalist Michael Cordell had the good fortune to spend 1996 with Footscray (now called the Western Bulldogs) during the most turbulent year in its history, with a series of disasters and merger proposals threatening to wipe this proud working-class club off the map. The film is essentially a fly-on-the wall account of the pain, the passion and the occasional joy of being a footballer - and of being a supporter of a struggling team. Sports fans and cinema-goers will find this look at football goes some way to explaining why sport has such a powerful hold on the national psyche. At the Luna. Rated M (Ron Banks)<br>GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE<br>The swingiest family picture of the year has to be George of the Jungle, a hilarious live-action version of the popular late 1960s cartoon about a Tarzan-like nature boy played by Brendan Fraser (pictured) who lives in a split-level tree house with an English-speaking, violin-playing intellectual gorilla (voice by John Cleese) and has a pet elephant that thinks it's a dog. All these animals are a good deal smarter than George, who's a few bananas short of a full bunch after his tree-crashing vine-swinging, and so is the wonderfully intrusive narrator. In wacky, post-modernist style he keeps butting in, reminding the audience of movie conventions and making corrections when things get too far fetched. Hip, delightfully self-referential and featuring a gorilla singing I Did It My Way in a Las Vegas show, George in the Jungle is wonderful, chest-beating fun. Rated PG<br>THE GAME<br>David Fincher scared the pants off us in his last film, the serial killer thriller Seven, and promises to do much the same with The Game. Starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, the movie is about a businessman who becomes involved in a game in which there seems to be no rules and no objective. However, the stakes are high and the consequences devastating. ?The Game is the best script I've read in years,? says Michael Douglas, high praise indeed from an actor-producer who has been involved in some of the most challenging films to come out of Hollywood in the last few years. Rated M<br>EXILE IN SARAJEVO<br>This passionate, highly personal documentary takes us into the besieged city of Sarajevo at the height of the Bosnian War. Made by Tahir Cambis, an Australian actor of Bosnian extraction who was badly wounded on a journey to his parents' city, and local sound recordist Alma Shabaz, Exile in Saravejo has been described by David Stratton as "uncompromising and challenging . . . an emotionally wrenching depiction of the plight of the citizens of what was once a great, cosmopolitan European city.? Cinema Paradiso. Rated M<br></font></p>
