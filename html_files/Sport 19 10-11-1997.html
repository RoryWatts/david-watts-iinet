            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PERTH'S weather is too good for cricket. Sure it's fine to play the game in, almost perfect in fact.<br>Granted, fielding all through a typical February afternoon can make one think of taking up macrame. But basically it's perfect ... to play. If you want to watch the game on TV it's a very different matter.<br>A little voice from childhood nags as the clouds disappear and the mercury hovers around 27 or 28: ?You can't sit cooped up in the house in front of that TV on a day like today. Get out in the sunshine.?<br>Before this first Test against New Zealand at the Gabba you might have been forgiven for thinking that a spot of lawnmowing, or gardening, or vigorous outdoor exercise would be preferable to watching the lowly Kiwis.<br>Even the dentist might have been more fun than watching a side so awful it had been made to look like a team of schoolboys by Queensland, then NSW.<br>They were supposed to be one of the worst sides to face Australia this century. And there have been some rippers.<br>The first NZ-Australia test on March 29, 1946 in Wellington is a case in point. The Kiwis capitulated on March 30 to a team that included Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Don Tallon, Colin McCool and Ken Meuleman.<br>This disaster meant the Australian Cricket Board did not authorise another NZ Test until 1973-74 when Australian giants like Gary Cosier and Ian Davis (remember them) proved too good. But those who forsook the beautiful spring days of Friday, Saturday and yesterday got much more than the doomsayers predicted.<br>These awful New Zealanders made a fight of it, first by ripping through the Australian middle order, then by some dour batting which made Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne look a little ordinary.<br>The wicket helped of course, but as Richie Benaud told Channel 9 viewers, it was a good, absorbing struggle.<br>The fire of NZ's Chris Cairns, the character of Australian captain Mark Taylor and the newfound batting talent of Paul Reiffel made watching essential.<br>This brings us back to the dilemma - cricket on TV-versus-beautiful day to be outside.<br>How can one manage to do both? The radio is vital to this question. If you're outside it has to be assumed you won't be letting the glib tones of Benaud, the excitable Bill Lawry or the surprisingly sensible Carl Rackemann mingle with the magpies.<br>You could take an extension cord and set up the TV outside. But that could be taking things too far and the magpies might do to the TV what Cairns did to the Aussies.<br>The compromise could be to place the TV in a spot where you can see it from the garden - you may need to renovate and get full-length windows - then turn on Tim Lane, Jim Maxwell, Keith Stackpole et al on the ABC and let them paint their word pictures while you garden intently in the one spot all day. None of these solutions is elegant. They are all much like an Ian Healy innings, crude, workmanlike, but effective.<br>But that's life in paradise for you.<br></font></p>
