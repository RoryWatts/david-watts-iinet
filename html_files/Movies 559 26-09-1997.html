            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>A Simple Wish (G)<br>Martin Short, Mara Wilson, Kathleen Turner<br>Directed by Michael Ritchie<br>H H 12*b<br>SOME films have unfortunate titles. Cindy Crawford's screen debut in Fair Game made her fair game for the critics, for example. The family film, A Simple Wish, suffers the same fate. My simple wish is for it to have been better.<br>Not that it is terrible but it is rather too patchy.<br>The idea of a failed male fairy godmother named Murray (Martin Short) trying and mostly mucking up attempts to grant a wish to young Anabel (Mara Wilson) is a good one.<br>But it needs more than just loopy facial expressions from Murray, or bolshy cuteness from Anabel to make it work.<br>What it really needs is a cohesive narrative rather than this scattergun approach where actors and plot sometimes meet but mostly go their own sweet way.<br>Anabel's simple wish is that her dad, a New York coach driver, get the leading role in a new Broadway musical.<br>Dad (Robert Pastorelli) is a wonderful singer but lacks presence. If he fails, as looks likely given the back-stage conniving, Anabel and her brother will wind up in Nebraska.<br>Murray is not very good at his job of granting wishes and actually lands himself and Anabel in Nebraska where he turns a marauding red-neck into a giant rabbi . . . when he meant to turn him into a little rabbit.<br>Then he turns Anabel's dad into a statue, his coach into a pumpkin and his horse into a mouse.<br>At the same time as Murray is ruining Anabel's wish, former godmother-turned-witch Claudia (Kathleen Turner looking like she wished she was elsewhere) steals all the magic wands in New York. Why is unclear.<br>The wand she wants is the one Murray is wielding ineptly, so their paths cross and the fight to break the spell on Anabel's dad evolves into a fight between good Murray and bad Claudia.<br>In fact it looks so grim that only some very dubious plot twists can help the good guys.<br>Parts of this are handled very well with good laughs and sight gags like the enormous rabbi, the egocentric Broadway star coughing up frogs during an audition and the lovely little performance by Amanda Plummer as a dog called Boots who is turned into Claudia's human companion.<br>But much of it just does not make sense. The in-jokes about Broadway musicals will be beyond the ken of many children and special effects like Murray turning into putty appear to be included simply because they can be done.<br>For a film about magic, A Simple Wish lacks too much of it. One big disappointment is Mara Wilson's Anabel. Wilson was the cutey in Mrs Doubtfire and Matilda where the sparkle in her eyes was compelling.<br>Here she appears too grown up and street-smart to be credible as a child who believes in fairy godmothers . . . especially male ones with silly faces and funny voices.<br></font></p>
