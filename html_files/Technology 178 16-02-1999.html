            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ONE of the reasons the Internet is such an exciting medium is that it is reasonably cheap.<br>Just look at the face of a non-Netizen when you tell them what can be done on the Net in one hour:<br>?Read some of the world's great newspapers and magazines.<br>?Find the lyrics to that 1971 hit humming away in your head.<br>?Help a child with a school project.<br>?Print out a list showing every innings of Steve Waugh's career.<br>?Send an e-mail to the White House, telling Bill Clinton to get on with his job.<br>?And what did that set you back?? the sceptical non-Netizen might ask. ?The cost of a phone call, about 25¢,? is the smug reply.<br>This expectation of cheap surfing makes it hard for people to find ways to make money from the medium.<br>I commented last week that the companies best able to find gold on the Net were probably those that were big and rich already, and could use the Web as a new shopfront to entice the population.<br>Exactly how to do this is a mystery that many are trying to solve.<br>Even a giant money-maker like Bill Gates' Microsoft is going through a learning curve.<br>Almost a year ago it decided the way to enrich itself further was to charge surfers about $30 a year to read its good literary-newsy Web magazine, Slate.<br>Last week Slate did a total flip and announced all its online content would be free again.<br>And it claimed it would get more readers and make more money.<br>?There is too much free stuff out there, the process of paying and accessing what you paid for is too clumsy and unfamiliar,? Slate's editor Michael Kinsley said. According to Wired News, most Web sites that have made money on subscriptions sell either pornography or investment advice.<br>Some publications like the Economist, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have charged subscriptions for their total online product and been happy with increased global circulation.<br>But a newbie like Slate found that only 25,000 people stuck with it when money was demanded.<br>Mr Kinsley says, in a frank and amusing list of answers to imaginary questions about Slate's backflip, that only one in 15 people appeared to take the subscription bait when they looked at the free front page.<br>In his Q and A, Mr Kinsley poses the following: ?Everybody said you can't charge for content on the Internet. Information wants to be free. Unless it's about sex or stocks. But oh no, you knew better. You'd show the world. You'd charge for news digests, for political analysis, for cultural discussions, for poetry. Don't you feel like jerks??<br>He answers his own question thus: ?This is terra incognita. We never claimed to have found the one true path. We tried one thing, now we're trying something else, and we'll keep trying until we figure it out.?<br>As for Mr Gates' response, Mr Kinsley claims the richest man in the world called off his killer dogs when the prospects of a much bigger audience and consequent increased advertising revenue were explained.<br>Slate: www.slate.com<br>Wired News: www.wired.com/news<br></font></p>
