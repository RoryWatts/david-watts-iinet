            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT MIGHT be a case of to Russia with love. Then again it could easily be one of what goes around, comes around.<br>Whatever glib tag is dragged out, it cannot describe the sheer ambition of a project aimed at recycling old computers from WA schools and sending them to Russia.<br>Banjup man Allan Cooke - who is best described as an inventor and ideas man - took possession of 50 old computers from a Perth girls' school last week and is storing them ready for shipment overseas.<br>The assortment of PCs, Apples and Acorns are the first of what he hopes will be a flood of computers from not only WA schools, but schools right around Australia.<br>Their ultimate destination is Russia where technicians are being organised to put life in the old systems so that children there can be empowered with new technology and connect to the Internet.<br>Mr Cooke has named the project Kids Talk and says one definite aim is to have the Russian children using recycled WA computers chatting on the Net to the WA children whose schools have donated the hardware.<br>The idea came to Mr Cooke last year when in his role of president of the Peace Shield Foundation - a body devoted to producing a fairer economic system - he was talking on the Net to Alexei Bykov, the deputy chairman of the Russian Peace Federation.<br>Mr Bykov and he have become regular e-mail correspondents because of the goals of their organisations and the fact that they both have daughters roughly the same age. ?Alexei tells me that in some parts of Russia the Internet is unheard of and the use of computers in schools is very limited,? Mr Cooke said.<br>The two men have signed a contract between Peace Shield and the RPF setting out their desires to give Russian children a badly needed technology boost. The RPF has 69 branches throughout Russia, as well as a base in Canada.<br>Mr Cooke said the philosophy behind the Kids Talk project was to work towards a balance between rich and poor nations. ?It is far better we adopt a policy of helping our neighbours as opposed to beggaring them,? he said.<br>Kids Talk took advantage of the speed at which technology is being developed; a speed that quickly made many items of computer hardware redundant in affluent societies such as Australia, but still workable in places like Russia.<br>The project would allow the children of an advanced nation to help those of a poorer one so that they could have a way to keep up with electronic literacy.<br>It is a massive undertaking which Mr Cooke estimates will take between six and 12 months to take off and could be expanded to include many other countries.<br>He is planning to send circulars to WA schools and hopes that interest will grow to the stage where parents, and through them the companies they work for, will donate resources and expertise to help recycle old computers.<br>He said at the weekend that the project would be ideal for enterprising sponsorship.<br>Schools and individuals who would like to know more can contact Mr Cooke by e-mail at kidstalk@worldfocus.org<br>Peace Shield's Web page is at www.worldfocus.org/index.html<br></font></p>
