            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NETSCAPE'S latest version of the Communicator Web package takes direct aim at the enemy, Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>Version 4.5 of the browser suite - released officially last week to accolades from software reviewers - can be configured to override some Explorer defaults on a Windows system.<br>The so-called Windows-friendly installation lets users choose Navigator and Messenger as their default browser and e-mail client.<br>This is seen as an attempt by Netscape to stake out some territory on Microsoft's turf. Since it released Explorer 3.0 in 1996 MS has tried to blast away Netscape's hold on the browser market, most markedly by being installed free on new PCs with Windows 95 or 98.<br>This latest Netscape move simply allows users a choice which they might not have known existed in the past because IE so easily made itself the default.<br>During set-up, 4.5's installation wizard also asks users if they want to make its Netcenter portal the default start page and search engine.<br>According to c-net's Browser.com, this sounds innocuous. But if users say Yes, the installer takes their Explorer settings hostage: typing a phrase in IE's Location box will bring up a Netcenter/Excite search, rather than the IE/Yahoo search Microsoft prescribed.<br>And there is no simple way to recover original settings.<br>The new Communicator also places icons for its Navigator, Messenger and Composer components in the Windows quick-launch taskbar.<br>And Netscape's Smart Update service appears in the Windows Start menu - just as Microsoft's does.<br>Netscape has clearly decided to fight fire with fire to keep its eroding ascendancy in the market it once used to dominate with more than 85 per cent share. Lately it has dropped closer to 50 per cent as the MSIE juggernaut keeps getting better and more easily available.<br>What the ferocious tactics might hide is Netscape's best ever browser.<br>I have been using it most of the time since its release in preference to MSIE, which has been my choice for several months, mainly because of its big-screen and backspace navigation features.<br>Netscape still hasn't built those into 4.5, but it has sharpened its Smart Browsing features, possibly the only real browsing breakthrough in the past 12 months.<br>Smart Browsing allows users to click on a button marked ?what's related? next to the location box.<br>Communicator then interrogates the growing database at its Netcenter site and displays several sites which it claims are similar to the one the user is looking at. It is a fast and painless way to search the Web.<br>The ability to type words or phrases in the location box and be presented with sites or quick search results also continues to improve.<br>Communicator now appears more stable than it was - the beta versions of 4.5 were especially buggy.<br>But Netscape has learnt much from users through its feedback feature, and released the final version ahead of time.<br>Mail and news also continue to improve and are more stable. The Composer HTML editor still needs a lot of work to match MSIE's Front Page Express, however.<br>Version 4.5 weighs in at around 14Mb and can be installed through Netscape's own automatic update site .<br>If sites like these make you feel you are ceding control of your computer to software giants, check out the Australian-based Black Stump Software.<br>HELP DESK<br>Netscape:<br>www.netscape.com.au<br>Black Stump Software:<br>werple.net.au/ ~lions/software.htm<br>Browser.com:<br>www.browser.com<br>User tips: pcworld.com/heres_how/<br>article/0,1400,8216,00.html<br></font></p>
