            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ARMCHAIR sport lovers have to learn to put up with two things every year.<br>One is Bruce McAvaney gushing over Wayne Carey. The other is Eddie McGuire rabbiting on about Collingwood.<br>Apart from those ear-bashing sins, both talking heads are enthusiastic, knowledgable and very hard-working.<br>Since Friday night's impressive Commonwealth Games opening ceremony on Channel 9, we have been able to see McGuire's affable and easy authority over the network's blanket coverage of what is becoming a fascinating event.<br>But how long can McGuire keep up his journalistic commitments? He led a much publicised boardroom coup at Collingwood last week, putting presidency of the club within his grasp.<br>Can he in all conscience host a football show and break news stories while being privy to executive information at the Magpies?<br>McGuire is on the record as saying he sees no conflict of interest. He was quoted at length by the Melbourne Herald Sun, a paper he writes a weekly column for when not hosting the Footy Show, broadcasting on Radio MMM, espousing the Republican cause or doing odd jobs - like the Games - for Nine.<br>Should the Footy Show now comprise panels full of club executives (it has one already in Hawthorn board member Dermott Brereton), or is it in danger of becoming the Collingwood Show?<br>Peter Everitt had it pretty right last week when he interrupted McGuire at least twice with the words: ?That's enough about Collingwood Ed.?<br>???<br>THE Kuala Lumpur Games is showcasing some amazing one-sided contests - not only in the swimming.<br>The early stages of the rugby tournament have been embarrassing. David Campese's Australians scored 12 tries against Sri Lanka on Sunday night. It looked like a mob of big blokes stealing the ball from a mob of little blokes in the local park.<br>???<br>EVIDENCE of how far TV can intrude on sport came early yesterday when Nine's coverage of Pat Rafter's great US Open win was delayed because the US broadcaster with the rights had not finished showing its Sunday afternoon football match. The women's final was also pushed forward to Saturday because of the football.<br>In the past few years it had shared equal billing with the men's final on Sunday.<br>And on an American theme ... why all the fuss on local TV here about Mark McGwire's home run record in the US? Will Americans flood their airwaves if Tony Lockett breaks Gordon Coventry's goal-kicking record?<br>???<br>THE best football to see this weekend might be on the ABC. If the Westar Rules grand final between East Fremantle and West Perth on Sunday is near as good as the preliminary final, it will be worth lounging around for.<br>Importantly, it will be John Russo-free and advertising-free.<br></font></p>
