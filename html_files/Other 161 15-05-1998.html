            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHEN were the good old days exactly? Many people talk about them but trying to pin them down is a difficult assignment.<br>Was it when wool was a pound a pound; or when gay meant happy; or you could leave your front door unlocked or was it when the Eagles won their last premiership, all the way back in 1994?<br>Whenever they were, the signs that you have experienced the good old days are hard to ignore. Recently a friend of a friend turned 50 and was offered the following heartening advice about his life.<br>You know you are over the hill when:<br>1. You keep repeating yourself.<br>2. Your back goes out more than you do.<br>3. You do the hokey-cokey and put your left hip out ? and it stays out.<br>4. You keep repeating yourself.<br>5. It takes a couple of attempts to get over a speed bump.<br>6. You look both ways before crossing a room.<br>7. You go to a garden party and are mainly interested in the garden.<br>8. You always tell people what a loaf of bread used to cost.<br>9. You start every other sentence with, ?Nowadays?.<br>10. You keep repeating yourself.<br>Nowadays, of course, modern science and technology can bring the good old days right to your mental doorstep with the ability to e-mail memories around the globe. At a recent Internet memory fest in the US, baby boomers - who really aren't that old ? are we? - were asked for recollections of their good old days that they might pass on to the so-called Generation Xers, who are fast hitting 30.<br>Among the wise, old answers were these:<br>In my day, we didn't have a mouse to move the cursor round the computer screen. We only had the arrows. If the up arrow was broken and you needed to get to the top of the screen, well, you just hit the left arrow a thousand times.<br>In my day, we couldn't afford shoes, so we went barefoot. In the winter we had to wrap our feet with barbed wire for traction.<br>In my day, we didn't have hand-held calculators. We had to do addition on our fingers. To subtract, we had to have some fingers amputated.<br>In my day, we didn't have fancy high numbers. We had ?nothing?, ?one?, ?twain? and ?multitudes?.<br>In my day, we didn't have virtual reality. If a one-eyed razorback barbarian warrior was chasing you with an axe, you just had to hope you could outrun him.In my day, we didn't have days. There was only ?time for work?, ?time for play? and ?time for sleep?. The sheriff would go round and tell everyone when to change.<br>In my day, we didn't have water. We had to smash together our own hydrogen and oxygen atoms.<br>Nowadays you would just have to say: ?You were lucky. We used to live in a cardboard box in middle of road ? ? Oh no, that's been said before hasn't it?<br>Walks down memory lane do not always reveal the truth, as the above lot shows. Indeed in those good old days when wool was a pound a pound etc, children died of polio, men thought they had the right to beat their wives, schoolchildren could be caned for trivial offences and cigarettes were regarded as both healthy and a social necessity.<br>Then again, State governments did not believe spending $100 million on a convention centre was more important than funding a hospital system in crisis either. Nor did Federal governments appear to believe it was above-board to scare the pants off people lucky enough to have a job by barracking for a company that resorted to stripping assets and hiring heavies with dogs to put their workforce on the street.<br>Nowadays, is it any wonder that it sometimes feels safer to live in those good old days.<br></font></p>
