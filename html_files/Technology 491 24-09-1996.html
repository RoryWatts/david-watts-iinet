            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer has made significant inroads into Netscape Navigator's domination of the World Wide Web browser market, according to a US survey.<br>Interse, makers of Web analysis software for business, says MSIE version 3.0 has jumped from a 7 per cent share when it first appeared in beta packages in May, to 29 per cent last month, when the official release made its global debut.<br>In the same time Navigator use has dropped 20.5 percentage points from 83.2 to 62.7. Navigator also released its newest version - 3.0 - last month, and Interse figures show it is steadily gaining favour with Netscape users.<br>The figures are a major boost for Microsoft because it has set Internet domination as a goal.<br>Also significant is the fact that most use of MSIE is on Windows95 or NT platforms only, which still account for slightly less than half of Net users. An earlier version, 2.x can be acquired for Windows 3.x and Macintosh.<br>Netscape can be used on 16 different operating platforms.<br>MSIE 3.0 is used by 90 per cent of Windows Explorer users, therefore Microsoft has more than 25 per cent of less than half the total market, or close to 50 per cent of the total market based on a straight statistical projection.<br>That sort of projection is academic only because the reality so far is that MSIE 3.0 has yet to be ported to Mac, Windows 3.1 or Unix platforms.<br>However, Microsoft is working towards that and when it does, MSIE 3.0 could erode Navigator's share even more significantly.<br>But Microsoft is far less likely to get the same sort of free hand in these areas as it did with its own operating system. This is because MSIE was bundled with Win95, but will be an additional download on any other vendor's OS.<br>Interse's Webtrends survey carries figures of browser use since November 1994 when NCSA Mosaic had 60 per cent of the market and the then-fledgling Netscape had 13. Other browsers - many of which have sunk under the Netscape onslaught - had 27 per cent.<br>The official and free release of MSIE 3.0 appears to have been the spur for the jump in market share.<br>URLs:<br>www.interse.com/webtrends/<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/<br>test/b<br></font></p>
