            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIAN Government hopes to regulate the Internet by allowing users to label sites - self-censorship - hit a major snag at the weekend.<br>The main users' group, Electronic Frontiers Australia, condemned the most favoured labelling system as parochial, inflexible, and archaic.<br>The system has been developed by the US think-tank, the Recreational Software Advisory Council, and has been used in conjunction with the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) to rate sites and allow the blocking of access to those considered unsuitable.<br>The RSAC claims more than 15,000 sites are rated on the World Wide Web. Access can be blocked by applying labels to certain software.<br>On Sunday, EFA board member Danny Yee attacked the labelling method on behalf of his association, which was set up in 1994 to ?promote and defend the civil liberties of users?.<br>?The RSAC system has no way of distinguishing material with artistic, literary, or scientific value,? Mr Yee said.<br>?It is in this regard atavistic, a return to an era when Shakespeare was Bowdlerised and the penises were chiselled off classical statues.<br>?The definitions used in determining the four ratings - for language, nudity, sex, and violence - were clearly chosen with computer games in mind and lack the flexibility required for a wider range of materials.<br>?It is ludicrous that such a system should be applied to novels, online libraries, art galleries, and other such resources.?<br>Mr Yee also criticised the Australian Broadcasting Authority for labelling its own Web site with RSAC.<br>The RSAC says at its Web site that its aim in creating rating standards is to protect children and protect the rights of free speech for people who publish on the Web.<br>?We also designed a system based on the tried and tested content advisory system used for computer games and one which could be simply understood and set by parents,? the RSAC says.<br>The council also says it is trying to encourage Internet content providers to use RSAC's voluntary, self-disclosure rating system.<br>But these views are disputed by another EFA spokesman, Irene Graham.<br>At her anti-censorship Web site she describes labelling as censorship by stealth.<br>?Claims that all material, particularly material unsuitable for children, must be labelled in order to protect children are technologically ignorant at best, insidious at worst,? she says.<br>Ms Graham says compulsory labelling - being considered by the ABA - allows governments to censor by stealth.<br>ABA chairman Peter Webb said last week the authority was particularly interested in how parents could use labelling schemes, such as RSAC's, to protect minors using the Net.<br>URLs:<br>RSAC home page<br>www.rsac.org/<br>The Net Labelling Delusion<br>www.thehub.com.au/~rene/liberty/label.html<br>ABA Web site<br>www.dca.gov.au/aba/hpcov.html<br></font></p>
