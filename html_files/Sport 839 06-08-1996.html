            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">KIEREN PERKINS just failed to do it; the Oarsome Foursome went close, and Michael Johnson was thousandths of a second away. It took the much-sculptured face of Little Richard singing Good Golly Miss Molly to push Sandy Roberts and Garry Wilkinson off the volume scale.<br>In the process the rock and roll icon turned a jolly celebration into a blast of a party in the main Olympic stadium.<br>Thousands of athletes, poised on their blocks for the closing ceremony finale, beat the starter's gun by minutes and danced, sang and conga-lined their way on to the arena.<br>How could they resist? The whole show oozed fun and spontaneity. In fact its most serious moment up to then had been the comparatively sophisticated 10-minute preview of what Sydney 2000 will offer the world.<br>Didgeridoos, snaking, svelte dancers, Bondi surf lifesavers in bright blue and inflatable kangaroos borne by mountain-bike riders might not sound that sophisticated.<br>But it was beautifully done and even languorous in comparison to the fest of junk culture and Western capitalist decadence that preceded it.<br>In the home of CNN and that ubiquitous cola, what else could you expect but dozens of talented kids on skateboards, blade skates and mountain bikes competing for stage time with rolling, tumbling gymnasts? Wonderful.<br>But when Little Richard was paraded in with his portable piano, Wilkinson and Roberts, already ecstatic, nearly had joint heart attacks of pure excitement.<br>?It's Little Richard; my hero; the greatest ...? one, or both together, shouted.<br>Then the athletes rushed on, unable to contain their exuberance and their doubtful dancing skills.<br>The crowd had already heard B.B. King, soulful Al Green and Stevie Wonder. Little Richard was followed by Gloria Estefan. Then the announcers, to the incredulity of everyone, said: ?The concert will now begin.?<br>A few minutes later King, Little Richard, Wonder, Green and Estefan were joined by others, including Sheila E. and the Pointer Sisters.<br>Swimmer Daniel Kowalski looked understandably dumbstruck as he wandered about in a daze with his cap on backwards, American-style.<br>Channel 7 has been adamant for the past week that ?no Australian should miss the historic closing ceremony?.<br>In a voice deep and profound, this message seemed to imply that anyone not in front of their set would be executed for treason.<br>The reason, of course, was to watch the handing over of the Olympic flag. Michael Johnson brought it in; it was handed to the Mayor of Atlanta, then to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and then to Sydney's Lord Mayor Frank Sartor.<br>He looked chuffed as he strolled off with the Australian flag-toting Oarsome Foursome.<br>After Atlanta's logistical disasters with transport and communications, plus the awful bomb, we can only hope that the flag does not become too much of a cross to bear.<br></font></p>
