            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Depression-era Australians needed a hero. The fact that he was a New Zealander, had four legs and sometimes started at unbackable odds mattered little. He was a winner.<br>DAVID WATTS tells the story of Phar Lap.<br>SOME of the horses running round Flemington, Caulfield and Moonee Valley this spring will make a name for themselves. Others will merely be good. Some that a few of us will punt on will be donkeys.<br>It is 100/1-on that none will have the magic of Phar Lap who died 65 years ago but whose legend for near invincibility shows few signs of fading.<br>The mighty gelding began racing in 1929 just as the great Depression started to choke much of the life out of Australia. Wool and wheat prices were spiralling down, banks were heartless, industries collapsed and more than 25 per cent of the workforce became unemployed.<br>The people needed winners to bring some joy to their grim lives. One was Don Bradman the master batsman, just coming of age.<br>The other was Phar Lap.<br>That this champion even got to race is a minor miracle.<br>He was born in the green paddocks of Timaru, New Zealand, in 1926, and sold for the bargain price of 160 guineas ($336) to Hugh Telford on behalf of his brother, Harry, a Sydney trainer. Harry convinced American-born David J. Davis to buy the horse.<br>Davis did not like what he saw when Phar Lap arrived. The big red horse was skinny and clumsy, with warts all over his head. An angry Davis made a deal with Harry Telford in which Telford leased Phar Lap for three years, paid for his feed and training expenses and kept any prizemoney. Davis obviously doubted there would be any.<br>Telford, a student of racing pedigrees, thought Phar Lap, sired by Night Raid out of Entreaty, had the right breeding to be a champion.<br>So the horse was packed off to the stables under the care of a young boy called Tommy Woodcock who called the gelding Bobby instead of his given name, a Thai phrase meaning ?wink of the skies? or ?lightning?.<br>Phar Lap was a big horse at 17 hands or 208cm. He had powerful leg muscles and a strong heart, which, after his death, was discovered to be one of the biggest found in a racehorse.<br>None of that mattered when he made his track debut in the Nursery Handicap at Rosehill, Sydney, on February 23, 1929. He finished ninth.<br>Then came an eighth at provincial Hawkesbury, followed by a 14th and a 13th at Rosehill and Randwick.<br>It was hardly an auspicious start.<br>Phar Lap got his first look at the winner's circle in his fifth race. It was at Rosehill on April 27 in the six-furlong (1300m) Maiden Juvenile. The prize was 180 pounds.<br>It took another five races before he was in the money again - this time second in the Sydney Tattersalls Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick on September 14.<br>After that Phar Lap was unplaced only once more - in the Melbourne Cup of 1931.<br>The record shows Phar Lap went on to win some of the most prestigious races in Australia, including the 1930 Melbourne Cup at 11/8-on and the W S Cox Plate at Moonee Valley in 1930 and 1931.<br>He won five races in one week during the 1930 Spring Carnival. And from September 1929 he started favourite in all but one of his races.<br>The battlers had a real champion to cheer.<br>However, Phar Lap's phenomenal success did not make him popular with everyone. The bookmakers, for instance, lost fortunes when he won.<br>On the morning of November 1, 1930, Derby Day at Flemington, Tommy Woodcock, on a pony, was leading his charge back from a workout to his stables when a car pulled up beside them.<br>Woodcock pushed Phar Lap against a fence, using himself and his pony as a shield as shots were fired. The car sped away.<br>Phar Lap was unhurt and won the Melbourne Stakes at Flemington that day.<br>The gunman was never identified.<br>Just three days later Phar Lap won the Melbourne Cup easily, even though he carried 62.5kg, or 4kg more than any other four-year-old had carried in a Cup.<br>In the 1931 Cup he carried 68kg. This proved too much even for him, and he finished eighth in his last Australian race.<br>The champion set sail for North America in 1932 with Woodcock as the trainer. Davis, the born-again owner, provided Phar Lap with his own exercise enclosure and sand-box for the voyage.<br>The horse had an injured hoof when he arrived but still won the Agua Caliente Jockey Club Handicap near Tijuana in Mexico in record time.<br>It was his last race.<br>On April 5, 1932, Phar Lap was resting at a private ranch near Menlo Park in California while his owner negotiated more race appearances and a series of films.<br>Woodcock found the horse looking ill. His temperature was up and he was in great pain.<br>At midday Phar Lap haemorrhaged and died.<br>Woodcock threw himself on the horse and cried.<br>The death stunned Australia. Prime Minister Joseph Lyons called it a great tragedy. The Sydney Mail commissioned Banjo Paterson to write a tribute.<br>An autopsy found that Phar Lap's stomach and intestines were inflamed, indicating possible poisoning. Rumours spread that he had been deliberately poisoned.<br>Investigation of the ranch showed that some trees had recently been sprayed with a lead-arsenate insecticide, suggesting some of the deadly spray might have drifted on to grass that Phar Lap then ate.<br>A second autopsy suggested that Phar Lap had died of a colicky condition (bad stomach pains), possibly from eating damp feed.<br>His heart, which weighed 6.3kg, was donated to the Institute of Anatomy (now the National Museum) in Canberra and his skeleton to the New Zealand National museum in Wellington.<br>At the National Museum in Melbourne (now the Museum of Victoria), Phar Lap's hide was mounted over a shell of timber covered with roofing paper, burlap and sawdust. Pieces of cord were used to suggest his veins.<br>The mounted Phar Lap has left the museum only once since 1933, Melbourne Cup week in 1980.<br>He had returned to Flemington - 50 years after his legendary cup win.<br>Phar Lap <> The Facts<br>Foaled: Timaru, New Zealand, October 4, 1926<br>Died: Menlo Park, California, April 5, 1932<br>Sire: Night Raid; Dam: Entreaty<br>Colour: Chestnut; Sex: Male (gelding); Height: 17 hands (208cm); Weight of Heart: 6.3kg<br>Owners: 1926-28 Mr A.F.
