            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MEN are such pervs. It helps to explain why Ric Ardon's jaw dropped to the desk and his eyes popped out after Channel 7 news showed Liz Hurley arrive at the Sydney premiere of Mickey Blue Eyes last week. It also is why Chrissy Morrisey had an outburst of the giggles at the reaction of her Channel 10 male newsreading colleagues to Ms Hurley's arrival at the Melbourne premiere the following night.<br>Those dresses worn - well almost worn - by the shapely girlfriend of Hugh Grant rated high on the droolometer.<br>The perv factor helps explain how former Australian Rupert Murdoch started making very serious money. It was 30 years ago this week that Mr Murdoch took control of the London Sun and propelled it from a dull loser of a newspaper to a lying, scheming, sensationalist success of a rag.<br>What really got the Sun noticed happened a year after Mr Murdoch's takeover. It was the birth of the page three girl. A conservative estimate reveals that about 8000 pairs of nipples have graced the tabloid since then.<br>But on October 22, the appearance of Tasty Tara, 25, in a bra, followed by more than a week of clothed crumpet, spelt the dawn of a new era. The occasional topless shot gets through, but it appears the paper's deputy editor Rebekah Wade has had a win over the Dirty Digger with her protestations that topless models are turning women readers off and, more importantly, into the arms of the competition.<br>Mr Murdoch has faced these complaints from women for years, not least from former wife Anna and daughter Elizabeth. Ms Wade is believed to have succeeded this time because Mr Murdoch's new wife, Wendi Deng, is a fierce opponent of the page three girl.<br>Times have changed too. Columnist Julie Burchill wrote in the Observer recently that when the nipple assault started in 1970, pretty women were dollies and birds, and anyone who objected to men looking at pictures of naked women was a dragon, a gorgon or an old bag.<br>It did brighten up gloomy old London though. Living in Perth with its easy abundance of flesh - take a stroll along the beach to see the benefit of a good climate - you can easily forget that the average London bloke has to mentally strip off about six layers of clothes before he can have the same sort of perv that West Australians do.<br>But who needs page three now? One modern tool that renders it redundant is the Internet. Research for this column led me to a page that had links - cyber cross-references - to 28 Web sites devoted entirely to pictures of the most famous page three girl of them all, Samantha ?Oh look, my clothes have fallen off? Fox.<br>I didn't look at all 28 sites - there's more to life than work - but did have a peek at one in which some besotted fan had put topless pictures of nearly every girl to have stripped for the Sun. And I also visited the two newsgroups, or electronic bulletin boards, built to worship Ms Fox.<br>They were in the process of being flooded by pictures of Ms Fox - topless, nude, partially clothed, fully clothed, singing, with her mum on holiday - by an addict who claimed he would transmit 1820 pictures, or 100MB of data, altogether.<br>The Net is but a part of a world in which the sight of Sam Fox's breasts is nowhere the titillation . . . sorry . . . that it once was. There's cleavage everywhere you look; just check out the social pages.<br>And just to be sure, I've set myself an arduous assignment for next week. I'm going to check out all the Web sites devoted to pictures of Liz Hurley arriving at film premieres. No, don't try to stop me, someone's got to do it.<br>And men are such pervs.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
