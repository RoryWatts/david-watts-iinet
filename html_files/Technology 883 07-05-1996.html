            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MICROSOFT chairman Bill Gates cannot sleep at night because of Marc Andreesen, the 24-year-old inventor of Netscape.<br>The revelation about Mr Gates' troubled sleeping habits came at c/net's first Internet Awards for Excellence last week, the first attempt at an Oscars like ceremony on the Net.<br>Mr Andreesen, now vice-president of technology at Netscape and a millionaire because of his World Wide Web browser was named Person of the Year. Netscape was Browser of the Year.<br>Netscape revolutionised the Web, making it easy for surfers the world over to read documents, view images and run applications on the Web. It is used by 84 per cent of Web surfers, according to recent research published on the Web. In fact the program is the reason Web surfing has become so big.<br>Mr Gates' Microsoft, the giant of software, is now dedicated to making a big presence on the Net. But Netscape with its inventiveness and flexibility has kept the Seattle mega-corporation in second place, hence Mr Gates's sleepless nights.<br>C/net, a US company devoted to keeping track of Internet developments, decided to run an awards ceremony to ?honour the people and products that have made the Net such a revolutionary new medium?.<br>C/net claims that more than 5000 people watched the ceremony on the Net.<br>There were few surprises among the winners but among the finalists - chosen by c/net staff - was a quaint relic of the past brought up to date in electrifying fashion.<br>In the online games category, Monopoly scored a mention, passing go and definitely getting out of jail free.<br>The judges summarised that Monopoly might seem a strange choice as a finalist. After all players could not shoot, maim or kill anyone.<br>?But Westwood Studios' PC-based version of this American classic is without peer,? the c/net judges said.<br>Award winners:<br>Browser: Netscape; search engine: Alta Vista; online game: Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness; peripheral: US Robotics Courier V Everything modem; Web server system: Silicon Graphics WebForce Indy; development tool: Java; person: Marc Andreesen.<br></font></p>
