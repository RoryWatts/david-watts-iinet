            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHICKENS copped a roasting in this column on Monday with famous people's answers to the great question, why did the chicken cross the road?<br>I'm afraid to say that our feathered friends are in for it again. They are the subject of this story sent to me by my Washington, DC, friend Kevin, who says the person who sent it to him swears it is true. I couldn't verify the veracity, so present it in the interests of poultry everywhere.<br>The story, published in a recent issue of Meat&Poultry magazine, quoted Feathers, the publication of the California Poultry Industry Federation, with the following:<br>The US Federal Aviation Administration has a unique device for testing the strength of windscreens on planes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a windscreen at approximately the speed the plane flies.<br>The theory is that if the windscreen doesn't crack from the impact, it will survive a real collision with a bird during flight.<br>The British became interested in this and wanted to test a windscreen on a brand new, fast train they're developing.<br>They borrowed the FAA's chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired. The ballistic chicken shattered the windscreen, went through the engineer's chair, broke an instrument panel and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine cab.<br>The British were stunned and asked the FAA to recheck the test to see if everything was done correctly.<br>The FAA reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation: ?Use a thawed chicken next time.?<br>???<br>PUNTING on the Melbourne Cup is a sin, an abomination, a festering pustule on the bottom of society ... in short, a joke. By this you can guess my fancy has yet to round the home turn.<br>But for the keener student of the game than I turned out to be, there was an obvious portent to Saintly's great win.<br>The last horse to win the Cox Plate and the Melbourne Cup was Rising Fast in 1954.<br>That was 42 years ago ... 42 we should know was the answer to the meaning of life in Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy (which ended up being told in four parts).<br>Another cup day story was told to me by a GYM (gorgeous young mum). She lunched at a do put on by one of Perth's top Catholic boys' schools.<br>The principal, a priest, told the gathering that he could not resist a flutter on cup day. He walked into his local TAB ?and remembering who I was and what my teaching told me, I had no option but to put a few dollars on Saintly?.<br>Someone up there liked him obviously.<br>???<br>BOSSES often cop a lot of flak from lesser mortals. And why not ... here are a few quotes to keep the pot stirring.<br>Boss quote 1: We are going to continue having these meetings, every day, until I find out why no work is getting done.<br>Boss quote 2: I didn't say it was your fault. I said I was going to blame it on you.<br>Employee quote 1: My boss frequently gets lost in thought. That's because it's unfamiliar territory.<br>Employee quote 2: Some people climb the ladder of success. My boss walked under it.<br>???<br>TRIVIA TIME: And now it's back to the Deb and Jennifer Totally Useless Page on the Internet for some more gems.<br>The correct response to the Irish greeting, ?Top of the morning to you?, is ?and the rest of the day to yourself?.<br>Giraffes have no vocal cords.<br>In Disney's Fantasia, the Sorcerer's name is Yensid (Disney backwards.)<br>Anne Boleyn had six fingernails on one hand.<br></font></p>
