            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CHANNEL 7 is about to invite us to an orgy of football but, frankly, it is still far too hot to talk about anything but summer sport.<br>Specifically that means cricket. The golf has been good, as usual, basketball has been forgettable, baseball non-existent and soccer, unfortunately, badly dealt with on TV. But cricket has given us these memories:<br>?The excitement of Adam Gilchrist's batting.<br>? Shane Warne's aggressive captaincy in the one-dayers.<br>? The massive chip on Arjuna Ranatunga's shoulder that has led to disgraceful onfield antics and spoilt Sri Lanka's summer here. One suspects that Ranatunga would be a much-loved character if he captained Australia. He does anything for his country.<br>? Darren Gough's never-say-die fast bowling.<br>? The accolades from all sides for Mark Taylor on his retirement.<br>Apart from Taylor, the only Australian sportsman liked as much for his ability as for being an all-round good bloke is possibly tennis star Pat Rafter.<br>All that is likely to change for Taylor in the next year or so.<br>If, as widely expected, he goes the way of past captains and becomes a TV commentator, then he will find himself the target of brickbats.<br>He earned a lot of applause when he made his guest debut during the one-dayers last month. And reports from the east suggest he will be groomed as the successor to Richie Benaud. The same reports also suggest that Tony Greig has his eyes on that job.<br>To which, you have to thumb through the John McEnroe phrase book and say: ?Can you be serious.?<br>The only real quibbles over Taylor's informed commentary were with his voice. Otherwise, he charmed cricket lovers into switching from ABC radio, or gave welcome up-to-date relief from the opinions of Ian Chappell and Greig.<br>These two constantly say what he would do if captain. Taylor knew what his blokes were going to do.<br>After a year away from his team, Taylor will probably be less effective in tapping into the onfield mood. And let's face it ... no one likes cricket commentators.<br>The more people you talk to, the more you find dislikes of this one or that one until the whole team is condemned, even Benaud.<br>It is a thankless job. Viewers remember the positives in the game - like Gilchrist's batting or Gough's attitude - but they remember only this about the commentators:<br>? Bill Lawry shouts of ?it's all happening?, or going on about the glorious MCG.<br>? Chappell talking about Les Favell, his early days at Adelaide Oval or the toffy St Peter's boys' school.<br>? Greig disagreeing with anybody about anything except the state of the ?putch?.<br>? Benaud reserving praise for leg-spinners and New South Welshmen.<br>Taylor will probably suffer the same fate.<br>It is a pity, but no one's perfect.<br></font></p>
