            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PRIME MINISTER John Howard is up to something. No doubt many people believe he is always up to something. But this time it looks like something big. And it will happen next March.<br>How do we know this? Well, last Friday Mr Howard issued a press release saying the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had accepted his invitation and would visit our shores in the second half of March.<br>Mr Howard is preparing to foist them on the great unwashed so that gaggles of school kiddies can buy cheap plastic flags and wave them at big, black cars which they have no hope of looking into so they can actually see their majesties.<br>And bands of loyal monarchists will no doubt dot royal routes waiting to say their two bobs' worth to current affairs reporters.<br>?I did but see her passing by, but I shall love her till I die,? they will mutter . . . or words to that effect.<br>But what everyone will want to hear is Prince Philip's latest gaffe.<br>He was at it again this week. During a visit to an electronics company near Edinburgh, the Duke quipped that a fuse box looked ?as if it was put in by an Indian?.<br>There was immediate outrage from bastions of political correctness. But honestly did anyone expect anything less? It had been a while since his last gaffe, so he was a time-bomb waiting to go off.<br>The Indian remark joined illustrious company. Three months ago the Duke angered deaf people during a visit to the new Welsh Assembly. He was with a group from the British Deaf Association whose members were standing near a band. He pointed to the musicians and said: ?Deaf? If you are near there, no wonder you are deaf.?<br>His best - or worst - effort was 13 years ago during a royal visit to China. He told British students: ?If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.?<br>Given the regularity of the gaffes, the Duke should be ready to make another pearler about next March, at precisely the time he and the Queen are delighting Australian women's magazines.<br>Perhaps he will be marching through a suburb when he spots a regulation dag in a pair of thongs. ?Better be careful, old chap, or they'll deport you back to Queensland,? might be his response.<br>Maybe someone in ugg boots and a checked flannel shirt will inspire him. ?I didn't know they allowed New Zealanders in to these events,? the Duke could chuckle.<br>Whatever he says will make the front pages and dominate the TV news. Ric Ardon will adopt his most serious tones to announce the Duke has angered West Australians while on a visit to Manjimup by promising to dust off his old chainsaw and show city folk what they do with old-growth forests in Europe.<br>All part of a perfect plot for Mr Howard. He can then wheedle some scandalously undemocratic policy into action without worrying about public scrutiny. The public will be too busy scrutinising the Duke's words and the Queen's fashion sense, or lack thereof.<br>What Mr Howard has on the agenda for March is impossible to say at the moment. Maybe it will be a short list of nominees for president of the republic.<br>Imagine the list (and his observations):<br>Nicole Kidman - everyone will look at her but there may be a problem because a proportion of the electorate has seen her bottom in Eyes Wide Shut.<br>Tony Lockett - has free time now he's given away goal-kicking but may place critics in vice-like headlocks.<br>Eddie McGuire - president or host of everything else but could insist government is run from the Crown Casino and televised live and exclusively on Channel 9.<br>Mick Malthouse - all the right qualifications but may be otherwise engaged.<br>Prince Philip - now there's an idea. Could keep the electorate's mind off what we in the Government are up to . . .<br></font></p>
