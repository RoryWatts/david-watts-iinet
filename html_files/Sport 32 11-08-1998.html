            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE last three rounds of the AFL season are certain to test WA supporters' love of their TV sets ... and possibly severely strain their health as well.<br>Fremantle fans have suffered enough anguish already. But the bad news is there looks to be more on the way, starting on Friday night at the MCG against a rampant North Melbourne.<br>West Coast fans will be biting whatever comes to hand - hopefully their knuckles - in Sunday's game against Richmond, which looms as a virtual elimination final.<br>Dockers supporters might get some comfort against Port Adelaide at Subiaco on Sunday, August 23. The Power has had a disappointing second year.<br>Then again, Fremantle has had an even more disappointing fourth year.<br>Its season finishes with Hawthorn at Waverley and the Hawks are starting their 1999 flag chase right now with fast and skilful, direct contests.<br>All in all, not terrific news for depressed Dockers still mumbling at the injuries, fumbles and missed opportunities that have taken much of the gloss away from their thrill-a-minute wins over North, St Kilda and Adelaide.<br>After Richmond - which might just capitulate without a key forward - the Eagles take on St Kilda at Waverley, then wind up against a resurgent Adelaide at Subiaco.<br>Though St Kilda is playing more like St Hilda's - and no disrespect to the Mosman Park girls school - that sort of form might just be an aberration.<br>And the Crows look deadly dangerous.<br>It will be three weeks of agonising drama, particularly if the Eagles follow their curious 1998 script and play as they did against Sydney on Sunday.<br>The best advice for Eagles fans might be to miss the first quarter and just watch the last three - the players mostly do.<br>This year, the Eagles have won 13 of the 19 final three quarters. On five of the six occasions when they have lost the last three quarters, they have also lost the match. The exception was that strange two-point win against Port.<br>Their most remarkable three-quarter win was the amazing eight-goal comeback against Western Bulldogs in round 10. West Coast outscored the Bulldogs by 61 points in those three terms but won the match by only 13.<br>Be warned all those who might want to jump on the bandwagon of a team likely to play in the finals: it takes courage and strong medicine.<br>The come-from-behind Eagles make for edge-of-the-seat viewing.<br>Consider that you will watch a team hailed as the best of the 90s do everything in its power to win - including full nelsons, according to Swans coach Rodney Eade.<br>But to get to that heroic stage they do a lot of dumb things, too.<br>Against Sydney that included Peter Matera being caught with the ball, Ben Cousins running too far and the otherwise impressive debutant Rowan Jones fumbling with the goalmouth wide open.<br>Critics say the Eagles are boring. Yes, about as boring as a roller-coaster ride.<br>?THANKS for the letters about Channel 7 coverage. More on your views next week.<br></font></p>
