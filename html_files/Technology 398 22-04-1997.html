            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">HEAVY casualties are feared in the latest explosions from the Microsoft-Netscape World Wide Web browser war.<br>And the victims will be Internet users, according to US computer writers.<br>Jesse Berst, the editorial director of Ziff-Davis Publishing's Anchor Desk has even created an online petition which he wants presented to both companies as a protest against their growing feud.<br>The catalyst for Mr Berst's concern was Netscape's announcement last week that its next release of the Communicator software suite would have its own brand of ?push? technology called Netcaster.<br>Push software delivers Web content straight to a user's desktop via their browser. The most popular example of it is PointCast News, said to be used by 15 million people worldwide.<br>But Netscape's version of push, expected to be on the Communicator release in June, is radically different from that released with Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 platform preview.<br>Mr Berst believes if the companies continue separate development paths then users will be forced to take sides. MSIE users will not be able to download Netscape-enabled sites and vice-versa.<br>MSIE 4.0 has taken the Web by storm, delivering a total Internet view of operating systems, rather than just being a complete Net tool like Communicator.<br>One of its features is Channel Definition Format which enables users to subscribe to sites. MSIE 4.0 can then be programmed to hunt for those sites at pre-determined times, whether the user is at the computer or not, and deliver updated sites to the hard drive.<br>Netscape's Netcaster will do much the same. However, to take full advantage of it, Web publishers will have to use Netscape's version of Dynamic HTML. But what they create will not be seen by MSIE browsers.<br>Different Dynamic HTML standards set alarm bells ringing in the browser war when MSIE 4.0 was released. Again, Microsoft has one version and Netscape another. Both offer much more control over Web page content and delivery.<br>But neither is easily recognised by the opposition browser, meaning an MSIE 4.0 user runs the risk of not being able to see a page created under Netscape standards, and vice-versa.<br></font></p>
