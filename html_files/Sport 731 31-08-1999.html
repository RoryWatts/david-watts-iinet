            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHO needs Neighbours or Home and Away when you can watch the Eagles - surely one of the most unpredictable soap operas on TV?<br>Here is the plot: A gifted youngster is being groomed for great things.<br>His talent seems awesome enough to make him an astronaut or neurosurgeon (AFL premier or gallant runner-up at the least).<br>Then halfway through a series where he has defeated nearly all his toughest opponents, something inexplicable happens.<br>Maybe he is kidnapped for medical experiments and given mind-altering drugs.<br>Perhaps he is given a heart transplant, who knows?<br>But from that moment, the gifted youngster goes on the skids.<br>He no longer keeps up with his studies, his mind is elsewhere, he is unwilling to work.<br>As a result, his little brother beats him up, then a rehabilitated youth from the north nearly kills him.<br>But he shows signs of recovery, only to slip at the last moment; not once but twice.<br>In the latest episode last Saturday night, he was given an easy test to gain some confidence before the big exams.<br>And he failed miserably.<br>Now, with his worried uncle Mick looking on, seemingly powerless to find an answer, the youngster must totter off to Melbourne on Friday night to confront his demons (or his Bulldogs to be exact).<br>What will happen next? Will we viewers be subjected to another horror episode?<br>Or will some miracle occur to set the youth back on his rightful path?<br>If you are not a fan of soap opera, you don't have to watch this heart-gripping melodrama on Channel 7 of course. Seven is not budging on its 6pm news and the match telecast to Perth will be delayed so you can cheat, find out the progress score before John Russo and Jason Dunstall start blighting the airwaves with their endless chatter, and take it from there.<br>If you're lucky enough to have pay-TV, you can flick to the highlights of the US Open tennis for three hours and spare yourself any heartache.<br>FOXTEL proved its usefulness on Saturday night.<br>When St Kilda started its merciless second-quarter rampage against the Eagles, Fox Sports was showing the Pan Pacific swimming (a delayed version of Channel 9's earlier coverage).<br>Ray Warren's loud monotone was far preferable to watching Eagles handpasses land softly in the hands of flying St Kilda defenders.<br>Michael Klim's bald body thrashed scenes of Jason Heatley thrashing Ashley McIntosh.<br>Then Fox Sports showed the Bledisloe Cup rugby in front of 107,000 at Stadium Australia.<br>The spectacle of a fervent world record crowd singing Waltzing Matilda easily beat the tragi-comic sight of Eagles jumping into each other and spoiling easy marks.<br>Australia's record 28-7 mauling of New Zealand turned Guy McKenna's head count into even more of a farce.<br>Foxtel did not have many options to yet another Fremantle fade-out on Sunday unfortunately.<br>Anything would have been preferable ... even a frontal lobotomy.<br></font></p>
