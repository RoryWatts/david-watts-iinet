            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ROY and H.G. used to introduce This Sporting Life with the phrase, ?when too much sport is barely enough?. We have just had a week the comic duo would have been proud of ... and boy was it good.<br>Let's look at what happened.<br>The world swimming championships on Seven:<br>?To use his own words, Bruce McAvaney was special. Once again he proved he could talk under water with a mouthful of gravel about most sports.<br>?Neil Brooks built on his impressive commentary display at the Atlanta Olympics by adding big doses of genuine warmth and humour for his old sport to his encyclopaedic knowledge of turns and starts.<br>?Steve Foley might have to retire from diving commentary. He has now seen it all. Nearly every dive in the men's 10m platform preliminaries was ?the best you'll ever see?. Indeed three competitors scored perfect 10s from certain judges.<br>?Linley Frame and Hayley Lewis, like Brooksie, showed tremendous enthusiasm for their old sport. Swimming, despite its mind-numbing grind on the young - 12km a day, starting at 5am - somehow produces much camaraderie and a refreshing lack of cynicism.<br>?All were guilty of asking, ?what was your plan??. One day someone will answer: ?I aimed to be last, but unfortunately ended up in the medals?.<br>?It almost goes without saying that Michael Klim was the star, but his obvious enjoyment at being with Alexander Popov - and vice-versa - was good to watch.<br>?Seven kept the Live and Exclusive tag on its delayed coverage back to Perth during the week. However, the station was generous enough to break into the news, Today Tonight and Home and Away to show live finals here.<br>?It was good coverage, no matter, especially with the mobi-cam scooting along the bottom of the pool showing the bubbles flying out of the competitors' bathers.<br>?Ian Thorpe, brilliant and composed at 15 - enough said.<br>Tennis from Sydney and Melbourne on Seven:<br>?Britain's Tim Henman could have had the good grace to win in Sydney after beating our heart-attack hero Pat Rafter in the semi-final. But all credit to Karol Kucera.<br>?It was good to hear Pam Shriver's energetic calling again, despite her irritating American pronunciation of semeye-final.<br>?In a week of young bloods - Thorpe at the swimming, Lleyton Hewitt and the Williams sisters - it took that cagey old drop-shotter Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to restore some pride in the old brigade. And she is only 26.<br>?Mark Philippoussis beat up Andre Agassi in Melbourne, but we had to wait through an awesome demolition of the Australian water polo team by Hungary to watch it.<br>One-day cricket on Nine:<br>?Ricky Ponting can catch and bat, but no one else seems capable of much, unless it is against those lowly New Zealanders.<br>We have weeks of top sport ahead too, including the Winter Olympics on Seven. Who can wait to see those northern hemisphere lunatics trying to kill themselves on the luge?<br></font></p>
