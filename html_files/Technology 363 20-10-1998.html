            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Australian political cyberscape is a pretty dry place.<br>We might have had an interesting Federal election just 17 days ago, but traces of wild debate on the World Wide Web are hard to find.<br>Both major combatants, the Liberal and Labor parties, have left their election sites exactly as they were on polling day, October 3.<br>The Liberals' official party page, as distinct from its election page, has not changed a jot. It operates as a place where Net users can find out about the party and join it.<br>Labor's home is being rebuilt for a relaunch, possibly incorporating the Java and latest technology that made its election page the snazziest, visually.<br>The National Party and the Democrats continue to use the Web as a supplementary information tool.<br>Pauline Hanson's One Nation page has come to a virtual halt with the addition of only one press release since the party's figurehead was dumped by the people of Blair.<br>The Web is not a major political weapon in this country. It is doubtful we will ever see its use for the mass release of a damning political document like the Starr report on Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky in the US.<br>Nor are we likely to hear of high-profile hackings such as the one carried out on the Indian Army's Kashmir pages last week.<br>The Kashmir pages which log - from an official Indian point of view - actions against Pakistani insurgents in the region, were replaced by reports of the alleged torture of Kashmiris by the Indian security forces.<br>The sabotage happened as India and Pakistan began talks in Islamabad to ease tensions.<br>We in Australia did see a political hacking during the election campaign. Two young ALP staff members lost their jobs for encouraging the hacking of the Liberal site.<br>But the alterations were undergraduate in comparison to the Kashmir episode. The Liberals' pages were altered to link to pornography sites and biographies were altered. Hardly international incident stuff.<br>The ?highlight? of the Web's contribution to campaign debate was fairly undergraduate too. Labor included two games, one that could be played online and the other that could be downloaded, as part of its interactive package.<br>Both are available at the campaign site. In the online one, called Creamfields, users are invited to try to hit Prime Minister John Howard with as many cream pies as possible. The other is Howard's End in which users must hit various targets - one is a Telstra for sale sign - that pop up around a cartoon figure of Mr Howard.<br>But what of the future when the Net is more a home necessity than luxury? Net campaigners Electronic Frontiers Australia recently analysed the major parties' Net policies.<br>The coalition and One Nation fared worst in the EFA's estimation, scoring only half the ratings the free-speech advocates gave to Labor, the Democrats and the Greens.<br>EFA board member Danny Yee described coalition policy on offensive and pornographic material as ?impractical? and ?highly illiberal?.<br>Mr Yee said that none of the parties had taken a bold stance in support of online liberties.<br>Do we take note and go on alert, or sit back and watch Mark Taylor?<br>For the time-being, a bit of both would not hurt.<br>HELP DESK<br>Australian Political Resources<br>plato.itsc.adfa.edu.au/apr/<br>Electronic Frontiers Australian<br>www.efa.org.au<br></font></p>
