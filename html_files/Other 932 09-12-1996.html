            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NOW that Michael Jackson has left our shores we can talk about him behind his back. Some call him weird, others say he is off the planet. Overall he is the moonwalking personification of the old phrase: ?It takes all types.?<br>But while the megastar American singer and dancer is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, there are a few Perth families who think he is one of the greatest guys they have met.<br>This is a no-names, no pack drill report, but comes from some very reliable sources around the city.<br>When hundreds of people packed every vantage point outside Jackson's hotel, some children were either squashed hopelessly or cut off from any chance of a view. Jackson, entering the hotel, noticed this and got his minders to give the kids a better look. He also asked for the children's addresses and phone numbers and whether they had been, or were planning, to see his concert (which from all reports was one of the showbusiness events of at least the decade).<br>After all the starmania at the hotel had cooled down and the children had gone home, Jackson reportedly took the time to ring the numbers he had been given personally. Each time - and I have heard there were at least two families concerned - he talked to the parents and the children for at least half an hour.<br>The upshot of the conversations was that Jackson sent a car to the homes of those he'd talked to, which then whisked the families to one of his concerts at Burswood, where the lucky recipients of his hospitality were given red-carpet treatment.<br>They had terrific seats, the kids were invited on stage to sing and dance with him, and then invited backstage where they ended up enjoying pizzas and more star treatment.<br>The children, aged between 8 and 11, reported that Jackson was a very friendly guy who just seemed to enjoy the company of kids. They used adjectives like ?terrific?, ?great? and the simple phrase, ?he's a really nice guy?. They also said he seemed genuinely interested in talking to them and, more importantly, listening to what they had to say.<br>One of the mothers was so taken with the megastar's kindness, that when Jackson was on the phone to her, she said she wished she could invite him round for tea.<br>He declined graciously, but said he would take the family for dinner - which he did. And a lovely night was had by all.<br>Other reports are of Jackson and minders at a suburban video shop, where he wanted to rent stacks of movies. He just wandered in, according to reports, and the shop owner wanted to give him privacy by shutting out the growing crowd of admirers.<br>But the Jackson team was more than happy to let the star mingle with the fans while he perused the shelves.<br>Autographs were signed and kids got to talk to him. The minders, rather than being stereotypical bouncer-types, were said to be helpful and pleasant to everyone.<br>???<br>90s CHRISTMAS: I spotted this among the rush of Christmas e-mail the other day. This is just the first two verses of a very modern Christmas poem.<br>Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck<br>How to live in a world that's politically correct?<br>His workers no longer would answer to ?Elves?.<br>?Vertically Challenged? they were calling themselves.<br>And labour conditions at the North Pole<br>Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.<br>Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<br>Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<br>And equal employment had made it quite clear<br>That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<br>So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<br>Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!<br></font></p>
