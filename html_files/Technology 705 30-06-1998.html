            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A DETAILED picture of WA's coastal environment is starting to take shape on the World Wide Web of the Internet.<br>A prototype of the Australian Coastal Atlas is on the Web now at both Environment Australia and the WA Land Information System (WALIS) sites.<br>What is there will not rock users' socks off yet. But within a few months expect big changes, both in form, which will be far more attractive and navigable; and content, which will reach from the depths of the sea to the inland.<br>WALIS is the coordinating body responsible for 27 WA agencies providing data to include on the atlas as part of the WA node of the project.<br>Computerisation of this data eventually will allow Net users to see layer on layer of detail about the coastal environment via a simple mouse click.<br>Categories of information going into the atlas include: base layers (the ocean floor, the coast), onshore coastal (wetlands, soil, land use), oceanographic (currents etc), water quality, climate, fisheries, marine biology, geoscience and socio-cultural (population, demographics).<br>It is a far-reaching exercise designed to provide information that can be used at levels as varied as the basics of geography for schoolchildren, to the minutia about the rock formations at sea for geologists, say.<br>Users will be able to select a stretch of any part of the coastline and generate maps which incorporate features including roads, wetlands, climate, population and preservation zones.<br>WA is leading the way in placing information on the atlas, according to the leader of the overall Australian project, Steve Blake of the Environment Resources Information Network.<br>It has the biggest marine and coastal data sets in Australia and a great deal of expertise in the area.<br>One of the big data contributors is the WA Department of Transport which has expertise in maritime cartography and spatial data management.<br>HELP DESK<br>www.walis.wa.gov.au/<br>marine/coastal-atlas<br>www.environment.gov.<br>au/marine/<br>coastal-atlas/index.html<br></font></p>
