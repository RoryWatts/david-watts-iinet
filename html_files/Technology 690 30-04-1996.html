            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SENSATIONAL is one way to describe Microsoft's latest version of FrontPage, a Web publisher and editor that should take the Internet community by storm.<br>Unfortunately, byte-chewing and resource-hungry are other ways to describe FrontPage.<br>But the pluses far outweigh the minuses in a program that, through aggressive marketing and almost insane pricing, looks like revolutionising Web site publication.<br>Not only that but FrontPage has the dubious potential to put a lot of small HTML editor programs out of work.<br>The highlights of FrontPage are a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) HTML editor and a Web site manager, making it possible for relative novices to manage mildly complex Web sites.<br>The ease of working with WYSIWYG HTML cannot be underestimated. It is reasonable to say that most of the 100 million or so Web pages on the Net today were created by people who laboriously coded their documents. Some would have had easy previewing abilities to check their work offline.<br>Now it will be possible with FrontPage and a small amount of HTML knowledge to turn out a Web page with graphics, tables, forms and even frames with startling ease.<br>As the user types, his or her work appears as it will on the Web. Images, forms and tables are added - not by painstaking code - but by pointing and clicking the toolbar and following the prompts.<br>And here is where FrontPage may horrify the purists. Practically every operation, from editing to managing Web sites, is done through menus. They can be boring at times compared with the freedom of free coding but they do produce consistent results.<br>It is possible after a few hours of learning for a HTML novice to produce a Web page in less than half the time it would take using a very good editor such as HotDog.<br>One of the outstanding features is the ability to paste in documents from Word or Notepad and not have to worry about coding in line breaks as with other editors.<br>The Web management function through FrontPage Explorer is harder to pick up. It has been designed with small Internet Service Providers or office intranet system managers in mind.<br>Microsoft boasts that FrontPage Explorer allows non-professionals to become Web managers without programming. It is true, but only with dedication and a bit of frustration coming to grips with the welter of menus and choices.<br>When that is overcome a would-be Web manager can create a Web site showing all his links. From there it is absurdly simple to update a link that may appear on many pages, simply by clicking on it once.<br>The biggest minus with FrontPage is that Microsoft recommends 12MB of RAM for Windows 95 users and 16MB for Windows NT. The compressed software before installation weighs in at 8MB. After installation it occupies 20MB of space.<br>FRONTPAGE was developed in version 1.0 by Vermeer Technologies in Redmond, Seattle, the home of Microsoft. Microsoft bought Vermeer three months ago and has developed version 1.1 and released the beta test software as freeware at its home page.<br>Version 1.0 used to cost more than $600. Microsoft plans to sell 1.1 for $149 and give MS Office 95 customers a $40 rebate. The full release is expected next month.<br>FrontPage is designed to fit in with the MS Office suite, including Word and Excel. All the somewhat chunky, overbearing toolbar items are there.<br>The US Internet guru Nicholas Negroponte believes a new Web page is being added to the Net every four seconds. FrontPage would appear to have the ability to make that one every two seconds by empowering users who might be afraid of hard code but are happy to work WYSIWYG.<br>Of course that means a lot of HTML could be written by people who haven't the faintest idea what they are doing. But it also means people can now publish without the barrier of acquiring what they perceive as an arcane skill.<br>The price of this democracy is that Microsoft grows fatter and wins one of the many Net battles it has been fighting.<br>URL: www.microsoft.com<br></font></p>
