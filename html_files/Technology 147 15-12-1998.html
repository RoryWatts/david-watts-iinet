            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Web offers its millions of users some different perspectives on Christmas.<br>The AOL free-offer CD discs that are becoming commonplace in letter boxes and stuck to magazines actually make fine gifts.<br>But not in the way AOL intended.<br>One enterprising Netizen called Nikki has turned them into jingle bell necklaces, angel candlestick holders, mobiles and a Nativity scene with CD-ROM halo.<br>You can order them online after browsing the wares at Nikki's AOL site.<br>Bill Clinton's affair of the smoking trousers with Monica Lewinsky has also spawned an original gift idea.<br>The Really Russian site is offering sets of hand-carved nesting dolls that have President Clinton as the main doll.<br>Inside the President is a slightly smaller Monica doll. Inside her is a Paula Jones doll, followed by a little Hillary Clinton doll, then a gold saxophone.<br>For the person who has everything, but isn't very happy about it, there is a ?demotivational? calendar from Despair Inc.<br>The company's products mimic corporate inspirational posters. The calendar recounts what it claims are pessimistic days in human history, such as August 24, 1995, the day Windows 95 made its debut.<br>If you have survived the traditional office party, the Xmas Office Party site wants you to tell the tale, especially if it is about the marketing boss lap-dancing on the office boy.<br>Last week no one had weighed in with their experiences, or pictures. Presumably people are waiting for the hangovers to clear.<br>Help Desk<br>AOL disc presents:<br>www.NeoSoft.com/nikki/<br>Really Russian (for Clinton dolls):<br>www.reallyrussian.com<br>Despair Inc:<br>www.despair.com<br>Xmas Office Party:<br>www.global-image.demon.co.uk/party/<br>Traditional Christmas sites (for music, screensavers, festive wallpaper, letters to Santa etc):<br>www.northpole4kids.com<br>www.santaland.com<br>www.claus.com<br></font></p>
