            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NEARLY 80,000 people were at the MCG on Friday night. At times it seemed half of them were in the Channel 7 commentary box.<br>Seven has football coverage sewn up for the foreseeable future, has a stake in Melbourne's new Docklands stadium and pumps resources like video highlights of matches into the AFL's web site on Internet.<br>It is important for the network to have its coverage rate well. Blue Heelers aside, the greatest game is Seven's greatest hope in winter duels with Channel 9.<br>It is obviously trying to find a formula that will sit well with the masses. But the secret to that formula does not appear to reside with a four-man commentary team in one box, a sometimes cold and lonely Peter McKenna in the Great Southern Stand, the mandatory boundary rider and sometimes a couple of injured players eating pies in the outer.<br>All that is overkill.<br>Last Friday night's effort at Collingwood's unexpected defeat of Richmond emphasised this.<br>Bruce McAvaney could talk the hind leg off a duck, and he did. But Tim Watson found far too many times when he thought it appropriate to give his expert opinion.<br>?Fourth umpire? John Russo is becoming as garrulous as McAvaney and also chipped in more times than was warranted.<br>All this left old-fashioned caller Ian Robertson little opportunity to actually call the action.<br>There is at least one talking head too many. The actual match seemed fairly entertaining, particularly with a rare show of form by the Rocca brothers - and Seven viewers will just have to take the surname for granted, because they are never called anything but Sav or Anthony.<br>But it was often hard to tell who was there to do the entertaining. McAvaney obviously thinks we want to know useless facts, like he saw someone's dad play in the South Australian league.<br>Russo may well have served his purpose by the end of the Ansett Cup, having explained the holding the ball rule, and what constitutes a mark. With him in the box, the commentary has become more umpire-centric than ever.<br>We now have to have every little over-the-shoulder or in-the-ribs niggle dissected and analysed.<br>Meanwhile, there are young blokes - the real entertainers - busting their lungs out on the park in a fury of action.<br>But if Seven persists with letting the chatter overflow and insists on lingering with the super slow-motion replays, then goals and other equally important ?live? incidents are going to be missed.<br>Why not leave one guy to call, alternating with the expert (a la cricket), and crawl all over the replays at the breaks - oh, I forgot, that's when the ads are on.<br>Why not query the umpiring by sending faxes to Russo for answer at a later date, preferably on the Footy Panel or Talking Footy?<br>Then we could all sit back and enjoy the game, and not have to bask in what Seven seems to think is its cleverness.<br></font></p>
