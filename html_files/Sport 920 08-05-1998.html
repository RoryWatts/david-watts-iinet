            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I HAVEN'T been feeling that well this week. So I went to a psychiatrist. Here is what transpired:<br>Psychiatrist (hereinafter referred to as P): Now tell me, what seems to be the problem?<br>Me (hereinafter referred to as Me): I think I'm becoming a West Aussie.<br>P: Now what could be the matter with that?<br>Me: Well you see I'm a Queenslander born and bred and proud of it . . . or so I thought.<br>P: Being a Queenslander is a serious illness you know.<br>Me: Yes but I've learnt to live with it or at least I thought I had.<br>P: That is good. Overcoming the Hanson/Bjelke-Petersen syndrome is difficult. But what makes you think it's all changed and you're a Sandgroper?<br>Me: Well I really believe Justin Langer is the victim of an eastern States conspiracy and should be in the Test team ahead of Elliott, Bevan or even Mark Waugh.<br>P: Ummm. Queenslanders are prone to conspiracy theories like that, too. Think of Peter Burge and Sam Trimble in the 60s. It might simply be displacement.<br>Me: But I think Brendon Julian should be there, too.<br>P: Still doesn't prove anything. Let's try a bit of word association. When I say a word, you respond with the first thing that comes to mind.<br>Sardines, Freo<br>Cappuccino, Freo<br>Exciting football, Freo<br>Fine wine, Margaret River.<br>Great sportsmen Dennis Lillee, Herb Elliott, Margaret Court, Polly Farmer, Shirley Strickland, Neil Brooks, Barry Cable . . .<br>P: That's enough. Very interesting. Name some of the greats of Australian showbusiness.<br>Me: Johnny Young, Baby John Burgess, Gary Carvolth, Lionel York . . .<br>P: Enough, enough. This is looking potentially serious. Let's try authors.<br>Me: Tim Winton, Elizabeth Jolley, David Malouf.<br>P: Ah, but Malouf is a Queenslander isn't he?<br>Me: But he writes like a West Australian.<br>Y<br>P: Okay, calm down. How about food? Play the word game again.<br>Fish, herring, caught off the jetty at Rottnest.<br>Fruit, apples from Donnybrook. Bananas from Carnarvon.<br>P: Tsk, tsk, a Banana-Bender too, we may be on to something.<br>Beef, prime Harvey fillet, grain-fed and tenderised, best accompanied by a peppery cab sav from the South-West or Pemberton if you're adventurous.<br>P: Well that might just prove you're reading too many menus or that bloke Jordan's wine column. Let's try some different associations.<br>Surf, Prevelly Park.<br>Holiday, Rotto.<br>Coastline, between Denmark and Walpole.<br>P: Have you been anywhere or seen anything else? What are you comparing these places with?<br>Me: I've been to New York, Paris, Rome, Dublin, Boston, Hawaii, all round Australia and I've lived in London.<br>P: What did you think while you were there?<br>Me: That I'd much rather be on a veranda facing an Indian Ocean sunset, which turns the light green grass a straw colour, while sipping a chardonnay, which is also a straw colour . . .<br>P: Dear me. You are exhibiting an awful lot of symptoms. What do you think finally alerted you to this West Australianness?<br>Me: At the WACA a couple of weeks ago I was watching the Eagles v Sydney. A great game, nip and tuck all the way. O'Loughlin from Sydney kicked a lovely goal that put them 20 points ahead with 10 minutes left.<br>P: So?<br>Me: I spat the dummy. I left the ground. We were going to lose. I couldn't bear it.<br>P: There, there. I don't want to push you as it's your first time on the couch. But how did you feel after Sunday's two-point loss to St Kilda?<br>Me: Loss, loss. That was never a loss. &%@** umpires robbed us. It was a moral victory I tell you. I agree with George. Those Easterners are out to get us.Richard Court is the greatest politician in the land and Eric Charlton is a genius. Tow icebergs to the Pilbara, build a great wall from Eucla to Kununurra. To arms, stop the Easterners. Secede . . .<br></font></p>
