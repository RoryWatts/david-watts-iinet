            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">In the age of the Internet, everyone can be a publisher. Family photos, poetry, resumes and humour - personal home pages and Web sites can be made up of any text or images that spring to mind. But how do you bring all these elements together in an orderly fashion, ready for the Web wide world to see? You can code HTML manually or take advantage of the numerous visual editors where building a Web page is as simple as point and click. DAVID WATTS weighs up some of the packages on offer.<br>If you think it's time you joined the throng and made your mark on the world with a personal Web site, heed this simple advice: Don't panic.<br>Yes, you have to learn a new language. It's called HTML or HyperText Markup Language. But it's not that difficult; in fact, it is fairly basic and intuitive. And if you don't want to know anything about it but still want a Web page, you can do it ? with some qualifications.<br>You can also forget what you may have read about frames, Extensible Markup Language, JavaScript or Cascading Style Sheets. You don't need them. In fact, if you have surfed the Web for a while you will know pages with these so-called enhancements can be a pain in the mouse.<br>Just KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), put your head down for a while and soon you could be reaping the satisfaction of creativity.<br>What you will need most is an HTML editor, in other words a piece of software that enables you to create HTM or HTML files that you can then upload to your Internet service provider's Web server (check first; not all Net access accounts give you Web space) so the whole Net world can admire your Web site (or home page).<br>The HTML editor market is fast becoming a bottomless pit. There are hundreds of them, most with funny names and nearly all with claims to get you on the Web fast and in good shape.<br>We will look at just a few of the popular ones in this step-by-step guide.<br>1: Learn HTML<br>The number of Web sites offering HTML tutorials matches the number of HTML editors. Access recommends one which embraces many of these and gives you the chance to download the entire tutorial as pages you can read offline with your browser at your leisure, thus doing away with the burden of printing out pages and pages, or trying to read in a hurry before the connection times out.<br>Web Tutor from Professional Web Design, enables users to learn basic HTML in nine easily followed chapters. You are encouraged to open a program like Windows Notepad - substitute SimpleText if on a Mac - and type along with the tutor.<br>Notepad? Yes, it is not pretty or stuffed with toolbars but it is probably the most effective HTML editor of them all and an ideal way to see what lies beneath a Web page.<br>Web Tutor's author Joe Barta puts it this way: ?First, if you have any of them fancy HTML editors and have an inkling to break "em in now ? forget it. The worst way to learn is to use one of those things. I know, I know, you got this 9Mb Wunder Wizzard that says it's gonna make putting up a Web page as easy as scratching your head.<br>?Just trust me on this one.?<br>Mr Barta is as good as his word and Web Tutor is a delight, not only for the novice, but Web page creators who need a refresher.<br>Mr Barta's comments are echoed in Australia by David Walker of The Age newspaper in Melbourne. His specialty is HTML and design and his pages at Lighthouse on the Web are an excellent resource for newbies and nerds alike.<br>Walker wrote recently: ?Writing Web code isn't as hard as it sounds. HTML has more in common with the mark-up notes scribbled on publishing copy. You can write it with a tool as simple as Windows Notepad.?<br>Not convinced? The alternative way to start is:<br>2: Look mum, no HTML at all<br>They are called Web Wizards. They are programs which enable people to create a Web page virtually by following a bouncing ball. There is seldom recourse to the actual HTML code being generated and therefore - depending on your point of view - no techno-stress or no understanding of what you are doing.<br>The prime example of a wizard is Sausage Software's HotDog Express, designed especially for novices in the hope they will stick with Sausage and one day graduate to the real world with HotDog Pro (see later) when they decide Web authoring is worth learning more about.<br>The following testimonial is on Sausage's site: ?I always wanted to get my own page on the Web but I just don't understand the technology, I don't even know what HTML is.?<br>HDE works with an almost childlike interface that enables the user to drag and drop so-called Web blocks to build a page. The blocks are clearly marked: heading, link, paragraph, image, etc. They can be shuffled in any order and a window appears to let the user input text or file information such as the URL of a site they want to link to.<br>It is simple but fairly inflexible because there is no code to fine-tune. It's a bit like a toy. And unless you register - making you liable for about $65 to buy the program - you will never see the real page, just a representation of it, never be allowed to upload it to the Web and never see the HTML code behind the page.<br>However, it obviously has its followers. Ziff Davis Publishing said of HDE: ?This is one Web-page editor you can't afford to do without. Made expressly for designing no-nonsense pages on the fly, HotDog Express is fast and foolproof.?<br>Other wizards of this ilk - but nowhere near as easy to use - include eVolution and LiquidFX Express. Netscape Composer has templates for easy page creation but does not pretend they are the beginning and end of authoring.<br>The next step is prettier and readily available:<br>3: For the more confident - WYSIWYG<br>WYSIWYG means What You See is What You Get. However, many who have dealt with these type of programs for years will usually add another letter: K for Kinda, so it is What You See is What You Kinda Get. That said, WYSIWYG editors have probably emboldened many people, who otherwise would have been scared of HTML coding, to create Web pages.It looks and often is quite simple: Start a document; type in the words; drag an image, and click on a toolbar button to add information about links and sources.<br>The downside is the rotten code that can result from constantly going over a WYSIWYG representation to try to get it right. A little HTML knowledge will enable users to fine-tune far more quickly.In fact, WYSIWYG editors enable you to edit the HTML code as well, synchronising the changes with the display, so it can be a good way to learn.<br>The daddy of commonly used WYSIWYG editors is Microsoft FrontPage. In its full release (the latest version is a beta of FP98), it can chew up more than 30Mb of hard disk space.<br>This is because its main intended function is as a Web server on which you can manage all your Web resources just as an Internet service provider would.<br>Trouble is, not every ISP supports FP's methods. So, especially for learners, this side of FP is a bit of a waste. It also costs more than $150.<br>But if you have Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 it may have, or you can easily download, FrontPage Express for free. This program has the HTML editor only and it is light and easy to use for anyone.<br>Strangely, for a product that seems more intended for a newbie, FP Express does a good job of repairing and updating old pages on the fly, so it is a reasonable tool for the more experienced as well.<br>So is Netscape Composer which comes free with the Communicator suite. It is faster to respond than FrontPage Express, does not have as many tools but is just as easy to use. Composer continues the tradition started with Navigator Gold 2.0 which included an editor with the browser for the first time last year.<br>It has improved considerably, although Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0 is fairly easy to create with too.<br>The WYSIWYG editor field grows regularly. The main problem with many is their size and the memory needed to run them. This is not surprising considering the grunt needed to show Web pages in construction.<br>Others of the genre worth a look are Adobe PageMill and Claris Home Page. Both require registration and payment and both feel a bit fiddly and less intuitive than Composer or FP. But that is the view of someone who came to them late. Claris Home Page 3.0 is due early in the new year but version 2.0 is bundled with the new ClarisWorks Office 5.0 suite. Now if you're feeling brave, you may like to look at the next stage:<br>4: All the code and more ?<br>Basic editing tools such as Notepad or SimpleText are fine if you have a tutorial on HTML handy or have a good memory. But it helps to be able to push a toolbar icon or click on a menu to create image sources or URL links. And there are dozens of editors that will let you do that and preview your work as you go.<br>Two of the best are Homesite and HotDog. Homesite is faster and lighter, HotDog is more rich in features and you should have 16Mb of memory if you want to make the most of it.<br>HotDog costs more than $150 while Homesite is only about $30 and there is a lighter freeware version too.<br>Both enable no-nonsense coding while showing previews in an easily accessed window.<br>These previews are nearly WYSIWYG and can be updated on the run. Both support new features such as Java applets and Style Sheets. Both can leave the user with the feeling of a job well done with their emphasis on getting the code right.<br>Many other products such as Arachnophilia require you to preview with your IE or Netscape browser which is launched separately.<br>This is no burden considering the lightness and simplicity of Arachnophilia especially.<br>In fact, this editor has a lot going for it because it is free. It also tucks away vital tools so they don't crowd your display window. Those tools - image editing, for example - are easy to get at and neatly labelled.<br>Next week: HTML editors for the experienced.<br>Here's one I made earlier<br>There's no time like now to give HTML a go. Follow these steps and you will have made a simple Web page.<br>1. Create a new folder or directory on your computer called HTML.<br>2. Open Notepad or SimpleText.<br>3. Type the following exactly (where is a return):<br>My page<br>Don't panic<br>it's as easy as HTML<br>When I want to learn HTML, I can always go to<br>HTML help<br>E-mail @ccess<br>4. Save As htm.htm and hit Enter.<br>5. Open your Web browser, go to File/Open, navigate your way to where you saved the file htm.htm and then open it.<br>6. There, you've done it.<br>Help desk<br>This list of HTML resources has also been written as a Web page and is available at www.iinet.net.au/ ~watto/<br>Web Tutor: junior.apk.net/ ~jbarta/tutor/makapage/index.html<br>Lighthouse on the Web: werple.net.au/ ~dwalker/front03.htm<br>HotDog Express: www.sausage.com.au<br>Microsoft Front Page: www.microsoft.com/australia/products/office/<br>frntpage/default.htm<br>Microsoft Internet Explorer (for FP Express): www.microsoft.com/ie/default.htm<br>Netscape (for Composer): home.netscape.com OR www.netscape.com.au<br>Adobe PageMill: www.adobe.com/prodindex/pagemill/overview.html<br>Claris Homepage: www.claris.com<br>Homesite: www.allaire.com/products<br>Arachnophilia: www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/<br>Dozens of editors: www.windows95.com/apps/html.html<br>Other resources: Carl Davis's editor reviews: www.techsmith.com/community/htmlrev/<br>index2.html<br>HotWired Webmonkey: www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/frontdoor/<br>nc_content.html<br>Barebones Guide to HTML: werbach.com/barebones/<br></font></p>
