            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Federal Government has been at the centre of a steady stream of online activity in the past fortnight.<br>Its Online Australia Day last month signalled the start of a daily outpouring of media releases and Net launches by the Department of Communications.<br>Initiatives have included:<br>?Farmwide's satellite-based trial providing 400 farmers with Net access via TV screens.<br>?The launch of the Commonwealth Government's Family Web site.<br>?Opening of three youth Net kiosks by ReachOut!, which will enable young people in remote areas to make use of an online counselling service.<br>?Net access and classes in more than 700 schools, libraries and community access centres.<br>?Provision of $19 million to improve Net and telecommunications services to regional communities.<br>Communications Minister Senator Richard Alston said last week he wanted the Government to ensure Australia's place as one of the world's leading users of the Net.<br>He quoted Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing that more than 1.2 million households had Net access in August - a 46 per cent increase since February.<br>?Nearly 4.2 million adults, or 32 per cent of the total adult population, accessed the Internet in the 12 months to August, and increasing numbers are using the Internet for electronic commerce,? Senator Alston said.<br>He pointed to the $250 million Networking the Nation program - funded by the part sale of Telstra - as a way of ensuring that people in rural areas benefited from the information explosion.<br>Evidence of the high level of Net activity came from community participation in Online Australia Day.<br>Senator Alston said the Online Australia site had attracted more than a million hits in its first week.<br>About 80 per cent of traffic was from domestic users and the rest from overseas. Of this, it was estimated 5 per cent of people visited the Australian Broadcasting Authority's Family Web site.<br>Senator Alston described the site as a vital tool for parents to help ensure their children were safe from damaging content while surfing the Web.<br>The site provides links to fun and educational sites, tips for parents about how to help children get the best out of the Net, information about how to find things online, explanations of the jargon to help parents, information about online risks to children and what to do about them, suggested house rules, and ideas for parents about how to support their children's education via the Net.<br>?The Federal Government will not tolerate the Internet being polluted by highly offensive or illegal material - whether it be pornography, bomb making menus or drug recipes,? Senator Alston said.<br>?However, there is only so much that governments can or should do. We can crack down on illegal activity, and we can work with the industry to minimise potential problems, but we can't replace the guardianship role of parents.?<br>Last Thursday Senator Alston announced 54 grants totalling $19 million, aimed at improving access in rural communities to telecommunications services.<br>The grants were also intended to improve infrastructure and provide training and other support.<br>The Rural Community Legal Service in WA was given $217,950 to test service delivery by providing video conferencing equipment in nine telecentres in the Wheatbelt.<br>HELP DESK<br>Department of Communications:<br>www.dca.gov.au<br>Online Australian Day:<br>www.onlineaustralia.net.au<br>Family Web:<br>www.onlineaustralia.net.au/ABA/<br></font></p>
