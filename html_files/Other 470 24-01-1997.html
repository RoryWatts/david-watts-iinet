            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE human race can do some stupid things. We are possibly not as stupid as krill, for example. Krill are tiny plankton whose whole rationale is to waft around cold oceans until they are devoured by the front-end loader of a whale's mouth.<br>Nor do we seem as stupid as amoeba. The amoeba has only one cell ... almost certainly not a brain cell ... and spends its life dividing. Thus the stupid amoeba constantly gives birth to another stupid amoeba, which gives birth to another, and so on.<br>Talk about in-breeding.<br>But humans have been pretty stupid since ancient times. Did you know those bastions of early civilisation, the Egyptians, used stones as pillows? The resulting insomnia drove them to invent hieroglyphics and leave a cryptic message for future generations. It probably was: ?Invest in duck feathers?.<br>This stupidity from such an advanced race of people did not die with them. It has multiplied with the ages and concentrates in every layer of modern society.<br>Stupidity comes in all shapes and sizes. There are teachers who tell children that poems must rhyme; florists who have been known to water artificial plants; airline staff who ask you to identify the size of lost luggage from a chart on which there are no dimensions; people who decree that apples must have little stickers on them to signify they are fruit; politicians who give money away without checking the bona-fides of those receiving it; anyone who believes Channel 7 was being democratic by hiring heavies to protect a story; and so on.<br>Thankfully, the English language has been adroit at keeping pace with stupidity. There are many ways to say someone or something is stupid.<br>One of my favourites is the very Australian, ?he's got kangaroos in the top paddock?. Others include ?one stubbie short of a six-pack?, ?a few Weeties short of breakfast?, ?the light's on but no one's home? ... these tell the same story in a much more friendly way than the blunt: ?You're stupid?.<br>Thanks to a regular correspondent - my mate Kevin, in Washington, DC - I have learnt several more descriptive ways of calling someone stupid. Here are a few:<br>The wheel's spinning, but the hamster's dead.<br>A few feathers short of a whole duck.<br>Warning: Objects in mirror are dumber than they appear.<br>Couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel.<br>An intellect rivalled only by that of garden tools.<br>As smart as bait.<br>Chimney's clogged.<br>Doesn't have all his dogs on one leash.<br>Doesn't know much, but leads the league in nostril hair.<br>His antenna doesn't pick up all the channels.<br>His belt doesn't go through all the loops.<br>Missing a few buttons on his remote control.<br>No wheat in the silo.<br>And to top it off, a new favourite: Strong, like bear ... smart, like tractor.<br>???<br>WHEN I was younger, two beauties in my home town used to delight in taking off their tops on very hot days. They would then drive into town, park outside a pub, and run bare-breasted across the road to the post office; then back again.<br>It kept the customers in the front bar quiet.<br>Now I read in The Times, London, that this sort of exhibitionism has reached epidemic proportions at, of all places, Disneyland in California.<br>Women on the Splash Mountain ride are flashing at security cameras filming the last 20m of the thrilling plunge.<br>The Times said that Disneyland was trying to stop the practice by stopping the ride when bare chests were seen and broadcasting a pre-recorded message: ?Please put your shirts back on. It's very unappealing, and frankly it's making me sick.?<br></font></p>
