            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ON THE surface there is not a lot to say about the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 Web browser.<br>Even Bill Gates reportedly was low-key about its launch, saying it was not a major upgrade.<br>But it does represent a slimming down of the version 4.0 browser. This is not necessarily in terms of size, but definitely in the way it now lets the user have more choice rather than imposing itself on the operating system.<br>Reviewers in the US suggest this toning down has a lot to do with the anti-trust case that charges Microsoft with unfairly trying to dominate the browser market by tying MSIE to the OS.<br>You can also say of version 5.0 that it is a bit faster, seems more reliable, has some nice new features, and still is an awful pain in the mouse to download and install.<br>Microsoft unleashed its new beast a week and a half ago and claimed that a million people downloaded it in the first seven days. It also said this was three times the number who downloaded MSIE 4.0 when it was released in 1997.<br>Interestingly, in 1997 it said that one million people had downloaded MSIE 4.0 in its first two days.<br>With figures like that, it is hard to get a steady bead on the sort of impact MSIE 5.0 will have.<br>However, the new StatMarket site reported last Thursday that MSIE 5.0 made up more than 5 per cent of the browser market already.<br>What might boost its share is the fact that it is faster and more reliable than version 4.0, and certainly more stable than Netscape's recent Communicator version 4.5.<br>West Computers has been using MSIE 5.0 since the day after its release and it has caused no trouble; not one browser-related hang or crash in a period when Communicator went down twice a day on average with exception faults.<br>This might look good for Microsoft, but it did come at a cost. Downloading MSIE 5.0 is not for the easily bored or angered. It took me four attempts and five hours overall to get MSIE 5.0 up and running.<br>The alternative is to install the browser from a CD-ROM ordered from Microsoft Australia. This choice means the ?free? browser costs $13.95. The other CD-ROM choice is to wait for a computer magazine to include it on one of those free disks you see stuck to the cover.<br>A routine MSIE 5.0 download is 17Mb and can tie up a user with a 28.8Kb modem for at least two hours. If an ISP is strict about kicking off users who have been connected for long periods, then the IE download can be chopped off at a crucial stage.<br>For example, one of my attempts ended with 99 per cent of the download complete.<br>But once MSIE 5.0 is installed, it is a worthy tool. This is especially so now that Microsoft has abandoned attempts to push users into its channels and the infuriating active desktop.<br>Though both puzzling utilities are still there, they can be ignored completely or configured like any other add-on.<br>The biggest new feature is the ability to turn on the radio any time while surfing the Web.<br>MSIE 5.0 has a radio toolbar from which users can select from a wide range of radio stations around the world. Choosing one will kick the Windows Media Player into action, allowing you to listen to anything from a rock station in Seattle to a Japanese talkback show.<br>A Microsoft page devoted to participating radio stations is included in the Favorites folder.<br>The next biggest new treat is one pioneered by Netscape Communicator 4.5. It is the ability to search for sites related to the one you are looking at in the browser window. Although it is early days, Microsoft's version appears to find more relevant sites than Netscape's.<br>The ability to organise Favorites has been improved by including the facility in the Favorites window pane, and also by adding to the dialogue options when Add to Favorites is clicked.<br>If a user mistypes a Web address, a new auto-correction feature in the updated browser often can fix the error automatically.<br>Microsoft has also added a variety of automated features in the new version, which makes it easier to revisit favourite sites, to fill out forms, and to conduct searches for information online.<br>Searching has been organised with buttons specifically for finding people, finding Web sites, finding news groups, finding maps and so on.<br>A ?next? button enables the user to cycle through different search engines if the first pass does not yield the desired results. A search button has even been added to the History list of previously-visited sites.<br>People who are happy with MSIE 4.0 may not find a lot to enthuse about by upgrading; and those who cannot abide big downloads should certainly look for another option.<br>But the bottom line is that MSIE 5.0 is a good browser which seems to have benefited by being beta tested for several months.<br>Download Internet Explorer 5: microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie5/default.asp - Or order on CD: www.microsoft.com/australia/windows/ie/offers/<br></font></p>
