            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It took the Australian Democrats Web site two days to admit Cheryl Kernot was no longer leader.<br>Her defection to the Labor Party last Wednesday might have put conventional media in a spin but political Web sites are still sleepy by comparison and at best a part-time pursuit of the parties. Neither the federal Liberal nor Labor party sites had any news of Ms Kernot's political change of heart either.The Democrats, easily the most switched-on party, made a curt reference to her fall from favour in the list of party MPs under the general information category.<br>The party simply said: ?For your information ? Cheryl Kernot, c/- Gareth Evans' Office, Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600.? This was on Friday afternoon. Until then, the list of MPs had remained untouched since February.<br>And Ms Kernot took pride of place at the head of the list with a long biography and photo.<br>On Friday, acting leader Senator Meg Lees usurped her place. The Parliamentary Library site still had Ms Kernot as an AD senator. It will change that, but her biography will still be in place and a must for those interested in the federal scene.<br>The AD site still has plenty about Ms Kernot too. People who like to indulge in a bit of retrospective wisdom will find her statements on the Easton royal commission's treatment of Carmen Lawrence fascinating.The Democrats have a good archive of speeches, media releases and parliamentary debates which have Ms Kernot's views on natural heritage, native title, pay-TV, the Telstra sale, political accountability and many other topics.<br>Her article at the Australian Republican Movement site is also worth reading for further insight into her views. Another perspective on Ms Kernot is available at Swinburne University Media, Film and Literature school in an article by female students called Toughing it Out in a Man's World.The students have written about the problems that face prominent women MPs such as Ms Kernot, Dr Lawrence, Bronwyn Bishop and former Victorian premier Joan Kirner.The Net's chattering classes in the aus.politics newsgroup are holding some fierce debates about the defection. People who often criticise newspaper headlines as too sensational have weighed in with subject headers such as ?Cheryl rats on the femocrats?, ?Cheryl is suckered?, and ?Kernot a Labor Stoge (sic)?.There are also calmer discussions under less emotional headings.<br>HELP DESK<br>Australian Democrats: www.democrats.org.au/<br>Parliamentary library: library.aph.gov.au/mps/mpindex.html<br>Kernot on the Easton commission: www.democrats.org.au/democrats/<br>parliament/old/ckeaston.htmlRepublicans: www.republic.org.au/<br>Swinburne Uni article: www.swin.edu.au/ssb/media/AM206/<br>am206b.htm<br>Newsgroup: aus.politics<br></font></p>
