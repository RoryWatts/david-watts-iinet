            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE question no longer is whether the Internet is useful, but what it is most useful for.<br>It cannot simply be viewed as a toy, although you can play and have fun on it.<br>It is not merely a place to perve on porn, but only fools would fail to acknowledge the sheer weight of naughtiness available.<br>And it is not just the domain of geeks who want to swap arcane source codes, or nerds who think it is a cool place to strut their latest networking knowledge. Of course it is more than a handy medium for both these pursuits.<br>But is any of the above useful in the everyday scheme of things?<br>As mundane as it may sound, the Net could soon become a useful place to do something as ordinary as pay bills.<br>Those who have used BPay telephone services know how dehumanising it is to be guided through the maze by a robotic voice.<br>You know the drill - If you know your name, hit 1; if you live in Perth, don't hang up.<br>All that to hand over your hard-earned to someone else.<br>Anyone who has performed BPay through an Internet banking service will appreciate the control and time given to the bill payer by comparison.<br>Unfortunately, not many companies offer BPay through online banks yet.<br>But, according to researchers www.consult, the tide is building for more reliance on e-billing, especially if we follow the US experience.<br>The researchers say 70 per cent of US households will pay bills electronically by 2009 compared with 4 per cent now. American utilities such as electricity companies, water companies and cable operators are expected to save $1.8 billion by using e-bills.<br>In Australia, the e-Bill company is about to launch an online payment system, while the Australian BPay Service uses its Web site to let consumers know the ins and outs of the procedure.<br>It is also developing an Internet billing and payment system, called Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP), which it expects to complete early next year.<br>The ABC has also latched on to the Net as a useful place.<br>Radio Australia is using a special Web site to provide comprehensive coverage of the historic vote for independence in East Timor next week.<br>Its site is in both English and Indonesian and is based on the success of the special site set up for the Indonesian election in June.<br>The ABC says the site will provide news updates in English and Indonesian; text, audio and pictures from reporters on the ground; profiles of key political figures, features, history and an interactive map.<br>Closer to home, Hollywood Private Hospital in Nedlands is using Net technology to introduce Web-based bookings for operating theatre times.<br>As soon as a booking is made from a surgeon's rooms, it is entered into the hospital theatre booking system.<br>The system also allows the doctor to print out the theatre list, anaesthetists' list and in-patient list. It is designed to cut the number of phone calls to theatre from the doctors' rooms.<br>Hollywood's information systems manager, Katerina Andronis, said last week the system would be simpler for the hospital because there would be fewer steps to book an operation.<br>HELP DESK<br>e-Bill company: www.e-bill.com.au<br>Australian BPAY Service: www.bpay.com.au<br>Radio Australia East Timor site: abc.net.au/news/etimor<br></font></p>
