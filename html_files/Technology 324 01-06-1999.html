            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">COMO Internet service provider Reynolds Technology director Mark Reynolds was as dismayed as most of his colleagues by the Federal Government's censorship legislation.<br>Like most smaller ISPs, he feels the regulation regime due to come into force next year will make Net access more expensive and slower while failing miserably in its aim to stop pornographic and violent content.<br>ISPs also fear that the imposition of ineffective blocking and filtering technology will force many of them out of business.<br>In the past month, since Communications Minister Richard Alston outlined the legislation, ISPs like Mr Reynolds have mounted a strong online protest. They have turned Web pages black, linked to long, technologically-literate arguments against censorship, and provided their customers with feedback forums to discuss the issue.<br>Mr Reynolds has gone several steps further than most.<br>In four days he set up a Web site called Project 1984, through which he arranged to send all 76 senators a copy of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. All copies of the book, with its potent message about governments dictating the thought patterns of citizens, made it to Canberra at the time the Senate was debating the legislation last week.<br>Mr Reynolds was devastated but not surprised that the Senate passed the legislation with the deciding votes of Independents Brian Harradine and Mal Colston.<br>Despite the vote, he says he hopes senators will read Nineteen Eighty-Four and digest the message about tampering with freedom of expression.<br>?All Australians should read this book again,? he said. ?From January 1 next year, the things described there will become reality in Australia.?<br>Mr Reynolds faxed each senator a message: ?This classic depicts life in a world where the state attempts to control the private communications and even thoughts of its citizens.<br>?The Online Services Bill is Orwellian in its implications. It has no place in a free society. It puts Australia out of step with other democracies and in the league of countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. The Internet is not pay television. It is the most participatory form of mass communication yet developed, a medium for the everyday personal communications of ordinary people.<br>?It should not be subject to classification and censorship any more than conversations, letters, faxes or telephone calls.?<br>Project 1984 came to life at noon on Friday, May 21, when Mr Reynolds posted a short suggestion to the Electronic Frontiers Australia online mailing list.<br>It said: ?There are 76 senators. What if 76 people or companies donated the price of one copy of the book Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, to be delivered to all 76 before next Thursday? (the original forecast date that the legislation would be debated).?<br>Mr Reynolds found contact details for the senators at the Australian Parliament House Web site.<br>Dymocks booksellers in Perth then helped him by tracking down and confirming that there were 80 copies of the book available in Melbourne, on a Friday afternoon. Special orders of this scale could be filled via e-mail.<br>Colleagues in the Net industry printed labels and envelopes and Mr Reynolds' sister, in Melbourne, arranged the pick-up and shipping of the novels.<br>The books arrived in time for the senators' first mail at Parliament House the next day.<br>?Using the Internet, the event was organised and funded in four days, over a single weekend. How could that protest have been effected that quickly without the Internet?? Mr Reynolds said.<br>The Project 1984 site lists all this feverish activity as well as donors who made it possible. It also includes full transcripts of responses that have been sent by senators.<br>Labor Senator Chris Schacht sent a copy of his speech opposing the legislation. In it he attacked the Government for ?having an obsession about the fact that new technologies may actually make it easier for some people to see something that is in bad taste or that does not fit their moral view of the world?.<br>He said that for every major technological breakthrough in the past 4000 years - writing, printing, faxes and now the Net - there had always been some anti-social activity.<br>?But if we had stopped each of those developments, modern civilisation as we know it would never have developed,? Senator Schacht said.<br>A Web page devoted to Friday's anti-censorship protest march through Perth came to life within 18 hours of the event.<br>Jason Jordan put together a page of comments and pictures and Kim Davies created one containing pictures of the rain-spattered protest by between 300 and 400 people.<br>Mr Jordan said his effort was a badly laid-out HTML disaster, but it won plaudits from dozens of users of the local newsgroup where he announced its creation.<br>Mr Jordan has a running commentary of the march and his thoughts about censorship next to 10 pictures taken by digital camera and scanned on to his PC after the march.<br>He wore a sticker that said ?censored? over his mouth during the march. He was called on to demonstrate how the Net would operate under censorship. He simply stood with the sticker over his mouth for a minute without talking and stared at the protest crowd.<br>Mr Jordan's page also criticises mainstream coverage of the issue, claiming that the media do not grasp how important it is.<br>Online coverage of protests in other capital cities is available at the Electronic Frontiers Australia Web site.<br>Project 1984:<br>www.rts.com.au/1984/<br>Jason Jordan's page:<br>www.omen.com.au/~pcguru/rally.html<br>EFA page:<br>www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/may28/<br></font></p>
