            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE World Wide Web has undergone a boring transformation in the past 12 months. Its main entry sites now all look the same.<br>The practice of creating portal sites - or windows to the Web - has resulted in many big sites looking like the pioneer search engine Yahoo.<br>Many portal sites are the homes of search engines too. If you open Excite, Lycos, AltaVista and Yahoo in different windows, the main difference will be the identifying logo on screen. The same goes for Netscape's Netcenter.<br>Net critics put this portal-mania down to a combination of factors caused by the continued maturing of the medium.<br>David Walker, maintainer of Lighthouse on the Web, an excellent Australian resource dedicated to Web design, said in early December that in 1998 more and more sites adjusted their technology to the needs of an installed base of two-year-old browsers and 33K connections. ?The Yahoo look, with its text-based navigation and clear hierarchies, is taking over,? he said.<br>He predicted a possible backlash against the pared-back, low-graphics look, ?if only because the slew of Yahoo mimics will realise they've made themselves utterly unmemorable?.<br>Scott Rosenberg of Salon Magazine recently attacked Disney for launching its own portal called Go.com. ?Just what the world needs: another Web site that unites directory listings, news, weather, stock quotes, movie reviews, free e-mail, shopping and other online functions on one ugly-as-sin Web page - one that looks and behaves remarkably like its popular competitors,? he said.<br>A perception that search sites have moved away from their main function of helping people find information, to driving those same people to sites where they can shop online, was given credence by a ZDNet summary earlier in the year.<br>Aaron Goldberg, an executive of a market intelligence firm in the US, told the major Web publisher what portals needed to do to succeed. He claimed a survey of 4000 users had shown that portals did a reasonable job of offering the things people said they liked to do - e-mail, reading online publications and downloading software.<br>But it was not enough. Most surfers were not online for general interest and wanted to find sites peculiar to very individual interests.<br>The future for portals revolved around e-commerce. They had to expand their shopping services. ?This means more than just pure advertising - it means beefing up their ability to offer pricing, availability and information,? Mr Goldberg said.<br>HELP DESK<br>Search sites: www.iinet.net.au/~watto/index1.<br>html#search<br>Lighthouse on the Web: www.shorewalker.<br>com/<br>contents.html<br>Salon: www.salonmagazine.com<br></font></p>
