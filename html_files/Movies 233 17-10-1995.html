            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CAN Hieronymous Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Hummpe and Find True Happiness? Who cares.<br>This 1969 movie directed by Anthony Newley and starring then-wife Joan Collins is, as Roy and HG would say "a joke, a disgrace'.<br>Prolific film reviewer Leonard Maltin gives the mildly tittilating (for pubescent youths) lemon a 1.5 out of five-star rating in Microsoft's Cinemania 94 CD. The Internet Movie Database doesn't even give it a rating.<br>The reason, certainly, is that the movie database is interactive. Rather than relying on a pundit for his or her views of movies, it relies on World Wide Web ?mouse potatoes? to vote and mail in their ratings on a 1 to 10 scale.<br>If there are sufficient votes to give an average score, then the rating is published.<br>Along with ratings there are complete lists of cast and crew with links to filmographies and biographies for most.<br>So, for the current blockbuster Apollo 13 the Internet movie buff is able to discover that Kathryn Blondell, appropriately enough, was responsible for hairstyles. If being that trivial is far too trivial then you can follow the links from Tom Hanks, the star, and peruse his list of lead roles ... and find out who was responsible for his hairstyles.<br>Searching the movie database is a thing of beauty and ease - URL: http://ballet.cit.gu.edu.au/Movies/<br>There are 25 categories from the title, actors' names to soundtracks, plot summaries and even the bottom 100 films. All this is free with the data base, managed and updated voluntarily in several countries, including Australia, by a team of film addicts and contributions from Net buffs.<br>Col Needham, who coordinates the database from Cardiff, Wales, says the project began in 1989 ?when someone started a discussion in rec.arts.movies about who were the most attractive looking actresses around?.<br>Over the next six years this simple question has expanded to the point where details of more than 52,000 movies with over 720,000 filmography entries are available.<br>Dedicated film addicts can download the database and have their own film trivia library, provided they have at least 20Mb spare.<br>But the best part is voting for films and then checking to see what the rest of the Internet world thinks.<br>If you give Casablanca a 4 out of 10, you might rightfully believe that your tastes are different to the 560 people who have given it an average score of 8.5. When I go to a movie with friends I always ask them what score out of 10 they rate the show we have just seen, so that I can go home, click on Netscape, and enter whatever score I feel like.<br>Democracy's like that.<br>Comments and suggestions to watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
