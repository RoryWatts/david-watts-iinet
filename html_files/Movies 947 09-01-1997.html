            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE CRITICS:<br>Mark Naglazas (MN), Helen Crompton (HC), Derry McCarthy (DM), James Mairata (JM*), David Watts (DW), John Anderson (JA), Jack Matthews (JM), Kenneth Turan (KT)<br>NEW RELEASES<br>HARRIET THE SPY ? ? ?<br>?I want to replicate my own DNA and win the Nobel Prize!? shouts Janie (Vanessa Lee Chester), an 11-year-old prodigy in combustible science. ?I want to play more baseball games than Cal Ripken jun and get filthy rich doing it!? exults Sport (Gregory Smith), who's no dope either. And Harriet? ?I want to see the whole world and write everything down!? As a symbol of art in general and writers in particular, the heroine of Harriet the Spy, the long-awaited film version of Louise Fitzhugh's celebrated novel, is an appropriate mix of the improbable and the impractical. And, as played by the sassy young Michelle Trachtenberg, she's just about irresistible. She spends her afternoons writing down everything she sees and adding her own rather caustic observations about classmates and acquaintances (which we hear in voice-over). She's a pint-sized Proust, a juvenile Joseph Mitchell. But when the book is taken and read to her classmates by the insufferably haughty Marion Hawthorne (Charlotte Sullivan), Harriet's words come back to haunt her. Although slap-happy with the kinds of music-video techniques intended for kids with no attention spans, Harriet the Spy is actually a smart-kid movie, with big lessons and even some subtlety. It's fun but isn't afraid to expose the overall nastiness of youth or the off-handed cruelty of one girl's ego. This is not a happy little movie about the sweetness of childhood; its PG rating is well deserved. Kids should certainly exercise judgment before letting their impressionable parents see it. Rated PG (JA)<br>HIGH SCHOOL HIGH ? ?<br>It wouldn't be fair to say that High School High uses up all its creativity in its title but it wouldn't be that far from the truth either. Starting with a hieroglyphic accompanied by a note explaining that it symbolises ?the producer formerly known as David Zucker?, High School High has an opening five minutes characterised by the kind of rapid-fire parody humour that made Zucker's reputation when he and his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams came up with Airplane! But not only doesn't the comedy last, it apparently went away because Zucker and his current team thought they had a better idea. The film's original idea was to spoof old movies about the high school experience, at a certain point writers Zucker, Robert LoCash and Pat Proft decided to be somewhat reality-based and focus more on character and story. It was not an inspired decision. What resulted is a feeble, time-wasting scenario, poking mild fun at Stand and Deliver and Dangerous Minds, about the attempt to get kids to learn. Hart Bochner's direction does not neglect the humour in these situations but the laugh lines are mostly crude and the prevalent slapstick is weak and uneventful. Most amusing are the film parodies that get thrown in, take-offs on motion pictures like Deer Hunter and Rebel Without a Cause. Perhaps that original parody idea was abandoned a little too soon. Rated M (KT)<br>THAT THING YOU DO! ? ? ?<br>Remember The Committments? The guts, the Guinness, the raw soul, the rough hilarity? Well this is nothing like it. Here we have good clean fun, 50s-60s US-style, which translates into natty haircuts, organically shaped TVs, lots of eyeliner, pastel colours and kitsch a-plenty. Oh yes, and four likely lads who graduate their band from the proverbial dad's garage to the stage. Don't give up after the first, slow 20 minutes when you think you've got it all sussed - it does pick up. Tom Everett Scott is a young Tom Hanks lookalike who plays the drummer ?hero? (Hanks writes, directs, acts and has even contributed a couple of songs to this) who travels from his family appliance store in Pennsylvania to a rock'n'roll tour which looks set to make the lads - The Wonders - the next Beatles. Liv Tyler plays someone's girlfriend and has some unfortunately wet lines. There's just about enough teenage screaming and general adulation to make this up-beat. And though it's pretty silly, you can't help smiling in parts. Must be something to do with what apparently passed for sexy in 1964. Rated G. (HC)<br>THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS ? ?<br>What comes from a genuinely true tale of terror, tingling with eeriness and fraught with nerve-stretching anticiaption? Hardly anything. And why? Because the characters are flat as a tack and the truly exotic setting - Africa at the turn of the century - is somehow almost absurdly gratuitous. Plot: Val Kilmer is John Patterson, Irish engineer, who starts out from London (with the worst Irish accent but it does get better) with the brief to build Britain a bridge at Tsavo, for the East African Railway. Tsavo means Place of Slaughter in Swahili and it soon lives up to its name with workers being taken off and eaten in the middle of the night. The problem? Man-eating lions. Enter the scarred face of Remington (too close a shave?) aka Michael Douglas, who supposedly eats lions for brekky instead of the other way round. The big white hunter (who arrives with a whole bunch of amazing looking Massai - but they lope off into the bush smart quick) is cynical about the blood-soaked tales he hears. He is soon to learn a horrible truth. It's a pity that this amazing tale (wait until you learn how many victims the lions chalk up) isn't ten times better than this. Rated R. (HC)<br>FESTIVAL OF PERTH DINKUS<br>L'AMORE MOLESTO ? ? ? ?<br>When her mother's body is found washed up on a beach, Delia travels to Naples in search of answers. Was it murder or suicide? Who was the strange man her mother was having an affair with and who was she with the night she died? What is most intriguing about this low-key Italian thriller is the way all of the answers reveal themselves as Delia begins to explore her own troubled childhood and past relationship with her mother. Set amidst an overcrowded and polluted Naples and with numerous flashbacks, writer/director Mario Martone (Death of a Neapolitan Mathematician) has created an extraordinary film filled with a sense of foreboding that will hold you until a final revelation that is both shocking and liberating for the central character. A uniquely plotted and elaborately structured film. L'Amore Molesto begins at the Somerville Auditorium on Monday. Rated M (JM*)<br>COLD FEVER ? ? ?<br>?This is a very strange place,? sighs the weary hero of this wacky Icelandic variation on the road movie. While travelling from Tokyo to the site of his parent's death near a remote Icelandic river, a young Japanese executive encounters a host of bizarre characters, including a funeral groupie, a bumbling pair of American crooks, a rowdy group of Icelandic cowboys and a helpful ghost. If you don't mind a central character who never develops beyond a constant state of bewilderment and an off-beat soundtrack that tends to grate after a while, Cold Fever is a cool distraction on a warm summer's eve. Cold Fever continues at the Somerville Auditorium until Sunday. Rated M. (JM*)<br>THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES ? ?<br>Barbra Streisand's lavish, self-serving romantic comedy is such a vanity piece it might well have been called The Face Has Two Mirrors. Streisand's Rose is supposed to be an ugly duckling that no decent man would want. Yet she's so damned sexy and intelligent when lecturing on romantic love that every student in the packed hall looks on her adoringly. Why then would such an impressive, self-assured woman agree to marry a nerdy, though nice-looking maths professor (Jeff Bridges) and spend months hoping he might climb into her bed? What carries the film is the snappy dialogue from that fine writer Richard LaGravanese (The Fisher King, The Bridges of Madison County). But in the end, even he can't iron out the film's annoying contradictions. Rated M. (MN)<br>THE GLIMMER MAN ? ?<br>The title of this routine action thriller refers to the amazing stealth of Steven Seagal's character, a former CIA agent named Jack Cole. Actually glimmer, which means to emit a dim or intermittent light, is a more appropriate description of Seagal's performance than his character's cunning. He plays a Mao jacket-wearing, multilingual, Buddhist Los Angeles police detective who suspends his religious aversion to violence after his wife is killed, throat-cutting and karate-chopping his way through a thicket of Russian and CIA henchmen involved in illegal arms. Keenen Ivory Wayans, as Cole's partner, attempts to add some of missing humour - but only if you think a recurring joke about a Chinese potion of powdered deer penis is funny. Rated MA. (JM)<br>A VERY BRADY SEQUEL ? ? ?<br>Still frighteningly cheerful, still as out of place in 90s California as alien invaders, the ?decade-impaired? Brady family makes its second big-screen appearance. While the new film is pleasantly similar to its successful predecessor, it does have a few new ideas, starting with the arrival of Carol's long-lost and presumed-dead first husband, Roy. In a goofy way, it liberates Greg and Marcia from thinking of each other as brother and sister and the mutual crush that takes place is the funniest part of a film that trades heavily on good-humoured sexual innuendo. Not surprisingly, the film runs out of steam before the 90-minute mark. But at those daft moments when the entire family bursts into inappropriate song, ruefully shaking your head and singing along seems like the only sane option. Rated PG. (KT)<br>CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION ? ? ? Australian writer-director Peter Duncan's mock epic black comedy has Judy Davis as an ardent communist who loves Stalin too much. Shine's Geoffrey Rush is her long-suffering comrade. M. (HC)<br>DAYLIGHT ? ? Sly Stallone's surprisingly humane, entertaining, old-fashioned disaster epic in the mould of The Poseiden Adventure. M. (MN)<br>Still on<br>DRAGONHEART ?? Smart special effects plus Dennis Quaid, David Thewlis, a rare appearance by Julie Christie and Sean Connery as the voice of the computer-generated Draco the Dragon. Daft, disarming and overall, medium-sized fun for kids. M. (HC)<br>FLY AWAY HOME ? ? ? Sculptor Thomas Alden (Jeff Daniels) and his 12-year-old daughter Amy (Anna Paquin of The Piano) herd geese from Canada to North Carolina. PG. (JM)<br>HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF ? ? Chock-full of chivalry, romance and adventures with tight corners for pretty musketeer Olivier Martinez and damsel Juliette Binoche. M. (HC)<br>JACK ? ? Sappy, soft-centred Big-like tale about a boy trapped in a man's body says much about director Francis Ford Coppola. PG. (MN)<br>MICHAEL COLLINS ? ? ? ? Sharp script and powerful images tell the compelling story of a gifted and courageous Irishman who virtually invented guerilla warfare as a means of countering the military superiority of Britain. Liam Neeson gives an incandescent performance. M. (DM)<br>NAPOLEON ? ? Low-tech Australian-made adventure about a cute golden retriever pup named Muffin (voiced by Jamie Croft). G. (MN)<br>101 DALMATIANS ? ? Tedious remake of the much-loved 1961 Disney animated feature. Glenn Close is Cruella De Vil. G. (MN)<br>SPACE JAM ? ? Over-loud, frenetic mix of animation and real life has Bugs Bunny enlisting basketball legend Michael Jordan's support to save Looney Tunes mates from life in an alien theme park. G. (DW)<br>ROMEO AND JULIET ? ? ? Baz Luhrmann mixes action movie gimmickry with the high camp of his theatre.<br></font></p>
