            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Flipper (PG)<br>Paul Hogan, Elijah Wood<br>Directed by Alan Shapiro<br>FLIPPER is mildly entertaining family viewing that barely keeps its head above water. In fact it is best with its head under water when the dolphins take over.<br>Our own Paul Hogan stars and he's not half bad ... which also means he's not half good. ?Hoges? is good when he is his old, relaxed, easy-going self. He is bad when he tries to be a tough guy. His much publicised facelift appears to have removed the crinkles and cheeky wrinkles that used to allow viewers to see his tongue planted firmly in his cheek when he went feral.<br>Now there are no such luxuries.<br>Flipper is a remake of a 1963 film that spawned a successful television series with one of the most annoyingly catchy theme tunes invented. If you listen closely you'll hear the magic words ?Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning. No one you see is faster than he.? This time they have been nicely jazzed up.<br>The story is so predictable it is surprising it got this far but then Hollywood does not like surprises when it is trying to make millions out of the school holiday traffic at the cinema.<br>Sandy Ricks (Elijah Wood) is a teen from a broken home sent to a tropical island off Florida to spend summer with his beachcomber uncle Porter (Hogan).<br>It is hate at first sight. Sandy is a streetwise, mall-lounging city kid with a permanent scowl, while Porter is the ultimate bachelor fisherman who lives in squalor and makes toast by applying a blowtorch to bread.<br>Why do we know these two are going to get along famously in the end after lots of tedious homespun philosophy?<br>Flipper - the real star - befriends Sandy after the dolphin pod is wiped out by a no-good charter boat operator, Dick Moran (Jonathon Banks), who wants the dolphins away from his fish.<br>The relationship between Sandy and Flipper is touching and slightly unreal, but helps move the film along.<br>Flipper is not allowed to be a pet in a fishing community, however, and Sheriff Buck Cowan (an awful portrayal by soul singer Isaac Hayes) splits the happy family.<br>But Flipper to the rescue. He reveals that bad guy Moran is an environmental criminal and boy, uncle, dolphin and assorted girlfriends (Chelsea Field and Jessica Wesson) paddle to the rescue.<br>The truly amazing bit about this rescue is that Field as marine biologist and store owner Cathy Simms somehow has the most advanced computer tracking gear just hanging about her shop to help with the mission to uncover Moran's wrongdoing.<br>You get the picture? It is harmless school holiday fun that doesn't stand close examination.<br>The underwater scenes with the dolphins and a frightening hammerhead shark are well worth seeing as are the dolphin dances set against a setting sun.<br>? Flipper opens on Thursday.<br></font></p>
