            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Quebec separatist vote inflamed passions of correspondents on the Internet ... but instead of a Quebec versus Canada argument, guns were turned on a common enemy, the US.<br>In the newsgroup soc.culture.quebec - a bulletin board where more effete matters are discussed normally - American correspondents baited Quebeckers by telling them a ?yes? vote would ensure they became a civilised country like the US.<br>The response north of the Great Lakes was typified by this: ?There is so much violence and hatred between racist groups that the USA might as well still be in a civil war.<br>?The quality of life there sucks. Americans are so ignorant that they can't even hang another nation's flag right side up.<br>?The USA is nothing but a bully to other nations and to its own people. America is the most selfish and cocky country on the planet.?<br>The battle went further.<br>American: It's our American-based computer manufacturers, our American-created Internet and our American sense of freedom that keeps us strong.<br>Canadian: There are many things that make America strong, but cocky cretins with a very tenuous grasp of history and current affairs don't make the list.<br>Proponents of the ?no? vote were often emotional as they argued to keep Canada one nation.<br>?No more shall our family be divided. Quebec is our sister province.?<br>Elsewhere on the Net, CNN not only broke news of the vote regularly to World Wide Web browsers, it also offered room for feedback and presented the Quebec Parliament's Separation Bill.<br>Emotion might have run high among correspondents but it was nothing compared with the preamble to the Quebec Declaration of Sovereignty carried by CNN.<br>?The time has come at last to harvest what has been sown for us by four hundred years of men and women and courage, rooted in the soil and now returned to it,? it said.<br></font></p>
