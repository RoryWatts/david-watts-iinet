            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Living with Parents<br>Family and Children's Services of WA has created an excellent site in both form and content to help teenagers - and their parents - cope with what can be a troubled time growing out of childhood into adulthood. You can choose a Macromedia Flash version of the main page, or opt for the simpler version, but whichever you choose will lead to straightforward, common-sense advice using a colourful, well-illustrated format.<br>There are 10 topics for advice, discussion and occasionally feedback in the form of questionnaires. Categories include Being a Teenager, Understanding Your Parents, Talking with Parents, Give and Take, and Time together and apart.<br>Some sections use case studies to show that perceived problems between teens and parents can be overcome by trust and talking. (DW)<br>Western Warriors<br>You won't find why Justin Langer is not in the Test side instead of Mark Waugh here. Nor is there anything about the current state of the WACA pitch. But the official page of the State Sheffield Shield side does include profiles and pictures of the players in the squad with those vital statistics of which cricket lovers are so fond.<br>Results from all last season's matches are easy to find, including the surprising loss to Queensland in the Shield final. A schedule of this season's games will show results of any played. There is also a long report of how the Western Warriors came to be in 1994-95 and the type of marketing and sponsorship required in big sport these days, plus a small but impressive collection of links to other major cricket sites. (DW)<br>Ghost Sites of the Web<br>This site is a sublime tribute to one of the most ubiquitous phenomena of the Web - dead sites.<br>Steve Baldwin, creator of Ghost Sites, even goes as far as giving the dead sites a ?ghost? rating, with extra points being awarded for particularly inert Web pages. An example - the 48th Cannes International Film Festival site of 1995 scores well for entreating users to ?check back for daily updates?. For a site that hasn't been touched for two years, that's pretty cheeky.<br>Mr Baldwin's writing is good and his wit is penetrating - heaven help those who would leave a pretentious site to rot in the backwaters of the Web. It will not escape his notice.<br>Ghost Sites rejoices in the decrepit and above all, relishes the irony of dead links in the supposedly hyper-connected world of the Web. The Net needs more of this kind of intelligence. (HC)<br>The Independent<br>The Independent newspaper is still the new kid on the block in what used to be called Fleet Street. But it is a paper of the highest quality which has shaken Britain's established press since it was launched in 1986. In the real world, it competes with such great institutions as the Times, Daily Telegraph and Guardian. And so it is on the Web too.<br>Unlike the Times or Telegraph, the Independent does not bring the entire paper online. Unlike the Guardian, it does not concentrate on a unique cyber-edition, dealing with special issues only. It is a blend, offering the main stories daily in a simple, easy-to-use format. (DW)<br>NoizeNet<br>For the lazy among us who prefer to let our fingers walk across the keyboard than to drag our feet across town, a new online CD store may take one stop out of the endless Christmas shop.<br>NoizeNet, which promises ?music for your ears, right before your eyes?, offers free shipping of CDs within Australia. Its main page has a summary of new titles and those available for advance ordering, an album of the week (last week it was The Cure's Galore) and a selection of featured albums.There's also a list of the top 40 CDs and a music quiz where users can win $500 worth of CDs. We managed to find a selection of titles ranging from mainstream acts such as Celine Dion and Bryan Adams to more indie acts such as Joy Division, Pavement and Blur.Shoppers can opt for a secure transaction using the SSL protocol, an insecure transaction or a phone/fax order. The local Web site is the virtual incarnation of Victoria Park record store Innerspin Compact Discs. (SY)<br>City of Perth International Tattoo Web Site<br>Pomp, ceremony, colour, tradition and fun for all the family is promised by the the City of Perth International Tattoo, which has its inaugural performances in the Supreme Court Gardens each evening from November 26 to 29.<br>A visit to the Tattoo's colourful and comprehensive Web site is very informative. Here you will learn the smoke-free event aims to bring together the ANZAC Spirit and the youth of today, ?in a festival of ceremony, music, dance, field display, horsemanship and other staged events?.<br>The Tattoo unfolds a story of fantasy - good over evil - encompassing romance and chivalry characteristic of medieval times. There will be performances from the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Logistic Corp Band, the Hong Kong Police Pipe Band, the New Zealand Lochiel Champion Marching Team, the Sbandieratori Flag Throwers from Italy.Local participants include members of the the defence forces, police, cadet forces and community bands.The event is presented by the Returned and Services League of WA. The site also has a number of links to other Web sites containing military and medieval information. (SY)<br>Hahn Ice<br>Being a non drinker and rather blase about Web sites that are so blatantly consumer product-related, I entered this site with some trepidation. What I found was an entertaining lifestyle site complete with its own interactive game, an iChat room called the Pump Room, and, most impressively, a list of lifestyle-related links.<br>These are broken up into the areas of sport, movies, travel, fashion, movies and print - and with the latter area offering suggestions from The Age and BRW to Amazon and HotWired, it should provide a useful springboard for new and more jaded surfers from all walks of life.<br>One of the objectives of the Hahn site is to ?help you get the best out of your leisure time, online and off?. Thankfully, this doesn't mean you need a stubby in your hand as you browse. But if you really are interested in beer, then there's a history of the brewery, a virtual tour and merchandise information to keep you happy.And, if you're ever in need of a joke, follow the link to Punchline. But be warned - there are plenty of tasteless ones in this repository.
