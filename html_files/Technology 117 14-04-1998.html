            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The coward's way out of the browser war between Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator/Communicator is to run both. It might sound messy, but if you have enough disk space, RAM, processing power, and are reasonably well organised, it gives you the best of both worlds.<br>Of course, it could be twice the trouble, in which case another way out of committing to the big brands is to opt for neither and install something fast and light like Opera.<br>But back to the big two. You will need some tools to ensure you can keep track of your Netscape Bookmarks and Explorer Favorites (Netscape has certainly stolen Microsoft's thunder in this department ... ever heard of anyone wanting to ?favorite? a page?).<br>The simplest program that does this is Bookmark Converter 2.0, a light and fast piece of shareware that will convert either way with none of the fuss involved in many other bookmark utilities available on the Web.<br>You will also need to keep track of e-mail. Explorer is a bit of a bully here. Its e-mail and address book files are in a proprietory language, so it is very hard to convert either into Netscape-readable format. Explorer's Outlook mail can import all sorts of mail and address formats, so it might be the mail program of choice ... purely through lack of choice.<br>The newest Communicator 4.05 includes a program that will convert Eudora mail to Netscape format, and it might not be a bad idea to make Eudora your default mailer, and thus have the ability to import its messages into both browser platforms.<br>Communicator and Explorer both have WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editors that are easy to use, but produce slightly different raw hyper text code. Indeed both companies are guilty of launching new standards of HTML so that some pages - written with style sheets and/or layers, for example - cannot be read by the competing browser.<br>This, then, is another area where a third party such as Homesite, an excellent HTML editor, might be preferable to the giants' tools.Many Web surfers might feel they have no choice in selecting a browser. New PCs with Windows 95 already have Explorer 3.0. Windows 98 will be released in two months and Internet Explorer 4.0 will be the common user interface. It will not simply be a Web browser, but the tool used to examine the entire operating system shell.<br>Win 95 users with Explorer 4.0 know that already. Some like the way Explorer takes over; others are affronted, fearing another Microsoft takeover is ruining their freedom to run their system the way they want to.<br>(The difference between Win 95 with Explorer 4.0 and Win 98, by the way, is that Win 98 is faster, smoother and more stable, judging by the public-release beta I installed recently). Netscape helped make the World Wide Web the attractive and interesting whirlpool of information that it is today. Microsoft merely piggy-backed on the revolutionary graphic browser's breakthroughs before finally coming up with something to match it.That was in September 1996, nearly two years after Netscape blazed the trail that allowed ordinary computer users to join the Internet revolution by surfing the hyper links. Netscape has developed a brand loyalty evident in discussions in many newsgroups. As a little upstart company, it gripped the imagination of the fledgling Net community.<br>Microsoft is often seen as the big, bad wolf in all this. And personally, I am not surprised. It is a big corporation with many times the staff and resources of Netscape and a much greater margin for error because it dominates, with 87 per cent, the personal computer operating system market.<br>But, with both Explorer 3.0 and 4.0, it has a good product. In fact, very little separates the browsers now.To put it a bit cynically, they both seem to crash as often as each other. But putting that aside, there is no reason to give Microsoft a free kick in the browser war, nor to feel obliged to Netscape even if you suspect Microsoft might have something better.<br>And thank goodness this is a war between software that can be run on the same computer, even at the same time with the right resources.<br>If you were back in the days of Holden v Falcon, wouldn't it have been great to drive both at once?<br></font></p>
