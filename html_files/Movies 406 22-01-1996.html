            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Waiting to Exhale (M)<br>Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine<br>Directed by Forest Whitaker<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>IT TAKES two hours for Waiting to Exhale to almost prove the 1970s feminist adage that a ?woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle?.<br>Almost, because, contrary to what some women would like to think, there are some halfway decent men out there.<br>Waiting to Exhale is actor Forest Whitaker's directorial debut. Whitaker, brilliant in The Crying Game and Smoke, has a bit part as a nerdy boss who beds the oh so willing Robin.<br>His film is not so much a centrally plotted feature, but rather a revue-style collage of vignettes tracing four black women's search for happiness and the right man.<br>It is beautifully successful as a pretty-to-watch, well acted compilation of the problems facing 30-40-year-old modern women in the search for true ?lurv? (the film is set in Phoenix, Arizona, and they all talk like dat hunny chile.)<br>Briefly the four women and their problems are:<br>Savannah (Whitney Huston): the lovely pop diva is a television producer getting away from her affair with a married man. Huston plays the part with nonchalant ease ... and doesn't sing.<br>Bernadine (Angela Bassett): the best story and performance of the film. Bernadine, fabulously wealthy with two children, has to come to terms with separation, divorce and possible poverty after her handsome, millionaire husband runs off with a white girl ... especially galling to Bernadine.<br>Gloria (Loretta Devine): beefy, lovely and lonely Gloria yearns for a man. She's gone 10 years without sex and discovers her ex-husband is gay. As a result she dotes on and smothers her 17-year-old son. Then a good looking handyman widower, Marvin (nicely played by Gregory Hines) moves in across the street. And Marvin likes big women.<br>Robin (Lela Rochon): Robin, beautifully big-eyed and promiscuous, attracts dogs of men like flies. She's got secrets and isn't quite as silly as she looks.<br>The four are loosely joined together because they go to the same beauty parlour where Gloria is a hairdresser.<br>It is one of the least convincing aspects of the movie that the four should then become such good and close friends. After all, they are from widely different backgrounds.<br>But it is easy to let that pass when you consider some of the beautiful moments.<br>The uncredited Wesley Snipes, playing a lawyer called James, in town for a conference, befriends and romances the grieving Bernadine so wonderfully that the audience is left breathless ... waiting to exhale, in fact ... as the couple talk so quietly and touch so gently.<br>Their night together is easily the sexiest, most romantic part of a fairly sexy, very romantic film.<br>And they are fully clothed.<br>Some of the other sex scenes are truly funny as various men make right asses of themselves trying to impress. In fact many men will probably groan in embarrassment as they see their all too human frailties exposed by these four.<br>Waiting to Exhale has been greatly hyped and advertised, and it seems deservedly so. It seems certain to join Ghost and Pretty Woman as a bit of a tearjerker, a bit of fun and a good night out.<br>It is about 30 minutes too long, unfortunately, and if you're an impatient type you might fall out of love with some of the characters as a result.<br></font></p>
