            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">LIFE is full of misunderstandings. Some members of the Big Day Out audience at Bassendean on Sunday understood they were going to see a world-class rock act. They got Marilyn Manson instead.<br>Similarly, the crowd at Perth Oval on the same day had understood it would see the magnificent spectacle of a Perth Glory win over the lowly Newcastle Breakers.<br>It did not. But it did see a car-stuffing competition at half-time to make the mind boggle. Twenty of the lads from the Hill poured themselves into a small Mazda in less than a minute, smothering the competition completely. The winners then lined up for a mass slide along the turf, causing much-needed mirth among the twitchy 10,000 present.<br>Because I know that each day has potholes waiting for me to put a foot out of place, I say this little prayer: ?So far today, I've done all right . . . I haven't gossiped, haven't lost my temper, haven't been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish or over-indulgent. I'm very thankful for that. But, in a few minutes, God, I'm going to get out of bed, and from then on, I'm probably going to need a lot more help. Amen.?<br>It doesn't always work. The other week my wife and a girlfriend of hers - let's call her Kell, because that's her real name - jetted off to Melbourne in the hope of forming a love triangle with Pat Rafter. Either that or they went to see oodles of tennis at the Australian Open.<br>A few days after they left, I received an e-mail postcard on the Internet from good friends in Rome. Seeking to impress them, I wrote a reply, then put it into an English-to-Italian automatic translation service on the Net.<br>It was all free and my message looked to be in convincing Italian (I didn't really have a clue), so I sent it off. In English, it had said: ?Thanks very much for the postcard. This is David. Chris and Kell are in Melbourne at the tennis and loving it.?<br>Very quickly an e-mail whizzed back across the world from Italy. ?Oh David, such a shock. I never knew Chris and Kell would run off to Melbourne as lovers.?<br>Obviously a misunderstanding of global proportions there, thanks to the wonders of modern technology.<br>A similar English-to-Italian misunderstanding recently hit some friends who were holidaying in Europe. They had intended taking a train from Nice, in the south of France, straight to Venice in Italy. If you look at an atlas, this is a fairly direct journey.<br>But a French strike landed them in Genoa, not Venice. At least it was the right country, but on the wrong side.<br>So the GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) of the family decided to exercise her fluent Italian and made inquiries of a man in a uniform on the platform about how to get to Venice.<br>According to what she heard, a Venice-bound train was, would you believe, the next one to leave that very platform. So on they hopped, much cheered that in a few hours they would be sitting in a gondola and freezing their bottoms off.<br>In fact, in far less time, their train came to an abrupt halt. In Turin, which though still in the right country was possibly even farther from Venice than was Genoa.<br>The GYM, who with her family somehow made it back to Australia in one piece, was very sheepish about what she actually said to the man in the uniform on the platform when I asked her about the incident.<br>I assume it was the standard: ?My hovercraft is full of eels.?<br>Little adventures like these remind me of the quote by baseballer Dizzy Dean after he was hit on the head in the 1934 World Series: ?The doctors X-rayed my head and found nothing.?<br></font></p>
