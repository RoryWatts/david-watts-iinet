            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PARDON me for doing this, but I want to bang on about the differences between the sexes again. I know I write about this topic a lot, but each new day nearly always provides fresh examples to make one wonder why men and women have ever got together for anything other than a good argument.<br>Mother's Day produced some beauties. One GYM (Gorgeous Young Mum) I know got to see four football games in one day so she could bask in the love of her family.<br>She attended three separate under-age matches in which her sons were playing. Then, as a treat, her husband took her to see the Dockers at Subiaco.<br>But at least she received a box of chocolates and some flowers from her tribe with the morning cup of tea.<br>Another GYM also was taken to see the Dockers by her football-loving husband. As the final siren blew on the wonderful Freo fightback, the GYM turned to her husband and gently asked what her present was, suspecting that going to the footy was simply a way to heighten the excitement and anticipation of a new dress, pair of shoes or terracotta pot.<br>?Darling this is your present,? said the husband with a sweeping gesture to the ground below where grown men were jumping and laughing, and Tony Modra and Clive Waterhouse were waltzing. ?I've given you a Dockers' victory, a rare and wonderful thing never to be forgotten.?<br>In other parts of Perth, such as the vicinity of my own house, other GYMs were experiencing similar gestures of goodwill. I let my wife buy her own Mother's Day present. Actually she did it unannounced, then had the hide to ask me and the children to wrap it. ?And make sure you take off the price tag,? she said, leaving the three of us scratching our heads in puzzlement.<br>But we did as commanded and even came up with choccies (which we love . . . the wife does not normally eat more than one or two) and flowers.<br>I also gave her the unexpected treat of operating a power tool. Now I know such things as chainsaws, sanders and electric drills are for blokes, but if she wanted sharp knives for the dinner for six she was spending all Mother's Day preparing, she had to learn to operate a drill with an emery wheel attachment.<br>I was too busy. One of my other jobs is to write about watching sport on TV for a column called From The Armchair which appears on Tuesdays. And there was a powerful lot of football to be watched from the armchair on Mother's Day. Someone's got to do it, and my wife respects that I take my work very seriously and like to curl up on the couch shouting at Bruce McAvaney in total peace.<br>So, she had to learn how to use the drill. Actually she enjoyed it, though she did ask some interesting questions about what sort of attachments could be used to wake snoring TV watchers, and whether the use of those attachments might prove fatal.<br>These examples, I contend, again show there is an abyss between men and women. Indeed women are as easy to understand as cats. I would like to thank my Internet correspondent, Garfield, for bringing the following feline attributes to my notice. He, like me, thinks they tell us more about women than animals.<br>1) Cats do what they want.<br>2) They rarely listen to you.<br>3) They're totally unpredictable.<br>4) They whine when they are not happy.<br>5) When you want to play, they want to be alone.<br>6) When you want to be alone, they want to play.<br>7) They expect you to cater to their every whim.<br>8) They're moody.<br>9) They leave hair everywhere.<br>10) They drive you nuts and cost an arm and a leg.<br></font></p>
