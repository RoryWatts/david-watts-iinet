            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE first World Series was not played until 1903 because of feuding between the two major leagues, the American and the National.<br>Other post-season championships were played as early as 1884 and they provided the basis for the establishment of the so-called ?Fall Classic?.<br>The first championship in 1884 - between the National League's Providence club and the then American Association's New York Metropolitans - was won 3-0 by Providence. These inter-league championships continued until 1891 when renewed fighting broke out.<br>When a ?peace treaty? was signed in early 1903 between the established National League and the newly-created American League, it was primarily intended to prevent the raiding of clubs for players. It made no provisions for post-season play.<br>However, in August, with their clubs comfortably in front in the pennant races, Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss and Boston Pilgrims (later Red Sox) president Henry Killilea conceived a nine-game post-season series to showcase their teams.<br>With a handshake, the World Series was born.<br>The inaugural series proved a major success, especially for Boston, which upset the favoured Pirates, five games to three. More than 100,000 attended the eight games, including what one newspaper called a ?monster crowd? in Boston (18,801 with as many as 10,000 reported to have been turned away).<br>Gate receipts from the eight games were more than $100,000 with the winning Boston players taking home $1182 each while the losers received even more, $1316.25.<br>Pittsburgh owner Dreyfuss contributed his entire share to the players prize pool. It was the only time in World Series history that the losers took home more than the winners.<br>Statistics compiled by AAP, AP, Reuters and the Internet.<br>Last 20 World Series results<br>1976 Cincinnati Reds d New York Yankees 4-0<br>1977 New York Yankees d LA Dodgers 4-2<br>1978 New York Yankees d LA Dodgers 4-2<br>1979 Pittsburgh Pirates d Baltimore Orioles 4-3<br>1980 Philadelphia Phillies d Kansas City Royals 4-2<br>1981 Los Angeles Dodgers d New York Yankees 4-2<br>1982 St Louis Cardinals d Milwaukee Brewers 4-3<br>1983 Baltimore Orioles d Philadelphia Phillies 4-1<br>1984 Detroit Tigers d San Diego Padres 4-1<br>1985 Kansas City Royals d St Louis Cardinals 4-3<br>1986 New York Mets d Boston Red Sox 4-3<br>1987 Minnesota Twins d St Louis Cardinals 4-3<br>1988 LA Dodgers d Oakland Athletics 4-1<br>1989 Oakland Athletics d San Francisco Giants 4-0<br>1990 Cincinnati Reds d Oakland Athletics 4-0<br>1991 Minnesota Twins d Atlanta Braves 4-3<br>1992 Toronto Blue Jays d Atlanta Braves 4-2<br>1993 Toronto Blue Jays d Philadelphia Phillies 4-2<br>1994 Player strike<br>1995 Atlanta Braves d Cleveland Indians 4-2<br>Biggest attendance for a single World Series game - 92,706 for game 5 at Los Angeles, October 6, 1959.
