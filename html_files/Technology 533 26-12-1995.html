            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE amazing growth of the Internet this year has created a new brand of users with a new set of problems.<br>US sources say the Net has doubled in size every year since 1988. According to Network Wizards, there were 213 Net users in August 1981. In July 1995 there were 6.6 million and by 2000 there are expected to be 100 million.<br>There is no reason to suggest WA use of the Net lags behind these figures. The number of access providers has grown considerably in the past 12 months.<br>Telstra's recent announcement that it would triple Australia's ability to access the Net by April also shows use is exploding.<br>The type of person accessing the Net is vastly different to those who were accessing it as recently as two years ago.<br>The new user is mostly new to computers and definitely new to the world of modems.<br>A top Perth access provider recently gave a host of what it said were new problems being reported by new users.<br>A new user rings up four days after signing up, quite distressed: ?I have been trying to get a line for four days. Each time it dials up it is engaged!?<br>After asking the standard questions the help desk realised that the phone number the customer had told the modem to dial was their own.<br>One misconception is what relation a person's physical location has to their electronic mail address. Several times users have asked if moving premises will affect their e-mail address.<br>Some also ring to say they are dialling in from a different phone number. Again this has nothing to do with the Net or e-mail.<br>A woman complained that Netscape was not working.<br>?Each time I click on this link it doesn't work, nothing works, I am even trying it now, and it is not working,? she said.<br>But hundreds of others were happily accessing the World Wide Web so the woman was asked how many phone lines she had. ?Only the one,? she replied.<br>The access provider said it was an art form to explain to a user who did not understand this concept.<br>?You can only use your phone line for either the Net or a voice phone call,? the access provider said.<br>?No one told me that,? the customer retorted.<br>A man rang the provider complaining he had trouble establishing a connection. He was asked the standard questions ... name, user name, what kind of computer?, Mac or Windows?<br>The provider said there was a long pause before the man said: ?Um, umm, oh, um.?<br>The provider pointed out these were the easy questions.<br>One of the most misunderstood concepts is the phone charges.<br>For a local/metro area a user pays only the standard 25¢ to dial the provider.<br>Once connected they are free to travel all across the Internet. Some providers - not Telstra - charge for time on line<br>The provider said the funniest occasion was when a Telstra employee asked: ?I know this is probably a stupid question, but what is the phone call cost of looking at web pages in the USA??<br>One user was having trouble connecting. He was certain it was his modem so he contacted the retailer and complained.<br>He took the modem back where it was tested and no problems were found.<br>The user asked ?what is that??, pointing at the power supply. When told its function, he admitted: ?I thought it was an optional extra.?<br>Matching the growth in Net use is a growth in education for would-be Internauts.<br>IiNet Technologies, Perth's biggest access provider, now has tutorials on line, and for those who cannot connect it has documentation and, where available, disk sets for easy installation.<br>URLs: Index of Internet access providers in WA:<br>http://www.it.com.au/%7Ekimba/isp/<br>iiNet tutorials:<br>http://www.iinet.net.au/tutorial/<br></font></p>
