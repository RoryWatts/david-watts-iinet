            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE only problem with the soccer World Cup - so bountifully presented to SBS viewers - is that it is far too serious.<br>Stone-faced anchormen, Les Murray and Johnny Warren, best illustrate that this is a tournament about world domination, not some warm and fuzzy sportsfest like the Olympics.<br>At half-time in the England-Tunisia game last week, Warren and Murray were expounding on Tunisia's seemingly negative strategy of back-passing.<br>They explained it was designed to draw the English backs forward, thus opening a hole in front of goal for a swift change of attack.<br>All this was done in the patient manner of two strict headmasters.<br>Then Warren said such defensive ploys by African teams like Tunisia showed they should not have European coaches. They should be able to play with their natural flair.<br>Murray - a Hungarian refugee whose name used to be Laszlo Urge (pronounced Urgay), and therefore very European - mumbled his agreement.<br>?It was a joke Les,? said a still stone-faced Warren.<br>One sensed he had not told one since leading Australia's only World Cup challenge in 1974, and that Murray had not heard one since about the same time.<br>Still, these two and the rest of the SBS team has done some excellent work.<br>Not only has SBS earned its Soccer Bloody Soccer nickname by showing all games at all hours that must make a good VCR or good pot of coffee mandatory in soccer lovers' homes, but the highlights packages at a decent hour have made good viewing.<br>Here is more evidence of the World Cup's seriousness:<br>?Iran's players presented American opponents with a bouquet of flowers before they beat them 2-1 on Sunday night. The Americans responded by giving football pendants to the conquerors of Australia.<br>In geo-political terms, there are hardly two countries more antagonistic towards each other off the field.<br>?The BBC reported yesterday that the whole of Bangladesh was in darkness on Saturday evening when the national electricity grid collapsed because so many people tried to watch the World Cup on TV ... which still makes them luckier than thousands of Australians without access to SBS.<br>?In Scotland, TV ratings revealed that 1.8 million of Scotland's five million people watched their boys play Brazil in the tournament opener. Figures accounted only for those who watched at home ... totally missing those at the pub.<br>?Until Sunday's brutal attack on a policeman by German hooligans, the English had reigned supreme at loutish behaviour in France.<br>Is it strange that the biggest aggravation should come from supporters of a team that does not represent a real country? England, after all, is not a State, more an ideal with a set of laws.<br>Yet time after time, louts with the flag of Britain tattooed on beer guts proclaim ?Inglund's? superiority while causing mayhem.<br>?By contrast, Japanese supporters are reported to have helped clean up the rubbish in the stadium after one match.<br>Very serious lot indeed.<br></font></p>
