And a stylish, enjoyable load of rubbish it is too. French director Luc Besson, maker of good films like The Big Blue and Nikita, has obviously enjoyed being given a $100 million-plus budget to make a Hollywood blockbuster.<br>His film hits the viewer in the face with a camped-up, colourful, frenetic look at the future and clothes its cast in glitzy rags from Jean Paul Gaultier while pumping non-stop action to a synchronised soundtrack from Eric Serra.<br>Besson has fallen for the newest trick in the sci-fi book . . . set off stunning visual fireworks to a loud rock beat and hope the punters forget the lack of story.<br>The story is tosh, not surprisingly; it was conceived by Besson as a 16-year-old dreaming of escaping French provincialism.<br>Consider this: Every 5000 years the Earth is visited by a source of pure evil and anti-life. It comes in the shape of a constantly growing globe of darkness and fire from which emanates a voice that sounds like it comes from the bottom of a deep well.<br>The only way to ward off the evil is to place a perfect being in the centre of an ancient Egyptian temple where stones representing the four elements of earth, wind, water and fire are positioned strategically.<br>This knowledge is passed from generation to generation of strange priests who are in contact with the aliens who possess the ingredients of the perfect being or fifth element.<br>These aliens know the secret of life (come in, Chariots of the Gods). Curious then that they have evolved into hulking metallic creatures who seem both unable to get out of their own way or fit through doors.<br>In the 23rd century the evil globe is stationed just off Earth where it is gobbling spaceships resembling those from Star Wars (actually Besson looks like he has borrowed every alien form and spaceship from Babylon 5, Red Dwarf and Star Trek right through to Independence Day).<br>The preservers of the universe try to get their five elements to Earth but are ambushed by alien bandits hired by a meglomaniac businessman named Zorg (Gary Oldman) who is in cahoots with the supreme evil, for no known reason. (If the supreme evil is going to destroy all life, how can a megalomaniac prosper?).<br>The good aliens are wiped out, but enough is left of the supreme being for Earth doctors using fascinating regenerative surgery to reconstruct a beautiful naked girl named Le-Eluu (Milla Jovovich).<br>She escapes, falls into the lap of a no-good taxi driver called Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), then joins up with a new age priest (Ian Holm) and off they romp to find the missing elements and save the universe.<br>If you think there is a jot of intelligent drama in that, you had better keep taking the pills.<br>The Fifth Element carries this nonsense off well. Its visual splendour in creating a 23rd century New York high in the sky where all traffic flies, borrows not only from Bladerunner, but goes back as far as Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece Metropolis.<br>Besson's vision of the future is frightening. MacDonalds still does a roaring trade atop the clouds; the vehicles might fly but their designs are straight from the 1940s and 50s; and the fate of mankind still rests with unshaven, wisecracking cab drivers when considerable amounts of technology appear to have been wasted on armies, firepower and security.<br>Willis just picks up from his Die Hard days, cracks a few one-liners and lets the surrounding mayhem and effects do much of the talking.<br>Milla Jovovich, a model turned actor, gives a cute and funny side to the supreme being. And Ian Holm as the priest who sort of knows the recipe for universe-saving puts his tongue in his cheek enough to ward off seriousness.<br>As a 27-year-old told me after: ?It's great. Generation X doesn't want a story.? And that is where the film is likely to prosper as lovers of video games and 90s weirdness queue up to leave their brains at the door.<br></font></p>
