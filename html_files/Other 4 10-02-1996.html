            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PRIME Minister Paul Keating's personality is the dominant issue in forums on the Internet.<br>The main one - Labor's Soapbox - has been inundated with pro and anti-Keating messages since day one of campaign '96.<br>No other party allows the free rein Labor gives on the Net. Neither the Liberals nor Nationals publish public opinion although both solicit it.<br>Newsgroups aus.politics and aus.general host rabid discussions and appear to have a heavy conservative bias while Soapbox is one of the Net's few forums for more widespread views.<br>Murray Gavin wrote in Soapbox: ?Paul Keating has scaled the heights of statesmanship, despite the Opposition and others denigrating his progressive government initiatives at home and on the world stage.?<br>He said three speeches stamped Mr Keating as this century's foremost statesman.<br>These were at Corowa when he supported the republic, in his eulogy to the unknown soldier in Canberra, which Mr Gavin compared to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address, and the televised address on land rights when the Opposition and States were challenged to enter a ?just and lasting settlement?.<br>Another letter said: ?We have the chance by voting Labor to allow the Government to continue on its way and to change the society into (one of the most) tolerant and cohesive nations on the face of this Earth.?<br>But the anti-Keating brigade poured vitriol on this high praise.<br>?Respect? For what? For the worst recession in 60 years? For 30-plus per cent youth unemployment? For the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer? For our credit rating lower then New Zealand's for the first time in 20 years? For a "leadership' attitude based on schoolyard methods of abuse and belittlement?? wrote one.<br>And another: ?I'm sick to death of arrogant Paul (Asian Puppet) Keating. He is selling out and selling off our country.?<br></font></p>
