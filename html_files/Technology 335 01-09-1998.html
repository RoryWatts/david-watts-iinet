            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE number of conspiracy theories on the Internet is no doubt evidence of a conspiracy to make users stay connected longer so that they lose touch with real life and become easy prey for mind control.<br>Precious gems of the human imagination are running wild out there in cyberspace.<br>Take these two postings last weekend from the alt.conspiracy newsgroup:<br>? ?The powers that be are orchestrating a worldwide depression. The goal is to bring back slavery.?<br>? ?The entire Clinton sex scandal was a distraction, and did it work good. Just as good as the OJ trials. The Clinton apology was even more of a distraction. It was meant to distract the media from real actions by OA (Omega Agency, a New World Order group which controls Clinton like a puppet) while they set up for their attempt at takeover in 2000.?<br>Just by typing Harold Holt in the window of the Australian Anzwers search engine, it is possible to get a local conspiracy feel.<br>About 1500 results are returned, but it is number 13 before you find a site that is not a spoof or conspiracyrelated.<br>The 20th match is a highly informative fact sheet about the former Liberal prime minister who drowned off Portsea, Victoria, while swimming in December 1967.<br>Or did he? Before the factual site, the results are dominated by articles from a Queensland alternative paper called The Bug that appears to delight in taking the micky.<br>Under the headline ?Grisly find debunks "Holt did a bolt' theory?, The Bug ?reports? that: ?The discovery in Cambodia of the remains of former Australian prime minister Harold Holt would finally lay to rest the disgraceful rumours that the Liberal leader had fled the country willingly, committed suicide or drowned, Australia's foremost political analyst said this week.?<br>This, by the way, is the number one result returned by Anzwers. Further down is a more serious attempt at discussing the alleged Holt conspiracy by Channel 9's Sunday show.<br>Sunday uses the Web to showcase its television show and has its more sober Holt story in a section called Sleuth's Corner which invites Netizens to e-mail their opinions.<br>This morning (WA time), hundreds or perhaps thousands of people around the world were involved in a global two-hour chat session discussing the conspiracy theories behind the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, a year ago yesterday.<br>Cyber-talk of conspiracies about Diana started within two or three hours of her death.<br>The chat session today was touted as an attempt to draw out some expert and hopefully sceptical discussion.<br>The chat has been organised by the Conspiracy Theory Discussion Board which uses its Web site to pose the many conspiracy theories behind Diana's death. It also links to 16 sites around the world dedicated to the Diana conspiracy.<br>And, as they say in the ads, there's more. There are links to 20 sites which deal entirely with conspiracy theories. They bear titles such as: The Disinformation Site; 50 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time Site; Conspiracy Encyclopedia; The Smoking Gun, and JFK: The Mother of All Conspiracy Theories.<br>But back to the Diana chat. The Conspiracy Theory Discussion Board believes her death to be the crime of the century.<br>It claims many of the thousands of people who have discussed the death in the past year are ?typically not individuals who are conspiracy-minded?.<br>Among their number are said to be doctors from Australia and Denmark who have debunked some of the medical reports concerning Princess Diana and Henri Paul; a Nascar engineer who explains in technical terms how the Mercedes may have been rigged, and a political consultant with experience in public figure safety threats.<br>This is fertile ground if you are so inclined.<br>HELP DESK<br>Anzwers:<br>www.anzwers.com.au<br>The Bug:<br>www.thebug.com.au<br>Channel 9 on Harold Holt:<br>sunday.ninemsn.com.au/inv-sleuth7.htm<br>Conspiracy Theory Discussion Board:<br>www.internet-inquirer.com<br>Diana and other conspiracy links:<br>www.internet-inquirer.com./<br>princess-diana-conspiracy3.htm<br></font></p>
