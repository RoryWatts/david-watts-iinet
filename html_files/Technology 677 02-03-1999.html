            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET free speech lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia has accused Internet Names Australia (INA) of censoring the Net by arbitrarily deregistering a domain name that complied with INA's published policy.<br>INA is the administrator of the key com.au domain.<br>Domain names are absolutely central to a business's online presence, according to EFA board member Irene Graham.<br>?Deregistration of domains at the whim of INA creates serious uncertainties for Australian businesses,? Ms Graham said.<br>The controversy arises from an Australian business which recently registered the domain fuck.com.au claiming the ribald name was an abbreviation of the business name Futurechicks. Three weeks after approving the domain name, INA deregistered the domain, saying approval was granted in error and the name was ?unacceptable?. ?INA has demonstrated that it is out of touch with prevailing community standards,? Ms Graham said.<br>She said the word in question was permitted in films and videos that children could legally view without parental supervision, in accordance with classification guidelines established under Australian censorship laws.<br>?INA must comply with its published policy and reinstate the domain,? Ms Graham said. ?Failure to do so sends a message to all Australian businesses that receipt of approval of a domain name from INA is worthless. At any moment, INA is likely to retract approval.?<br>She claimed INA's attempts to sanitise the Web were misguided.<br>South Australian business Hydrocorp has engaged Perth-based technology lawyers K. Heitman & Co to appeal against INA's ruling.<br>No one will find this site through search engines without typing the word in question first, said Hydrocorp's lawyer, Kimberley Heitman.<br>?It is a word printed in the Macquarie Dictionary, and the domain name drew up to 1000 visitors a day,? Mr Heitman said.<br>?The site did not contain illegal content, and earned money from advertising.<br>?This is not the first time INA has tried to impose censorship of Internet addresses. The band TISM was refused the domain name wanker.com.au, and had to buy the domain name wanker.com from America instead.?<br>INA business development manager Michael Dowling confirmed the company had withdrawn the allegedly obscene domain name.<br>He refused to say whether he thought INA was engaging in unnecessary censorship.<br>A director of INA parent company Melbourne Technologies, Peter Gerrand, agreed the deregistration constituted censorship of the Net.<br>But with a review of domain naming practices expected shortly, it was best to take a conservative approach, he said.<br>INA's Web page lists the conditions for granting domain names. On Saturday there was a clause 3.9 relating to offensive or obscene names.<br>It said in part: ?It has been the policy of INA to reject domain names, which by themselves or as part of a name or word, by normally accepted standards are unacceptable because they are obscene, offensive or contrary to public policy.?<br>EFA spokesman Danny Yee said the trouble was that the clause was not present the day before and certainly not when the controversial site was withdrawn.<br>Help Desk<br>Electronic Frontiers Australia: www.<br>efa.org.au<br>Internet Names Australia: www.<br>ina.com.au<br></font></p>
