            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MORE than 120 Australians voted in the Federal election yesterday, but it did not count.<br>A trickle of people - 124 by early afternoon - had registered their preferences at a new election site on the World Wide Web of the Internet.<br>The trend was decidedly for John Howard and the Liberal-National coalition. Labor was well back in second place but well ahead of the Greens who were just pipping the Democrats and ?other?.<br>The 34.14 per cent to 23.57 that the coalition had over Labor may not mean much when the real poll is held on March 2.<br>Global Net surveys run late last year show most users are white-collar, male and professionals or students.<br>This small sector is hardly representative of the Australian electorate.<br>The voting figures, which by the end of the campaign could number in the tens of thousands, are still too small to give any indication of Net users' intentions, let alone act as a reliable indicator.<br>The only correlation with traditional polls is the lead held by the coalition. Labor Party figures averaging all published opinion polls and available on the Net show that since April last year the coalition has averaged about 46 per cent and Labor about 39.<br>These figures remained static from April to January when Prime Minister Paul Keating announced the election.<br>The poll is run by Internet Protocol, which says it is Australia's first Internet election poll.<br>Visitors to the site have to register by e-mail before they can vote. A code number is then e-mailed to the voter's address. The code is input when voting.<br>The vote is then e-mailed to Internet Protocol and the results at its site are updated automatically.<br>Poll results as they come to hand are available on the Internet at: http://www.interpro.netnet.au/cgi-bin/results.shtml.<br>?The National Party now has an official Web site, joining Labor, the Liberals, the Democrats and the Greens (WA).<br>Under a photograph of leader Tim Fischer, the party lists branches, membership details, coalition policy statements and has a spot for users to e-mail comments.<br></font></p>
