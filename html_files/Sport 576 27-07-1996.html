            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DREW MORPHETT won Channel 7's first gold medal of the Games in the complacency stakes yesterday.<br>In the serious event of race calling, he appeared a little off the pace.<br>Darryn Hill and Garry Neiwand are strong medal prospects in the sprint, but not the foregone conclusions Morphett had viewers believing.<br>In Neiwand's quarter final he was pressed closely by a fighting Greek opponent. Morphett told viewers as the pair headed for the straight: ?Garry's got him here. He'll just swing round him.?<br>He did just swing round him, but the Greek did not budge and the finish was a thriller.<br>Hill took on American William Clay. Same scenario: into the final turn Hill started to round the American.<br>?Seeya later,? said Morphett.<br>Only trouble was Clay stuck like, well, clay, and Hill needed all his power to shake him.<br>Anne Fullwood in the studio congratulated Morphett on his calling. Either she did not know what she was talking about (which some viewers I've spoken to suspect) or she has a nice line in sarcasm.<br>Morphett and Phil Anderson left viewers confused with the outcome of Brad McGee's individual pursuit joust with Italian world record holder Andrea Collinelli.<br>McGee rode well but the 20-year-old was overwhelmed by the brilliant Italian. Morphett and Anderson suggested McGee may have been holding off for a ride for the bronze medal, knowing he had little chance against Collinelli.<br>That was a bit close to claiming he was throwing the race. But in a later cross, viewers found that McGee had been the fastest semi-final loser, and that was enough to give him the bronze.<br>There was no such confusion at the rowing, where Australian crews continued to impress in the semi-finals.<br>There are definite medal prospects here as in the cycling. One of the best is the Oarsome Foursome II in the coxless fours.<br>The foursome's semi was a nail-biter ending in a blanket finish with Italy and France. All three qualified for the final, and although Australia finished third, it was easy to see the crew had plenty in reserve.<br>THE great super slow-motion replay of the Australians powering to the finish line showed four men who seemed content to make a thrilling race of it.<br>At the pool the shadow of Kieren Perkins' slow 1500m freestyle qualifying time - 40 seconds off his world record - loomed large.<br>It wasn't a big enough cloud to hide the sunny smile of Penhros student Julia Greville after she, Nicole Stevenson, Susie O'Neill and Emma Johnson won bronze in the 4x200m relay.<br>But Perkins was the big news. Neil Brooks, the realist with some wise words about our swimmers, believes Perkins cannot come back from here when he races in the final this morning.<br>I think Perkins has as much chance as the Dockers against Carlton ... stranger things have happened.<br></font></p>
