            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Trainspotting (M)<br>Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Johhny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle<br>Directed by Danny Boyle<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>THE worst toilet in Scotland is in an Edinburgh betting shop. The floor is littered and soaked and the WC is - filthy is too kind a word - putrid. But it is a funny place when heroin addict Renton loses a suppository down the reeking loo and dives in to retrieve it.<br>How can this be? What has just been described is surely degradation at its worst. Yet Danny Boyle's marvellous Trainspotting takes such taboos and puts a human face on them so well that this and equally tasteless scenes smell like roses.<br>Trainspotting concerns the lives of a group of young Edinburgh heroin addicts. Their grotty existence is seen through the eyes of Renton (Ewan McGregor) who takes the viewer to the highs of his chosen addiction - ?100 times better than the best orgasm? - to the pits of dehumanisation and depravity.<br>Attacked in some quarters as a glamorisation of heroin, Trainspotting most assuredly is nothing of the kind. Sane viewers will see it as the exact opposite in fact, particularly when the addicts fall to pieces after the baby of one of their crew is found dead and grotesquely twisted in its cot.<br>The infant comes back to haunt later in the film in the nightmarish scenes of cold turkey withdrawal for Renton.<br>Trainspotting is adapted from the 1993 bestselling cult novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh. The book presented its story as a series of vignettes about individual characters but the film has welded them together through Renton's eyes and, of necessity, reproduced only the highlights - lowlights in reality - of the book.<br>To take such a chilling subject and end up presenting it as a refreshing, humorous, charming, witty and troubling film shows the mastery of director Danny Boyle and his excellent cast.<br>They have coped with reality far better than the subjects they portray and far better than moralising anti-drugs movies or Hollywood cheap drugs and violence actioners ever could.<br>The main characters are the most endearing bunch of low-lifes seen on the screen since Goodfellas or The Godfather.<br>Renton, because the film is seen through his eyes, has most to tell. He yearns for material things and a better life but finds beating heroin is the toughest battle on earth.<br>His cohorts include the lovably ugly and almost incoherent Spud (Ewen Bremner) who provides one of many memorable comic highlights when he fronts for a job interview while grilled to the nostrils on speed.<br>Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) is the handsome, assured addict who drives Renton mad by being able to drop in or out of heroin addiction as breezily as if he were changing socks.<br>The most terrifying character is not hooked at all. Begbie (brilliantly portrayed by Robert Carlyle) is your certifiably violent, stringy nutter. He picks fights with whole pubs full of bigger people and wins with menacing ferocity, often pulling a knife on his mates as he goes over the top yet again.<br>Saddest of all is the fit, vital and initially drug-free Tommy (Kevin McKidd) who is madly in love with Lizzy (Pauline Lynch). They like to spice up their lovemaking by watching videos of themselves in previous horizontal encounters.<br>The pivotal point of the film, the launching of Tommy into the quagmire of addiction, is ironically one of the funniest moments as well.<br>Renton swaps a video of Tommy and Lizzy making love with one of another, perhaps greater, Scottish passion - ?100 Top Goals?.<br>The mix-up when discovered by Lizzy is the catalyst for broken hearts and Tommy's ultimately broken body.<br>The addicts live in the most abject squalor this side of the streets of Calcutta and when not totally zonked on heroin indulge in petty crimes like shoplifting and housebreaking to help finance their habits.<br>The crimes are presented matter of factly, so much so that when Renton, Spud and Sick Boy take the drugs virtually from the mouths of the elderly and dying in a nursing home, there isn't a feeling of shock and outrage, but more of calm surprise (?What will they think of next??).<br>Like all good films, Trainspotting is a continual question of what will happen next.<br>What does happen is done with as much verve and excitement as the biggest and best Hollywood blockbusters but keeps the best of British cynicism and gritty realism.<br>Trainspotting has been a much-hyped film in Britain where some critics have hailed it as the best film of the 90s. With four years to go that remains on the table for adjudication.<br>But it will be a worthy contender. The fine acting, marvellous direction and one of the best contemporary rock scores assure it of that as does the story.<br></font></p>
