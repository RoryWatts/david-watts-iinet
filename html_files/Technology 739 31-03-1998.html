            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">www.museum.wa.gov.au/downs/<br>Down Syndrome Awareness Week may be over for another year but this Web site provides information all year round in an easy to read and navigate fashion. The site's main page utilises a series of black and white thumbnail images that were originally exhibited by photographer Mona Neumann last year. Clicking on the image takes you to a bigger version of the photo and information aimed at dispelling the myths about people with Down Syndrome, with topics including "how dare you suggest our mothers are old? and ?anything you can do we can do too.? Also contained within this site is a list of other resources, plus the Web page of the Down Syndrome Association of WA, which includes the association's mission and goals as well as details of its new parent kit, support groups, playgroup and social events. (SY)<br>Lotteries Commission<br>www.lottery.wa.gov.au<br>Feeling lucky? Players of Saturday Lotto, Super 66, Oz Lotto and Powerball Lotto can now get results of games at the Lotteries Commission Web site from 10pm on the the night of the draw. So no more setting the video to watch the balls tumble or waiting to catch them on a late news broadcast. And, if your lucky numbers do come up, you can now check you prize dividend at the site from 10am the morning after the draw. The site also has details about the games and how to play them as well as information on the way the Lotteries Commission of Western Australia distributes the income received from the sale of Lotteries products to hospitals, the arts etc. (SY)<br>Cats! Wild to Mild<br>www.lam.mus.ca.us/cats/<br>The Friskies PetCare company of the US is behind this site, but commercialism does not intrude unnecessarily on a good, informative online exhibition. It promises to trace the natural history of the cat from its wild, exotic origins to its place as top family pet.Information as diverse as cat mythology, biology, behaviour, conservation, and responsible pet care are presented in dozens of pages packed with illustrations and animations. All manner of felines are here, from the tabby to tigers, leopards, lions, jaguars, pumas etc. (DW).<br>Bien-dire<br>www.biendire.com<br>Are you an English speaking adult learning or planning to learn French? Then this site, an offshoot of the Bein-dire quarterly journal, should be of interest. You can use an online form to subscribe to the journal (about $49 for the year, according to the automatic currency converter), apply to read or hear an extract of one of the editions, order French study guides and aids, even buy French craft gifts such as salt cellars, pepperpots, a corkscrew in the shape of a wine bottle or a baguette-shaped knife. (SY)<br>Send Your Name to Mars<br>spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/mars/<br>The US space agency, Nasa, wants to put one million children in space next year. Not literally, but via a CD-ROM that will bear the names of one million schoolchildren from around the world. The CD will be in the payload of the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft which is due to enter the Martian atmosphere on December 3 next year, then land within 800km of the red planet's south pole. This site allows children to register for the program and to earn a certificate showing that their name will be on Mars. First in, best dressed. (DW).<br>PBS Kids: Techknow<br>www.pbs.org/kids/techknow/<br>The American public broadcaster PBS has presented this site to try to educate children about safe Web surfing. It presents 11 interactive questions, which if answered correctly, lead to an online certificate. Topics covered include URL recognition, passwords, security information (what details you shouldn't give out online) and e-mail behaviour (how much you should give away to perfect strangers). (DW).<br>Salvador Dali Art Gallery<br>members.aol.com/Daliweb/<br>The work of the master surrealist is presented in 10 online galleries assembled in chronological order. A total of 120 paintings are available to view and there are 39 critical analyses of the work, including an essay written in 1944 by George Orwell. The site promises more paintings and analyses soon. It is an invaluable addition to the growing world of virtual art galleries which allow Netizens at least to pretend they have beautiful collections (even if they are just bits of wallpaper or low-resolution printouts).
