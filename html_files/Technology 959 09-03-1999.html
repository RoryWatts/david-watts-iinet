            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Linux operating system is one step closer to challenging Windows on domestic users' desktops.<br>Thousands of adherents of the open-source software learnt at the LinuxWorld conference in San Jose, California, last week that the OS is about to be dressed up for average - instead of just power - computer users.<br>The Free Software Foundation released the GNU Network Object Model Environment (Gnome) graphical user interface at the conference.<br>Gnome's purpose is to make it possible for average users to use Linux or other free Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD.<br>Gnome's creators say it should be possible for most desktop users to do all their work without knowing any more about the underlying operating system than a Windows user knows about MS-DOS.<br>Users will be able to access applications, send e-mail and browse the Web without writing a single command line. They will also be able to configure the system to have the look and feel of Macintosh, Windows or other commercial GUIs.<br>?The problem right now is that Linux has been neglected, only to use on server computers,? Miguel de Icaza, chief designer of Gnome, told the online journal TechWeb.<br>Gnome will be included in the next Linux release by Red Hat, the leading vendor of pre-packaged Linux systems.<br>The addition of a truly user-friendly GUI may solve one of the biggest problems Linux faces in the domestic market. Home users with enough computing knowledge and patience have been installing the OS in growing numbers in the past year.<br>But some have been frustrated by a lack of accompanying applications and have reverted to Windows, despite reporting that Linux was more stable and faster.<br>Software vendors have not raced to provide applications for home use because Linux is still seen as a power OS best used in the server market.<br>In this market, it has gained support from IBM and Netscape among other big companies, and is seen as a big threat to Microsoft Windows NT because of its reliability.<br>Late last year Australia's Apcmag started selling Red Hat installation CDs and manuals cheaply from its Web site and newsagents. Many domestic users in Perth tried out this version of Linux.<br>But reaction was not always favourable.<br>A vigorous discussion in one Perth newsgroup found people who believed Linux was not worth the time or that it was elitist.<br>The bottom line appeared to be that dissatisfied Windows users should not jump to Linux for a quick fix.<br>One newsgroup poster summed this up by saying: ?Getting the most out of it takes time, practice, some reading and experimenting.?<br>The man who invented Linux in 1991, Linus Torvalds, revealed a relaxed attitude to the growing popularity of the OS when he was the star attraction at the San Jose conference.<br>?There's always a danger of overhyping Linux, and I just hope people will just be realistic. We want to take over the world but we don't have to do it by tomorrow - it's okay to do it by next week, or even next month,? Mr Torvalds said.<br>His appearance at the conference caused near chaos.<br>Organisers had expected a crowd in the hundreds, but an estimated 6000 turned up to hear their hero speak.<br>A news report at the LinuxWorld Web site said that the conference resembled a Rolling Stones concert, as auditorium doors flew open and enthusiasts literally charged to the front to see Mr Torvalds.<br>LinuxWorld: www.linuxworld.com<br>Gnome: www.gnome.org<br></font></p>
