            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THEY are all mad in Melbourne of course. We suspect as much in winter during the AFL season when Victorians trot out the likes of Rex Hunt, Bobby Davis, Lou Richards, Sam Newman and Doug Hawkins.<br>In summer there is the one and only - thankfully - Bill Lawry.<br>We in the West are quite staid by comparison. When do we go truly ga-ga? Maybe a little at the Perth Cup or Kalgoorlie Round. Once, certainly, at the America's Cup.<br>New South Welshmen seem to hold it all in until the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.<br>South Australians go extra mad over the Crows and Port Power. But they haven't got anything else to cheer about.<br>Queenslanders went mad when they won the Sheffield Shield for the first time but haven't really fallen out of their trees since marching against Joh Bjelke-Petersen.<br>But the Victorians ... all year they dress up and parade around their excellent arenas, talking code, singing club songs, going multi-coloured in the face. You'd think they'd need a rest by spring. Happily for sports fans they do not.<br>If it wasn't for the spring racing carnival there would be little to marvel at on the box. Channel 10 has the baseball World Series between Cleveland and Florida, but that is very late and the language of change-ups, bull-pens and RBIs needs more study than the late hours provide.<br>Ten also has the National Basketball League grand final between Melbourne Tigers and South-East Melbourne Magic. Remember the NBL? It used to draw good audiences on TV in Perth, but Ten got the heebie-jeebies about AFL dominance and shoved it into the insomniacs' hours.<br>Domestic cricket is just starting on Nine and we will just have to guess how good Adam Gilchrist's double-century was, and Steve Waugh's, and Matthew Elliott's big ton; not to mention Jo Angel's form. All eyes are on the one-dayers.<br>Sometimes this is good, like yesterday when Victorian wicketkeeper Darren Berry warmed up the screens with his wild 50 off 28 balls.<br>But too often it means having to watch matches like Tasmania v South Australia on a sleepy Sunday.<br>So racing has saved our bacon. It is a marvellous sport for TV, so rich in characters, colour and action.<br>Nine had its big fling with the Cox Plate from Moonee Valley on Saturday and was rewarded with a stunning boilover when 40/1 shot Dane Ripper won. It covered the race from every angle so well that with the many replays it was possible even for a non-racegoer to see just how good WA's Damien Oliver is.<br>The Cox Plate is such a good race and such a big day that Nine treats it like the Melbourne Cup - it hasn't got the real thing; that will be on Ten.<br>This may explain another little piece of Victorian madness. With the cameras focused on the mounting yard, Simon O'Donnell was heard to exclaim: ?There are the two most famous trees in the world.?<br>Well, they are famous now Simon.<br></font></p>
