            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WWW7: Seventh World Wide Web conference<br>www7.conf.au<br>The Seventh World Wide Web conference in Brisbane last week would have been nerd heaven. Tim Berners-Lee, universally credited with inventing the Web, was the big attraction and had fascinating things to say about the future of the medium. Conference delegates set a world record when 172 of them were connected to the Net simultaneously in a huge Internet cafe - somewhat under the organisers' hopes for 1000 online, but a record nevertheless. This site is the conference's home page and has all the gritty details. Workshops dealt with topics such as re-use of Web-based information, Web engineering, the new generation of HTTP, learning online, libraries on the Web and cyberspace law. The WWW7 site will give surfers a clue about issues that will affect them all. (DW)<br>R-Zu-2-U<br>www.rzu2u.com<br>So you've always wanted a giant gambian pouched rat but never known what the little tykes like to munch on? This is the site for you. The creators of R-Zu-2-U, when they are not busy murdering the English language, dedicate themselves to properly informing Netizens of the needs and habitats of exotic pets. Whether you are into fruits bats, hyenas, or the worthy zorrilla - a skunk-like critter - this site will let you know where the creature in question comes from, what it eats and what bad habits it has. And in case you don't know what the aforementioned giant rat looks like, there are plenty of pictures. (HC)<br>Inside Interpol<br>193.123.144.14/interpol.com<br>This is the official Web site of Interpol, the international police organisation. The interesting thing about these pages is that they get down to details. For example, there is a gallery of the most valuable works of art stolen worldwide. So if you want to know whether that old scrap of canvas you picked up at the local swap-meet is stolen, check this site out. You may have a Pieter Brueghel II hanging in your lounge room. Also missing from its rightful owners is an ancient manuscript of Ptolemy's book Cosmographia. There is also some potentially useful research on international crime trends. (HC)<br>The path to peace<br>www.irish-times.com/irishtimes/<br>special/peace/index.htm<br>The news that put the good in Good Friday was the negotiation of a peace deal for Northern Ireland. The hope is that the bloodlust of the past 30 years will end. The Irish Times in Dublin provides an in-depth report of this struggle for peace at its comprehensive site. It features an historical perspective, details of the agreement, summaries of main players such as British PM Tony Blair, pages of reaction, a look at what the peace process involved and analysis from special writers. An excellent links page takes the surfer to sites as diverse as those maintained by Sinn Fein and Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists. The historical perspective page makes fascinating reading. It operates in chronological cells, going right back to 1169, the date of the Normans' first incursion into Ireland. This presentation, putting the deal in a context of 800 years of conflict, sheds much light on the difficulties of finding peace. (DW)<br>The Darwin Awards<br>www.darwinawards.com<br>It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry at the Darwin Awards site. In its own words, the site ?commemorates those who douse the gene pool with chlorine by finding innovatively moronic ways of killing themselves, thereby helping to eliminate undesirable weaknesses from the genome. The single-minded purpose and self-sacrifice of the nominees, and the spectacular means by which they off themselves, is laudable and not to be scoffed at.? The first recipient this year was an Argentine man who threw his wife out of their eighth-storey flat, only to discover that she landed safely on power lines. In a fit of rage, he jumped out after her, but missed the lines and plunged to his death.
