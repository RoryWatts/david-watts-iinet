            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Federal Government's latest bid to curb offensive content on the Internet has run into a storm of cynicism, contempt and disbelief.<br>Communications Minister Richard Alston announced on Friday a new regime to tackle pornography in particular.<br>But experienced Net users and free speech campaigners were denouncing the crackdown several days earlier after media reports predicted the announcement.<br>By Sunday, more than 150 messages had been posted in discussion threads on the proposals in the Usenet newsgroup, aus.censorship. Only a handful supported Senator Alston's stronger censorship moves.<br>The majority lashed out at proposals that correspondents considered unworkable and technologically ignorant.<br>A consistent criticism was that the crackdown had been announced to appease Independent Senator Brian Harradine so that the Government could have his vote on major issues such as Telstra privatisation and the GST.<br>A poll at Ninemsn's technology news site showed on Sunday that 1134 people believed the crackdown was ?a cynical attempt to win the Harradine vote?. Only 194 disagreed with the notion.<br>One correspondent to aus.censorship described the crackdown as having ?all the usual elements of a politician's response to a problem (i.e. how to persuade Senator Harradine to put the GST through)?.<br>Another wrote: ?This is less about Internet censorship than it is about placating Harradine. All Alston is trying to achieve is to convince Harradine that the coalition is "attempting to do something'. Not that they actually "can do something'.?<br>Several people said Senator Alston's crackdown involved similar philosophies and technologies to those used in countries such as Singapore and Saudi Arabia. Fears were expressed that once Australia tried to filter pornography from the Net, then erotic literature and alternate radical political speech, among other features of the free-wheeling medium, would be added to blacklists.<br>It is believed that more than 8.5 million sites, most of them US-based, fit Senator Alston's criteria of being offensive.<br>He said on Friday that use would be made of improved filtering technologies and ?guessing engines? to eliminate such sites.<br>But correspondents to aus.censorship have pointed out the difficulties of regulating sites not based in Australia, particularly those that are legal in the country where they are based. Australians could easily move material regarded as offensive offshore and frustrate the new regime.<br>Other critics have pointed out that Senator Alston's announcement appeared to deal with Web sites and said nothing about newsgroups, chat lines or e-mail.<br>Perth lawyer Kim Heitman, chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia, described the moves as ignorant and draconian.<br>?The latest proposal by the Government sets the debate on Internet censorship back three years,? he said. ?The Government is ignoring the expert advice of Internet industry associations and user groups, computer professionals, and even government departments.?<br>Almost all the targeted material was legal in the US, so Australia was trying to restrict access to what would certainly remain available from overseas.<br>?Attempts elsewhere to control external content with "black lists' and forced use of proxies are acknowledged failures. China, Singapore, and some Islamic states are among the few countries that still persist with them. Even Malaysia has announced that it is abandoning Net censorship attempts,? Mr Heitman said.<br>Any censorship plans needed long, public debate and should not be rushed.<br></font></p>
