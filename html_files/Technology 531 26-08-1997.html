            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Internet service providers could virtually remove Australia from the World Wide Web if the Federal Government carries out its Internet censorship plans.<br>The warning that sites in the .au domain could be blocked was issued by the WA Internet Association last week.<br>WAIA said blocking Australian sites was one of several serious recommendations that might make the Government sit up and take notice that its benign-sounding plans were dangerous to the future of the Net in Australia.<br>The Government blueprint released last month puts the onus on ISPs to regulate content and makes them liable for any content found objectionable.<br>WAIA spokesman Kim Heitman told Access the Government was three years behind the times, equating online content with offline as a model for regulation.<br>?The Net has already debunked that idea and moved on to international standards,? he said.<br>There were three ?dreadful? errors in the proposed legislation:Confusing access providers with content providers.Making the Australian Broadcasting Authority a gung-ho regulator.Using The Office of Film and Literature classifications for global media.<br>In response, Mr Heitman said WAIA would tell its ISP members to seriously consider:Moving contentious material, even ?adult? material expressly permitted under the WA Censorship Act to offshore hosting services.Limiting or even blocking access to Australian sites.Moving administrative facilities to offshore sites such as Malaysia.Giving ISPs the right to delete hosted material such as users' Web pages without redress or compensation.<br>Mr Heitman said WAIA believed ISPs should be exempt from liability for the content of others.<br>?ISPs carry others' content without examination or opportunity to review,? he said.<br>The online services industry would not develop if it was impossible for ISPs to comply with different State and Territory laws.<br>They could not operate networks across State boundaries or permit access to and from Australian sites if there was uncertainty about their legal obligations, Mr Heitman said.<br>The Government needed a narrow and precise definition of objectionable material to make legislation workable.<br>WAIA said this should be restricted to the publication of child sexual abuse images because ?that material is uniformly prohibited throughout the countries that comprise the global Internet?.<br>?Unlike commercial broadcasters, many ISPs are not viable businesses to the extent of employing legal and reporting staff,? Mr Heitman said.<br>?A regulatory model which is cumbersome and designed around the administrative capabilities of large national ISPs will prove to be too onerous and expensive for small ISPs.?An electronic petition against the Government's proposals has attracted nearly 2000 signatures. The petition has been framed by leading user group Electronic Frontiers Australia.<br>HELP DESK<br>WA Internet Association:www.waia.asn.au<br>Government proposals:www.dca.gov.au/policy/fwork-4-online-svces/framework.h<br>EFA campaign:www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/<br>contreg.html<br>Newsgroup discussions:<br>aus.org.efa<br></font></p>
