            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">COMMENT<br>THE Labor and Liberal parties have failed to take advantage of arguably the most democratic medium available in this campaign - the Internet.<br>The Liberal Party is by far the worst offender, shrinking into an old-fashioned, comfortable hole, apparently safe from public gaze while pretending it is up with the times and accountable.<br>More than 100,000 Australians have access to the Internet and probably 95 per cent of them would be voters.<br>It is an unparalleled medium for exchange of views and ideas. It is argued that the Net is in its infancy but millions of people throughout the world know they can say what they believe and have a global audience.<br>Yet the powerhouses driving our political parties are inept at doing the same thing as their constituents. Worse, they firmly believe their efforts are OK.<br>The Liberals are prime examples. Until last weekend, the party presented its policies, its philosophies, how to become a member, latest media releases and miscellaneous information at an unofficial but party-authorised site on the World Wide Web.<br>At the weekend, the party launched an official site with less, not more information, and less public accountability.<br>The man who maintained the old site and helped prepare the new, Canberra technical officer and party follower David Moss, claims that the inclusion of e-mail addresses for all Liberal candidates is a major democratic triumph.<br>The bulk of any e-mail sent to the addresses supplied would actually go to a central sorting office for distribution - or not - to the candidate.<br>It is surface democracy, a clumsy attempt to look accountable.<br>Nowhere does the average voter have a place to put his thoughts in the open and, most importantly, have his questions, fears or doubts replied to publicly by a politician.<br>A public meeting in a sweltering suburban town hall is far more democratic than this high-technology excuse for an election hustings.<br>The positive side is that all Liberal policies are in the open. Mr Moss claims more than 700 people a day are reading them.<br>Labor was first on the Web with an official site more than a year ago. It is full of party history, educational resources, international links and philosophy.<br>And it has a powerful section called Soapbox where any person can say what he or she likes about politics and be published.<br>This has led to a lot of anti-Labor, anti-Paul Keating e-mail.<br>But the party has at least had the guts to admit this is the price of democracy.<br>But, like the Liberal site, there is no feedback from the politicians themselves. In the US, admittedly into cyberspace well before Australia, presidential candidates have virtually been nailed to the wall and told to respond publicly to questions from the electorate.<br>Labor says it has not made the site a major campaign tool, preferring to use it as an information source.<br>Dennis Perry, a spokesman for the Labor site, said yesterday he expected the scene would be far different by 1999.<br>More candidates would have e-mail addresses and the Web would be used more tellingly.<br>To do that our political parties must realise the Net is a two-way street.<br>Otherwise voters will set their own agenda, put it on the Net and let the whole world know about it.<br></font></p>
