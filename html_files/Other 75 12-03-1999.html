            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAD to happen. We grow older, but we don't necessarily grow up. I find I have reverted to a second childhood. This is not what it might seem to many readers.<br>The fact is my own childhood was so long ago, it is but a dim haze. I have reverted to my own children's childhood instead.<br>It started the other day when my teenage daughter and her friend were lounging around watching some rock music program, one of those that goes for hours. This program went on so long it had to start playing music from earlier eras to fill the time. It went right back to the mid-1980s in fact, and plucked out Billy Idol, or Boy George, or the Pretenders . . . I find it difficult to remember exact details these days.<br>?Oh the 80s were so gross,? squealed my daughter.?Yeah, look at those fashions, listen to that daggy music,? agreed her friend.<br>?Can you believe we were born in the middle of all that. It's disgusting. It makes me embarrassed,? said my girl.<br>I yearned to tell her what a wonderful time it was; how delightful to see her toddling around in little party dresses while playing with My Little Pony.<br>But I could not say a word. I had come over all peculiar with blubbering nostalgia at such thoughts.<br>When my misty eyes cleared enough to focus on the three-year-old dog, I even started to remember fondly his puppyhood.<br>How as a little tacker he used to grab stuffed toys and race out into the front yard where he would do unmentionable things to them.<br>This invariably happened just as the girls' school across the road broke up for the day, and his antics were witnessed by a passing parade of primary kiddies.<br>But back to the teenagers. These were the same girls, who in those loathsome 1980s, used to be thrilled by the music of Noni Hazlehurst and others on Play School.<br>Now they want nothing more than a big dose of the Spice Girls, All Saints or Hole.<br>Perhaps the world has come a long way now that teenage girls have all-girl groups to idolise instead of the likes of the Bay City Rollers or Bobby Sherman or Zoot.<br>I, however, like Germaine Greer, am not convinced. Shortly after The Female Eunuch was released, Dr Greer was quoted in an article in Rolling Stone magazine as saying: ?I wrote a book because words are my thing. What we really need is an all-girl rock and roll band that can lay down a riff no one'll be able to forget.?<br>Nearly 30 years later, Dr Greer is back with her newest book, Whole Woman, to tell us where modern womanhood has strayed. I fancy she still has not heard a good riff from an all-girl band either.<br>Maybe she is reverting to an earlier age, not necessarily a second childhood, to try to make sense of a world where, on the surface, everything has changed, but where, deep down, everything is basically the same . . . except it now comes with pierced belly-buttons.<br>For example, even Dr Greer would have to agree that toddling children still follow these rules I found at an unlikely Internet site run by a Russian intellectual.<br>Called Property laws of a toddler, they include:<br>1.If I like it, it's mine.<br>2.If it's in my hand, it's mine.<br>3.If I can take it from you, it's mine.<br>4.If I had it a little while ago, it's mine.<br>5.If it's mine, it must never appear to be yours in any way.<br>6.If I'm doing or building something, all of the pieces are mine.<br>7.If it looks like mine, it's mine.<br>8.If I saw it first, it's mine.<br>9.If you are playing with something and you put it down, it automatically becomes mine.<br>10.If it's broken, it's yours.<br></font></p>
