            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FILM<br>The Devil's Advocate (R)<br>Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves<br>Directed by Taylor Hackford<br>H H ½<br>THE Devil's Advocate leaves a deeply unsatisfying taste. It is like a grand smorgasbord of the finest food available, except that the barramundi is raw and the sushi deep-fried in batter.<br>A teaming of Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves appears irresistible, particularly when the subject matter is the ultimate in corruption - the devil's work.<br>The prospect of Pacino as the devil in a blue suit - that is not spoiling the surprise because even though this is revealed late in the film, it is bleeding obvious early on - is tantalising too.<br>But very little works to make The Devil's Advocate coherent or enjoyable. Sure there are many spectacles, both in acting and production. However, very few do anything for the film's sake. They appear to be included simply because they can be and for their own self-serving ends.<br>Such wasteful abuse, of special effects especially, is becoming endemic in the Hollywood sausage factory. This time, unfortunately, it has caught two excellent actors and a fine support cast in its brainless net.<br>An American reviewer, searching for words to describe his view of the film, apologised to readers for coming up with the tired Rosemary's Baby meets The Firm.<br>It is an accurate summary, though it needs to be emphasised that The Devil's Advocate has neither the hair-on-end horror of Rosemary's Baby nor the clean, neat, legal thrills of The Firm.<br>Rather it takes big chunks of both and hurls them willy-nilly into an unappetising broth.<br>At first, indeed for nearly its first hour, this is very watchable. Keanu Reeves is Kevin Lomax, a hot-shot young lawyer in deepest Florida who just can't lose even when he defends the indefensible, a child molester he knows to be guilty.<br>His brilliance attracts an offer he can't refuse - to be a lawyer for a huge corporation in New York, run by a sharp-talking smoothie called John Milton (Pacino in dashing form . . . at first).<br>Lomax and his sassy, sexy wife, Mary Ann (an eye-twinkling performance by Charlize Theron) don't refuse and they're off to Manhattan and all the sin and fun Milton's money can provide.<br>This includes a dazzling apartment housing Milton's loyal lieutenants and their shop-till-you-drop wives.<br>Mary Ann, who most wanted the high life, soon tires of interior decorating and shopping for swimsuits, and is mad to make a baby. The trouble is that Kevin is such a hot-shot he is never around for the baby-making and, in fact, has had his handsome head turned by a redhead genius lawyer (Connie Nielsen).<br>This straight tale explodes without meaning once it is established Kevin and Mary Ann are being torn apart. Mary Ann has occasional visions of grotesque monsters, she becomes pale and unwell, and all the time Kevin is achieving mighty deeds to the generous applause of Milton.<br>Pacino chooses this stage of the film to go ballistic. As I said it is no surprise he is the devil. But for the first hour at least it is a devil you love to watch, schmoozing with the common people, charming every woman in sight and just being a brilliant businessman. That's the devil we know, perhaps.<br>The one we don't want to know emerges so suddenly and without warning, it makes no sense at all.<br>Director Taylor Hackford allows Pacino full licence for eye-rolling, rubber-faced, yelling and lets him shout long, barely comprehensible speeches. Nothing gells, but everything looks fantastic as the evil is unleashed from the corporate heart.<br>The brainless assumption that the film is based on is that all lawyers are scumbags and thus we will accept without reason that Pacino's devil can cause the utmost chaos through control of them.<br>That might be acceptable pub joke material, but is no premise for a film that seems to want to say something, then ends in gibberish and flashy trash.<br>There are lovely special effects, though most make little narrative sense.<br>One that does is Kevin Lomax's seduction into John Milton's legal paradise. Production designer Bruno Rubeo has created the spectacular effect of a water garden in the sky, with pool surfaces spilling over the edges of a tall building so that water and sky seem to meet.<br>Milton's apartment is pretty cool, too, and seems just the place Satan would choose if he had a decorator.<br>Reeves keeps his head throughout and has the good luck to be the only cast member not required to go through the roof of theatricality.<br></font></p>
