            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GLOOM among Australia's one million Internet users deepened yesterday when it was learnt an electronic petition to the Senate, signed by more than 11,500 people against ?the death of the Net?, may be invalid.<br>Senate standing orders say that petitions must be accompanied by signatures, and this is usually taken to mean handwritten.<br>The petition, available on the World Wide Web since last Thursday, bears names and e-mail addresses.<br>It is a protest against the Federal Government allowing businesses to be time-charged for data calls - fax and modem - when Telstra is part-privatised after July 1.<br>The Senate passed the legislation last week, prompting an outcry among Internet users who say time-charging businesses will force many of the country's 470 Internet service providers to pass on increased costs to the public or close.<br>The World Wide Web petition - organised by the newly-formed Australian Internet Alliance and accompanied by a special page called The Death of the Internet - cannot hope to gather handwritten signatures.<br>The users who have put their names to the protest are spread throughout Australia. It is believed some are even from the United States.<br>Australian Democrats spokesman Graham Jenkin alerted Net users to the petition problems in an electronic newsgroup called aus.general.<br>However, it is believed Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja will try to put the petition to the Senate.<br>A concerned Net user e-mailed The West Australian yesterday, enclosing such a promise from her.<br>Mark Russell had asked for Senator Stott Despoja's help and she told him she would table the petition. She said she was unsure as to the rules regarding e-mailed petitions but would challenge them if there was a problem.<br>Daniel Clarke, of the Australian Internet Alliance, said its main aim was to show the Government that the public cared about timed calls, and was willing to do something about it.<br>Anger and disbelief at the legislation allowing local business data calls to be time-charged have been widespread on the Net for nearly a week.<br>Newsgroups and discussion mailing lists have run hot with criticism of the Government, saying the rapidly growing small businesses of ISPs will be killed off, home users will be forced off the medium because of price rises, and Telstra will dominate Net business.<br></font></p>
