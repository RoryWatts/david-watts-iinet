            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Most people would have bought their Christmas presents by now. Hands up those who haven't ? you're in trouble. But seriously one of the big gift dilemmas I've noticed is whether or not to connect to the Net.<br>In the past month about a dozen people, all parents of nine-to-13-year-olds have mentioned it. Mostly they are anxious and desperate for information.<br>It is not just the technical side of things. Many have walked into the minefield of modems, second lines and ISPs with trepidation after a year or so of watching their offspring teach them how to use Microsoft Encarta. ("No, mum, you've GOT to put the CD in. Not the Celine Dion one ? oh let me do it.?)<br>The bigger fear is the Net itself and what their children may find there. The Net as a popular medium is two years old at best. Constant media coverage has possibly removed the Geek-Nerd bias but it has not removed fears about pornography or bomb recipes.<br>These fears were uppermost in the minds of the parents I spoke to. To be honest, you have to tell them these things exist. To deny that would be foolish as well as negligent.<br>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that adult sites were the biggest money-spinners on the Web. Put a naked woman on your page and the punters flock with their credit cards.<br>Just last week I was reading movie reviews at Salon Magazine, one of the Web's most literate sites, and one of the films inspected was the bootleg video of Pamela Anderson Lee making love to her husband Tommy. It was not kids' stuff but at least it didn't give URLs where you could see parts of the video online.<br>A fortnight ago, I wrote of the apparition of a naked woman at the much-visited Telstra BigPond site. This, and anecdotal evidence of similar sightings, seems to mean that packets of data being viewed by some people at adult sites are leaking into proxy servers (think of them as giant caches for quicker Web access) at ISPs and momentarily distorting otherwise harmless surfing.<br>The last example of adult content is the only one which seems unpreventable. It is also so fleeting that I wonder if any damage could result from it.<br>Overall, if you think of the Net as a big city like Sydney, then you'll realise there is a sinful area called King's Cross. You don't have to go there if you don't want to and you certainly don't have to take the kids.<br>After two years of four hours a day on the Net, I would say the ratio of objectionable to unobjectionable content is 20-80 at worst, and more like 10-90.<br>Put it another way. If you've read a report saying bomb recipes are plentiful on the Net, substitute the word ?libraries? for Net.<br>If you've heard that porn is easily accessible on the Net, try the word ?bookstore? instead.<br>It is still amazing how misunderstood the Net is. Earlier this month, Reuters news agency did a survey of 1000 business people. The survey found:54 per cent of respondents admitted to getting a high when they found what they were looking for in a search engine such as Yahoo!;53 per cent said they have come to crave the kind of information they can find easily on the Net;46 per cent worried their children preferred computers to their peers.<br>It made the Net look like the drug of the 90s. But, as above, take the Net out of the equation.<br>Would you be shocked to discover researchers getting a kick out of finding what they seek? Alarmed to discover a desire for more information was increasing traffic at the library? Concerned that your child was spending too much time reading the encyclopaedia?<br>As Net commentator Jesse Berst of ZDNet Anchordesk said: ? ? because it involves the Internet, we might as well be talking about heroin.?<br>The Net is often painted hysterically as an evil place when, in fact, most of its material is available in the real world. The proviso always is that it is available if you are looking for it or are interested in it.<br>If you want the children on the Net, then it is parents, teachers and guardians who must be the main blocking software. They should be the ones who say where children can go and be on hand to explain things if they get out of hand.<br>The Net is basically an adult world that caters for supervised children. It is not a toy like Nintendo nor some de-facto baby-sitter like TV. And both those appliances are quite capable of warping young minds.<br>If you want your children on the Net - and the age is approaching where kids who are not exposed to it will be seen as deprived - then you have to be grown up about it and acknowledge your responsibilities.<br></font></p>
