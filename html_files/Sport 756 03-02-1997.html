            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE next person who says ?it's hot? will be shot under the stating-the-bleeding-obvious laws.<br>Yes, it has been hot. At The Vines it was hot enough to be able to drink several stubbies of the Heineken Classic's main sponsor's brew without pausing.<br>At the WACA Ground it has been so hot that only mad dogs, unlucky or unthinking people would sit out in the sun in those melt-your-bottom seats to watch the fifth Test between Australia and the West Indies.<br>The heat more than the dead rubber has kept the crowds away. One who admitted actually being silly enough to bask in the sun on Saturday was Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley.<br>In an amicable interview with Ian Chappell during the fading stages of Australia's Ambrose-affected first innings, the avuncular WA politician said he sat out in the open during the pre-lunch session.<br>Mr Beazley was not quite put in a hot seat by Chappelli's questioning, but was thrown when asked his opinion on the likelihood that the South Africa-Australia Tests would not be live on free-to-air TV. ?I didn't know that,? he exclaimed, promising that Communications Minister Senator Richard Alston would hear of his displeasure.<br>The story that pay-TV was likely to have rights to live play and free TV would get the crumbs has been around and reasonably prominent for days. Obviously, Mr Beazley has been taking a fair breather from his day job. And he certainly showed he was an avid and patriotic cricket supporter.<br>This hot Test has been engrossing. First Michael Bevan's gutsy 87 not out helped pull Australia from the brink.<br>Curtly Ambrose's swan song was electrifying, particularly as he took 5-43 while in obvious discomfort.<br>Shiv Chanderpaul's fast-thinking run-out of Mark Taylor, Sherwin Campbell's slip catch and Phil Simmons's miraculous juggling catch all made the match a feast.<br>And of course there was Brian Lara's cracking 132 which probably has put this Test in the Windies' pocket.<br>What a joy to watch such a flashing blade, quick reflexes and lightning eye. But why can't he save it for England, New Zealand or India?<br>The hot winds, so old wives' tales say, contribute to irritability and unpleasantness, not to mention argument.<br>There is a lot to argue about with the state of Australian cricket. Is Matt Hayden overrated? Is Justin Langer lucky to be in the team? Has Matthew Elliott's 78 retired hurt become so much part of mythology that he need do nothing more to retain an Australian cap?<br>Was Michael Slater, the most dashing batsmen we've had since Doug Walters in his young days, treated appallingly? Did Ricky Ponting deserve another chance? What is Paul Reiffel still doing in this side?<br>We agonise and yell about these things. But look at the scoreboard: Australia 3, West Indies 1 . . . until yesterday anyway.<br>Shouldn't we be a bit happy?<br></font></p>
