            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Internet may be replacing television as a home entertainment medium but the idiot box still supplies invaluable material for the World Wide Web.<br>One of those shows that could happen only in America is called Driveways of the Rich and Famous, which has had a strong cult following on cable TV for four years.<br>It also has its own Web site as a spin-off. And it is an amusing, entertaining and offbeat one, especially for those who do not take Tinsel Town glitter too seriously.<br>John Cunningham, mastermind of Driveways both on TV and the Web, takes a small video camera to prominent people's places and photographs their driveways.<br>Every now and then he bumps into the actual celebrity using their drive. Mostly he makes do interviewing delivery men, pool maintenance people, garbos and postmen.<br>The results are often fascinating. For example, he was stopped by security from venturing down Playboy boss Hugh Hefner's driveway. Security happened to be a voice coming from a big rock.<br>Cunningham interviewed the rock and got some candid insights.<br>He also found singer Trini Lopez washing his car and admitting he was a devoted fan.<br>Madonna was less kind but at least he got photos of her wheeling out of her drive on her bike.<br>The Driveways site features transcripts of many of the show's interviews plus dozens of stills of celebrity driveways.<br>If you have a hankering to see shots of drives leading to the homes of Andre Agassi, Marlon Brando, Geena Davis, Harrison Ford, Julia Roberts or many more, look no further.<br>Driveways of the Rich & Famous<br>http://www.driveways.com/<br></font></p>
