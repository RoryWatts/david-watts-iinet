            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Sending and receiving e-mail and browsing the World Wide Web are the most popular pursuits of people on the Net. In our January 27 issue, we revisited the basics of using e-mail.This week, we go back to basics with the world's most popular Web browsers - Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.<br>Browsers are our window on the World Wide Web of the Internet. New users soon learn that this window is by turns wonderful, weird or woeful. You can experience those highs and lows more enjoyably if you know how to get the best out of your browser.<br>This week we will worry about only the two big names: Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Browser-use statistics at several sites on the Web show the overwhelming majority of people use either Netscape Navigator 3 or 4 (which comes with the Communicator suite or on its own); or MSIE 3 or 4.MSIE 4 is designed to take over Windows but we will confine ourselves to its Web browsing ability.<br>In most cases, there is little difference between the basic functions in Navigator and IE for the Macintosh and the PC, so unless denoted, explanations apply to both platforms.<br>We won't talk about mail, newsgroup or chat functions or we would fill half the paper.<br>We will just look at straight browsing. And it is remarkable what a browser can see and do. They are designed primarily to read documents written in the Hyper-Text Markup Language format (or HTML).<br>However, they can also play video and audio clips, run animations, save programs to your hard drive, read a variety of word-processing formats, ditto with images.<br>There is much more to boot.<br>What follows is intended as a basic guide to how to drive your browser. Bear in mind there are at least two ways to do everything, so you may find better and faster ways to perform the same tasks.<br>Tool, button and navigation bars<br>The tool, navigation, or button bars - precise names vary between the big two - are what you use to get around and carry out most browsing functions.<br>In MSIE4, you can have up to five bars on screen: the button bar, address bar, status bar, favorites bar and explorer bar.<br>Navigator calls its bars the navigation and location bars - the status bar always appears at the bottom of the page. In Navigator/Communicator for the PC, you can also have a personal toolbar for your favourite sites.<br>At the top of each screen, you also have the standard pull-down menu similar to that used in apps such as word processors.<br>The navigation toolbar for Netscape or the standard/button bar for MSIE contain the back, forward, reload/refresh, stop, print and other buttons.Forward and back do pretty much just that - take you to the last page you visited. Be warned that in frames you may not get the last frame but a previous page.<br>The reload/refresh button is useful if your browser has stalled while downloading a page or in cases where the content of a page is being updated constantly (such as a Webcam site).Home will take you to the page you nominate as your start page (see section below).<br>Search takes you to a directory of search engines or, in IE, the engine you nominate (for Macs, you can change it where you also change your start page).<br>Move the bars to the position you want by grabbing them with the mouse. The standard layout is the navigation bar (back, forward, stop, etc) on top, followed by address/location bar, then perhaps a personal/favorites toolbar. Bars can be added and removed through the View button. We recommend using graphical toolbars until you are comfortable with Alt or Ctrl keys (Option or Command for Mac) and their functions.<br>In MSIE 4 for Win95, there is a Full-Screen function in which the browser window occupies almost the entire desktop with one small graphical toolbar at the top. Right-clicking here enables you to add or remove other elements of normal toolbars such as the address bar and the menu.<br>We recommend you always have the address window or location box visible so you can see the address of pages.<br>Navigator 3 toolbars can be dropped or added via the Options button.<br>If you don't like the way IE automatically completes an address as you type it in: eg, you may start typing www.yahoo.com and it automatically types www.yahoo.com/<br>entertainment/<br>music/artists -because you have been there before - turn off the auto-complete option. For Windows, it is under View, Internet Options, Advanced, Browsing, Use AutoComplete. For Mac users - look under Preferences, Web Browser, Browser Display, Toolbar Settings, Use Auto-Complete. You can manually select the auto-complete function when you have partially typed an address by clicking on the small arrow to the left of the address bar.<br>Start or home page<br>This is the page you see when you launch your browser. Typically, it will be from your Internet service provider's site, or it may be a Microsoft or Netscape page. You can make it whatever you like, be it a favourite search engine, your own Web page, a page from your hard disk or a blank.<br>Communicator: Edit, Preferences, Navigator. There are three checkboxes to choose from - blank page, home page or last page visited. If you select home page - type in the address of the page you want, eg, www.lycos.com<br>You can also click on the buttons for current page or browse (for a page stored on your hard disk - choose local file for Mac).<br>Navigator 3: Options, General Preferences, Appearance. You can select a blank page or type in a Web address.<br>MSIE 4: View, Internet Options, General. You can type an address or select the current page, a default or blank.<br>MSIE for Mac: Preferences, Web Browser, Home/Search. You can type in an address, choose to use none or use default (Microsoft). You can also choose whether or not this same page loads automatically each time you open a new window.<br>MSIE 3: View, Options, Navigation.?<br>Navigation and History<br>Communicator: If you have visited a dozen or so pages and want to get back to a particular one, click the back (or the forward) arrow on your navigation bar. Or click on the drop-down menu to the right of the location bar. The page names you have visited will be shown. Keep the button down and slide down to the one you want and release. Or select Go from the menu bar to see a list of sites.You can launch a new window showing a History of all sites visited over several days (though the Mac version doesn't show dates) by pressing the Control and H (Command-H keys for the Mac) keys together. Or click on Communicator in the menu bar and select History.Navigator: Select Go for a list of sites. To view History, use Ctrl-H (Windows only) or click on Window in the menu bar to select it.<br>MSIE: Use the backspace key (Windows only)to go back through sites one at a time, or view a selection by clicking on the narrow area next to either the back or forward arrows. In MSIE 4, you can see a History by clicking on the History button in the navigation bar (Windows only) or the History tab in the explorer bar. Also the list of sites will drop down as a new pane to the left.In MSIE 3, History is under the Go menu button. The history in IE is still superior to that of Navigator/<br>Communicator, particularly for Mac, because it can store several hundred places and does so in folders marked by date.In Windows browsers, you can see sites whose addresses you have typed recently by clicking on the down arrow next to the location box or address bar.If you have typed an address in the Netscape location box, you will need to click on the Web page before you you press Page Down or the down cursor arrow, or the previously typed address will be activated.In Netscape browsers, backspace operates like Page Up - going backwards through a document a screen at a time. In all browsers, the space bar is like Page Down.<br>Clicking on the Stop button or hitting the Esc (for escape) key will stop the page loading in all browsers - Java permitting (Java can be turned off via preferences).<br>To have more than one browser window open at a time, choose File, New Window from any browser. We don't recommend trying more than three or four at once or your connection will grind to a halt and your browser may crash.<br>Bookmarks/Favorites<br>If you see a page you like and want to return to it regularly, you can save it as a Bookmark (Netscape) or a Favorite (MSIE). Bookmarks are entered in a simple file called bookmark.htm but in Windows Favorites are individual entries in the Windows\Favorites folder and take much more space. Netscape bookmarks can be imported effortlessly into MSIE by typing the address where bookmark.htm resides in the Address window and then clicking Favorites, Add to Favorites. The opposite operation - Favorites to Bookmarks - requires a special conversion program such as Bookmark Importer Lite or MSIE Converter.<br>Mac users can import Bookmarks or Favorites easily by selecting File, Import when the Bookmarks/Favorites are open on screen.<br>Communicator/Navigator: With the page on screen, hit Ctrl-D (or Command-D for Macs), or select the Bookmarks button from under the navigation bar (next to where you type your URLs), then hit either Add or File (in Communicator only) to put it in a folder you have created. Right-clicking the mouse while viewing the page enables you to add it as a Bookmark too. For Macs, double-clicking on the single bookmark icon or selecting Bookmarks, Add Bookmark also works.<br>From Communicator's Bookmarks button, go Edit, Bookmarks to organise them. On the simple screen showing all entries, you can right-click the mouse on a selection to create sub-folders, rename pages, delete entries or check whether sites have been updated.<br>Under Navigator, bring up the Bookmarks screen under the Navigator, Bookmarks menu (or Command-B) and then you can drag and drop Bookmarks between folders.<br>In Communicator for the PC, you can drag the icon next to the Location bar on to a personal toolbar for a fast bookmark. You will need to go to Edit, Bookmarks to manipulate it under the Personal Toolbar Folder entry.<br>MSIE: Right-click (click and hold for Mac) the mouse and choose Add to Favorites. The dialogue box enables you to rename the page and/or create the selection to a different folder (Windows only). Or select Favorites menu from the toolbar menu and choose Add to Favorites.When you choose Organise Favorites from the toolbar menu (Windows only), you are presented with a Windows Explorer-type menu which enables you to drag and drop selections to different folders, create new folders, rename entries or delete them.In MSIE 4 (for Windows), selecting the Favorites folder icon in the toolbar will launch a new pane on the left of screen (like a frame).<br>Click the icon next to the Address window and drag it on to the Links toolbar for quick Favorites. You can create shortcuts from this bar to folders and applications in MSIE 4. Right-clicking on the entry on the bar will enable you to manipulate it. Or you can go to Organise Favorites where these entries are in the Links folder.<br>For Macintosh, you can open the Favorites window by clicking on the folder in the toolbar or by using Favorites, Open Favorites (Command-J). Command-K enables you to manually create a Favorite. You can create new folders and dividers from the Favorites menu.<br>Cache<br>The cache is a directory where copies of all the elements from a browsing session are entered automatically to enable faster retrieval of sites. It is the reason your hard disk is a bit fuller after a heavy session. Instead of connecting to another computer or network, you are fetching the page from your own disk. To get the latest page from the Web - instead of your disk - hit F5 or Refresh in MSIE, or Ctrl-R or Reload in Netscape (Command-R for the Mac for either browser).<br>Caches enable you to surf offline with Communicator and MSIE 4 if you select File, Offline option. Pages will respond to normal Web addresses if they are available in the cache.<br>Communicator: Cache settings and buttons enabling you to clear it - it can become clogged or corrupted - are available from Edit, Preferences, Advanced, Cache.<br>Navigator: Options, Network Preferences, Cache.<br>MSIE 4: View, Internet Options, General (under Temporary Internet Files). Go to Preferences, Web Browser, Advanced for the Mac.<br>MSIE 3: View, Options, Advanced<br>It's a good idea to set your cache to around 5Mb and allow it to clear once per session. If it is too big, it will slow down your computer and if the cache isn't cleared regularly you may not be seeing up-to-date pages.<br>Saving<br>All browsers: To save a page to your disk, go to File, Save As. This will save the page without images and enables you to recall it quickly or to check and edit the HTML coding (use View, Source at any time to check HTML). To save an image, right-click (or click and hold on Mac) on it and select Save Image. In IE4 for the Mac, you can save the whole page - images, tables, the lot - by choosing Save As Web Archive instead of HTML or text.<br>Images<br>They can be turned off so you load only text, often halving download time. The result can be some pages where links are not apparent, particularly pages that use image maps (images that have a number of ?hot spots? that link to different pages).<br>Communicator: Go to Edit, Preferences, Advanced and click on Automatically Load Images so there is no tick. You can force images to load using the image button in the toolbar.<br>Navigator: Options and click on Auto Load Images to remove the tick.<br>MSIE 4: View, Internet Options, Advanced and go to the section marked Multimedia and click the box next to Show Pictures so there is no tick. For Mac - Preferences, Web Browser, Web Content , Show pictures<br>MSIE 3: View, Options, General (remove Show Pictures tick)<br>You can also turn off video, sound and Java so sites download quickly, with less chance of crashing your browser.<br>HELP DESK<br>Bookmark Converters for Windows 95: tucows.iinet.net.au/bookmark95.html<br>or www.windows95.com/apps/url.html<br>Netscape: home.netscape.com or www.netscape.com.au<br>MSIE: www.microsoft.com/ie/<br>Dozens of browser tips: www.download.com/Browsers/0,145,207-0,201000.html<br>Webster: www.websterpublishing.com/explrw95.htm<br></font></p>
