            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ENOUGH with the Whitmans airship already.<br>The yellow blimp is a good advertisement for chocolates and occasionally adds new dimensions to sport coverage on TV. It has been successful for Channel 10 at the spring racing carnival and Nine at the Australian Grand Prix and national lifesaving titles.<br>It did nothing, however, for Seven's live telecast of the Eagles' brilliant demolition of Brisbane at the Gabba on Sunday.<br>The blimp intruded on the coverage in the first half, giving viewers airsickness instead of what was a tight contest at that time.<br>Watching football from this high takes away any human scale. It reduces the players to dots on a green background and forces viewers to imagine where the ball is. Instead of defining the complicated match-ups, confrontations and off-the-ball action, it distorts them.<br>No doubt blimp coverage is an attempt to bring football's true nature to screen, which is a big ask. Anybody who goes to a real game knows a match is far more than what happens around the ball carrier.<br>John Worsfold is a case in point. The Eagles captain imposes himself on a game with constant needling of opponents and brutal shepherding. Only a small amount of this vital part of the game actually goes to air.<br>The interaction between forwards and defenders in the goal-square when the ball is at the other end of the field is another important part of the game that can get only scant camera attention, yet it can be a clincher.<br>At Subiaco last year, Eagle Jason Ball put the usually efficient Mick Martyn, of North Melbourne, right off his game. Ball stood on Martyn's toes at one time, protesting his innocence. Martyn was incensed and seemed ineffective. Ball had a ripper and the Eagles romped home.<br>But back to the blimp. It blew away in the second half about the same time as the Eagles blew away poor Brisbane.<br>The manner of the 79-point win was best epitomised by the man West Australians allegedly love to hate, expert commentator Don Scott. ?Ah put the little leaguers back on, Brisbane's given this away,? he said about halfway through the final term as Chris Lewis waltzed unopposed into an open goal.<br>?This is poetry in motion,? he mused, almost in a trance, soon after Lewis again goaled after a series of perfect passes made possible by fearless defence from Peter Matera and Guy McKenna.<br>The sight of Lewis with all the time in the world, unruffled, calm and purposeful was indeed poetic and a highlight.<br>Lewis' poise, Fraser Gehrig's erratic flair and Ben Cousins' fighting endeavour could not be captured by pictures from the blimp, though the goal-mouth to centre-square kick-ins of Ashley McIntosh and Guy McKenna (marked with one hand by Glen Jakovich) looked exceptional from on high.<br>Perhaps the blimp might give interesting aerial shots from the Ashes Test at Lord's next month. In that case it should leave now. As Peter Landy told us, it takes 12 days to float from Brisbane to Melbourne.<br>?BEST line of the week came from Trevor Marmalade on Nine's Footy Show.?Richmond and Collingwood are going to merge,? he said, ?they'll be called the Tiger Woods.?<br></font></p>
