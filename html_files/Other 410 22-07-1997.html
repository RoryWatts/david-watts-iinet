            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">People talk about the weather all the time. The Web gives them the chance to be better informed in their small talk.<br>The Perth Bureau of Meteorology, like its counterparts in other States, lays claim to one of the least glamorous Web sites of all. It is an old-fashioned gopher site. Gopher is a software tool predating the Web which enables you to search for files using a text-based interface.<br>The Perth site is packed withup-to-date information.<br>The official forecasts, climate trends and satellite maps available at the site can make the user as well informed as the ABC's Michael Schultz or Ten's John Barnett.<br>Travellers or those who just have to know the forecast for Test cricket venues, for example, have a wide choice of global weather pages.<br>Yahoo is as comprehensive with weather as it is with every other subject it touches.<br>Its forecasts, from Weathernews Inc, are presented with neat graphics predicting clouds, showers, rain, snow and sunshine.<br>Users can also see satellite pictures from dozens of locations, or download short MPEG movies taken from the weather satellites.<br>Intellicast offers the most graphic forecasts. They are not always as up to date as they might be, however.<br>The US site is predictably America-oriented, but its world section has an attractive and easily followed format of clickable maps.<br>HELP DESK<br>Bureau of Meteorology: gopher://babel.ho.bom.gov.au<br>Yahoo weather: weather.yahoo.com<br>Intellicast: www.intellicast.com<br>(pictured left)<br></font></p>
