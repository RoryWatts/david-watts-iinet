            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A little corner of the Internet is bloke heaven. Women Netizens or cybergrrls might say the Net is entirely blokey - and they're not going to stand for it.<br>Granted, a lot of the World Wide Web is testosterone-fuelled. This is changing, however, as the 90-10 male-female ratio of early 1995 becomes the 65-35 proportion of the present day.<br>But back to this particular bloke heaven. It is just like a pub, rowdy, humorous and even violent at times. All anyone talks about is footy, dinkum Australian Rules, not any of those other games.<br>They talk about it to the exclusion of other blokey topics such as Sam Fox, politics or even cricket. They talk from every footy-loving corner of Australia, and every now and then from the footy-starved third world of Oklahoma or Copenhagen or Jerusalem.<br>The forum is rec.sport.football.australian. It is a Usenet newsgroup. Like the other 20,000 or so newsgroups on the Net it consists of people posting their innermost convictions in an e-mail, then standing back and watching it explode in a conflagration of counterpoint, reasoned argument and plain old abuse.<br>rec.sport.football.australian is never quiet. In the summer months the talk is of the draft, injuries and coach-sacking.<br>Come winter it attracts more than 50 fresh postings a day - full-on discussions that make Channel 9's Footy Show look like a pre-school, and a pre-school for well mannered little girls at that.<br>The subject headers, or threads, on the postings give a small indication of the passion within. Last time I looked the list included: Eagles thrashed (losers), Crows suck, stupidest comment of the year, was we robbed?, and Saints rule.<br>Mixed in with that lot are polite questions such as what is the most common surname in the AFL and which club has the most members.<br>Then there are the statistics. Certain posters seem to spend every waking hour calculating kicks, marks, handballs, the ratio of goals to behinds, the interstate ability of clubs and any other footy trait that can be reduced to figures.<br>Now look at the way the blokes (very few women in this newsgroup) talk about certain topics. Here is an edited sample after Richmond thrashed West Coast: ?Oh life is good. If only I could see (expletive deleted) Malthouse's face after a crushing defeat by the mighty Tigers.?<br>One response: ?Were you one of the "supporters' who booed off your Mighty Tigers at half time only a couple of weeks ago??<br>One polite posting sought to summarise the season at the end of round seven in an attempt to work out who would be premiers. It was a reasoned and thoughtful correspondence and attracted this response: ?Hawthorn will be the other half of the grand final and we will WIN.?<br>A Fremantle Dockers supporter chimed in: ?I think it was a serious question.?<br>The obvious point to be made is: who is kidding whom?<br>HELP DESK<br>Thread: The subject of an e-mail to a newsgroup. People can choose to follow a particular thread or start a new one.<br>Good footy sites:<br>160 links www.ozemail.com.au/statware/<br>statlink.html<br>Ultimate Australian Rules www.odyssey.com.au/sports/afl.html<br>Official sites:<br>Westar Rules www.iinet.net.au/wafl/westar.html<br>AFL www.afl.com.au<br></font></p>
