            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IF YOU doubted the grip that television has on the AFL competition, consider the evidence that mounted during the past week:<br>?Hawthorn superstar Jason Dunstall used his Wednesday night program Live and Kicking to announce his retirement.<br>Viewers were told before the great goalkicker confided in his own teammates. Dunstall is on record as saying he regretted having to do it that way, but he had a new career to think about.<br>?Channel 7 commentators constantly referred to Essendon captain James Hird as ?James? during the replay of Geelong's surprise victory over the Bombers on Saturday. Hird is one of Dunstall's chief partners in crime on Live and Kicking.<br>?Leigh Matthews was the analyst in the Channel 7 box for the Brisbane-St Kilda game at the Gabba, a match seen here in the early hours of Sunday.<br>Matthews, as hot tip to coach Brisbane next year, was his astute self but spent a lot of time assessing the men who will possibly be his future charges.<br>For example, ?I like the look of that Simon Black?, or ?Curious to have last year's backline up forward now?.<br>The last weekend of the home and away season was a rich blessing not only for Seven, but for football followers generally.<br>Despite the showings of the Dockers and Eagles, it was impossible not to appreciate the drama of the games that shaped the final eight, and the theatre of those that farewelled old stagers and unhappy coaches.<br>At Subiaco on Saturday night, the Eagles might have failed to make a nailbiter of it with Adelaide, but very few of the 36,000 crowd left early. The drama was not the hope of an impossible return from the dead by the Eagles, but the very mathematical drama of getting the right percentage to stay in the finals.<br>Most seemed to know the equation - Adelaide win by 38 points or more and the Eagles drop to ninth.<br>So as Tony Modra booted almost identical goals midway through the final term, the Eagles fans held their collective breath and warmly welcomed Ashley McIntosh back to the job on the accurate Crow.<br>They almost sighed with relief when Fraser Gehrig partially atoned for his earlier slowness against Modra by wobbling the last goal through to keep the margin at a respectable 25 points.<br>This mathematical face of football was also on show during the ABC's telecast of the vital Westar Rules clash between Claremont and West Perth on Saturday.<br>The camera spent more time focusing on Glenn Mitchell at work on his calculator than on the ground in the final quarter.<br>The Falcons booted away by three goals, and with each new goal or point, Wally Foreman intoned Claremont's new percentage compared with East Perth's.<br>The Tigers just missed a finals berth, but who's to say the drama of the figures was any less a piece of theatre than Jeff Farmer's amazing mark in the first quarter of the Melbourne-Richmond match at the MCG on Sunday.<br></font></p>
