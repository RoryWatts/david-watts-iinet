            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>The Craft (MA)<br>Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell<br>Directed by Andrew Flemming<br>THE Craft obviously sets out to be a horror film full of thrills. It fails to cast a spell but it is worth a look for the acting, some humour and occasionally the special effects.<br>This latest Hollywood teen schlocker could well have stayed in the can. It provides some campy moments but lacks the intelligence and wit to compete with other films about witchcraft and the supernatural such as Rosemary's Baby, the Exorcist, the Witches of Eastwick or even Roald Dahl's very funny Witches.<br>The image it leaves is not one of tantalising scariness, but loathing for Californian teenagers with perfect teeth and the latest Gothic accessories ... dog collars, pierced noses and constant sneers.<br>No one is worth caring about. The entire cast of characters is nearly always mean and out for what they can get. A good film has got to have someone to cheer for. It is not much fun hissing everyone.<br>And hissing there is in spades in The Craft, with the screen full of snakes and crawly things in some sequences.<br>For a moment the viewer might empathise with the heroine Sarah (Robin Tunney), an unhappy teen who moves from San Francisco to LA after a suicide attempt.<br>She and her family move into a mansion that has creepy written all over it. In fact it is so obviously a house of horrors one wonders why doting daddy bought it.<br>Sarah goes to a classy school where uniforms are worn ... very unAmerican. As she starts her school days, the uniforms of her classmates look pristine. But as the film unravels, so do the tartan skirts, white blouses and ties, so that by the end everyone looks like the cast of Rocky Horror.<br>At school Sarah crosses paths with the so-called ?bitches of Eastwick?. Two seem to be quite lovely, Bonnie (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True).<br>The third is a shocker and probably the overacting star of the show. Nancy (Fairuza Balk) is Gothic right to her weirdly coloured cats' eyes. She smokes in the playground and sneers at everyone. She is plain bad.<br>And Sarah is plain good as the four discover they are a quartet who can make supernatural things happen.<br>The campy coven then sets out to solve the problems of the world ... well their manifest personal problems actually.<br>Sarah gets a boy to fall in love with her, Rochelle causes a blonde ?Barbie? who has been racially taunting her to lose all her hair ... oh the horror ... and Bonnie invokes the spirits to clean away her dreadful burn scars.<br>Nancy goes for the lot and asks the spirit (apparently more powerful than God and the devil) to fill her and is able to cause her abusive stepfather to die of a heart attack and leave her and her Connie Francis-loving, alcoholic mum $175,000.<br>Sarah recognises the danger of all this as the spells work too well with fatal consequences, and she and Nancy are on a collision course of good witch versus bad witch.<br>The campy special effects of telekinesis and levitation, plus the constantly evil shine from Nancy's eyes are more laugh-provoking than scary as this battle heats up.<br>The Craft never had a chance with this shallow plot and lack of imagination. Overdone special effects do not help either.<br>But the four lead performances from the young actors are good.<br></font></p>
