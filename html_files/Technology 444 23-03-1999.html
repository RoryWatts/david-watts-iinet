            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Federal Government's proposed Internet censorship regime will cripple the speed of the Internet in Australia, experts have warned.<br>Michael Malone, chairman of the WA Internet Industry Association and head of a big Perth Internet service provider, said the proposals had him a little distressed, and had set the discussion about Internet content back three years.<br>At the core of the regime proposal by Communications Minister Richard Alston is a bid to block access to material that is either illegal, refused classification or X-rated in other media such as films and TV.<br>R-rated material on the Net would only be available to those over 18 through use of a system of identification with personal identification numbers (PINs) or credit cards.<br>Under the plan, online service providers must remove highly offensive or illegal material from their services once they have been notified of its existence by the Australian Broadcasting Authority.<br>Members of the public who spot offensive Internet content will be told to contact the ABA, and a community-industry body will monitor online material, advise about the complaints mechanism, and provide community education and information.<br>If the content originates overseas, the ABA will notify the police who will refer it to overseas enforcement agencies.<br>But the proposal that has ISPs worried is the prospect the ABA will ask them to block a site which they do not host. This will require expensive, fast proxy servers that must screen every address and compare it with a list of banned sites in response to users requesting Internet content.<br>Mr Malone said one company in Queensland had put together a list of 8.5 million sites that would be banned under the new regime.<br>If every time users requested an Internet site the address had to be compared with a list of 8.5 million names, their access speed would be dramatically reduced, Mr Malone said.<br>?It is simply impractical and it won't work anyway,? Mr Malone said.<br>?There are thousands of new sites every year, pornographic sites not in the proxy lists will still reach children.? A CSIRO report on blocking Internet content found last year that any blocking methods could easily be bypassed.<br>The only practical solution to protect children was parental supervision, perhaps linked with programs such as Net Snitch or Kidz Net, Mr Malone said.<br>Senator Alston said on Sydney radio last week there was widespread community concern about Internet content. He said snuff movies, paedophile lists and bomb recipes were all available online for those who knew where to find them.<br>Senator Alston said the Government wanted to get on top of Australian sites, but admitted it would be more difficult to control international sites.<br>?But we do believe that the rapid pace of technology is going to provide means for addressing the problem. We will have codes of practice that will require action to be taken, all reasonable steps to try and ensure that the Internet is as safe as possible,? Senator Alston said.<br>?We don't want to put responsibilities on those who don't have control over what goes across the Internet.?<br>Mr Malone said he was very disappointed with the Internet Industry Association, which worked on the new code of conduct with the Government.<br>Last Friday, IIA executive director Peter Coroneos said the proposed code of conduct was a balanced solution.<br>?We have to be mindful that the community has set limits,? he said.<br>?ISPs are not censors or Net police but they should be responsive when the authority makes a determination (about inappropriate content).?<br>Alston's plan<br>?X-rated and offensive R-rated material banned.<br>?ABA will determine exactly which sites are to be banned.<br>?Providers of illegal or banned content in Australia will be targeted directly.<br>?Illegal or banned content providers overseas will be targeted via overseas enforcement authorities.<br>?Local ISPs will be asked to block access to any site determined to contain illegal or banned material.<br>The objections<br>?Material now legally viewed by adults would be made illegal.<br>?Any filtering mechanism will significantly slow Internet access.<br>?Filtering mechanisms are ineffective in preventing access to unwanted material.<br>?ISPs are being made responsible for material they have no control over.<br>?The plan will hamper the growth of e-commerce in Australia.<br></font></p>
