            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Federal Government's second Online Australia Day has provoked wildly different views about the state of the Internet in this country.<br>Communications Minister Richard Alston said the day showed Australia was developing a vibrant online economy and community.<br>But Roger Clarke, an e-commerce consultant and visiting fellow at the Australian National University, used the day to launch a series of attacks on the Government's online policies.<br>He claimed at a Web site set up as a ?state of the e-nation? report that the Government had botched its responsibilities.<br>In a summary of 10 points of criticism, Mr Clarke said:<br>?Positive things the Government was doing were moving at glacial pace.<br>?It had failed to act in many vital areas.<br>?But in the regulatory arena it was making every available mistake ?as quickly as possible?.<br>Online Australia Day was held on November 26 with its focus point a Web site that Senator Alston said attracted 1.7 million hits. The day was designed to raise community awareness about the employment, business, social, educational and entertainment opportunities on the Net.<br>Mr Clarke used the first online day last year to issue an upbeat assessment of Australia's Net future.<br>But this year he said: ?I'm downcast, because the Commonwealth Government is making a complete botch of its responsibilities.?<br>Among his concerns this year were:<br>?The Electronic Transactions Bill 1999 covering evidence and signatures would not operate until mid-2001.<br>?The Privacy Protection (Private Sector) Bill still had not been introduced. It was also unlikely to provide real protection required for public confidence in e-commerce.<br>?The Government Public Key Authority had failed to build privacy protections into the public key infrastructure.<br>? Australia's overseas connectivity was inadequate with ?woeful bandwidth and tortuous paths? to Asian trade partners.<br>?Prices for connections and traffic were exorbitant compared with the US and Canada.<br>?ISDN was so expensive that it was hardly used.<br>?Cable passed about 2 million mainly affluent people, yet competitive Net access via cable was unavailable.<br>?The censorship regime was based on technical ignorance, and would be intrusive, ineffective and costly.<br>Senator Alston's assessment of the Net, based on the experience of online day, was significantly upbeat, by comparison.<br>He said that a survey run in conjunction with the day found that Australians stranded on a desert island would prefer to have a computer with Net access than a television or a mobile phone.<br>?The survey also found that nearly 70 per cent of respondents would now much rather give someone they had just met their e-mail address than their telephone number,? he said.<br>He hailed online day as a big success, saying that the 1.7 million hits showed that more families were discovering what the Net had to offer.<br>Help Desk<br>Online Australia Day:<br>www.onlineaustralia.net.au<br>State of the E-Nation report:<br>www.anu.edu.au/people/<br>Roger.Clarke/II/OLADay99.html<br></font></p>
