            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Now and Then (PG)<br>Christina Ricci, Demi Moore<br>Rosie O'Donnell<br>Directed by Lesli Linka Glatter<br>???<br>THE only reason Now and Then misses a four-star rating is its lack of mass appeal. It is unashamedly a women's and girls' film. Nothing wrong with that - unless you happened to be one of the five males among about 100 women and girls (average age 14) at the screening I saw with my daughter at the weekend.<br>The girls (and this included the smattering of grandmothers and mothers) were there mostly in groups of four - like the stars of Now and Then. It was impossible to hear a Jaffa crunch before the main feature, such was the chatter. Groups of girls stood and nattered so much it was tempting to shout - Shut Up, Sit Down!<br>But of course a male voice would have either been ignored, unheard or, worse, identified and its owner strung up.<br>The girls quietened down when chain-smoking, nervous Demi Moore got the action under way on screen.<br>Now and Then is wafer-thin and insubstantial as far as plot goes but is a lovely acting tour de force by four youngsters who outshine the grown-ups with stellar energy.<br>It also is a lovely film about friendship and seeking some meaning outside the cramped quarters of comfortable suburbia.<br>Much is made in the publicity and hype surrounding Now and Then of the presence of big stars Moore (who produced), Rosie O'Donnell and Melanie Griffith.<br>They contribute little and are on screen for less than 20 per cent of the time. And that 20 per cent is by far the least convincing part of Now and Then. The Then is terrific, not just for its 1970 soundtrack (Band of Gold by Aretha Franklin etc.), its evocation of sunny, innocent summer suburbia, but for its introduction of three young actors who could have big careers ahead of them.<br>I say three, because of the four girls one is already extremely substantial.<br>Christina Ricci, who outshone Winona Ryder in Mermaids and outplayed Anjelica Huston in The Adams Family films, is on song as the tomboy Roberta.<br>Her friends are the bookworm Samantha (Gaby Hoffmann), suffering the trauma of a broken home, the would-be sex siren Tina (Thora Birch) and the oh-so-girly-in-pink, naive Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore) ... who believes kissing can cause pregnancy.<br>They are 12. It is 1970. An innocent America is starting to discover the horror of Vietnam and all the girls want is a tree house to themselves.<br>These young lives are put under the microscope, their discoveries, yearnings and plans hung out like dainty washing in the stiff breeze of reality.<br>That reality is the discovery that life can do unexpected and unkind things. Roberta's mother died peacefully in her sleep when Roberta was four, she was told.<br>But the horrible truth of painful death is revealed in a newspaper clipping the girls find as they try to unravel the 25-year mystery of the death of a 12-year-old boy called Little Johnny, whose spirit they try to awaken in a graveyard seance.<br>Despite the message that you never know what to expect out of life, Now and Then has stage-managed the characters of the four girls so much that their appearance as adults 20 years later, when they reunite for the birth of Chrissy's first child, is so unsurprising as to be bland in the extreme and almost fodder for the cutting-room floor.<br>Sexy Tina grows up to be incredibly sexy Melanie Griffith, gorgeous in tight, short skirt. Thoughtful, slightly wacky Samantha becomes nervous, brooding Demi Moore. And silly, girly Chrissy becomes wowserish, silly, girly suburban drone Rita Wilson.<br>The one shock is that slim, reedy Roberta becomes shorter and fatter Rosie O'Donnell. Her tomboy toughness prevails, however.<br>The excuse for shoving in the Now part of the film - as bookends at the beginning and end - can only be to get the name stars. It does little for a quietly funny and thoughtful film.<br></font></p>
