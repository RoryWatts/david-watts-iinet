            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THERE is plenty of football finals action on the World Wide Web.<br>Melbourne radio station 3AW - home of Rex Hunt and Sam Newman - has real audio broadcasts of finals action at the Club 10 World site, run through Foxtel.<br>The Ultimate Australian Rules site runs results, club logos and features dozens of downloadable pictures of players and some of the greatest marks of the past 10 years.<br>For pure diversity of choice, 70 Footy Sites allows fans access to club pages, official and unofficial, and basically anything that comes under the Australian football umbrella.<br>???<br>THE Internet has evolved its own rules and sanctions which reflect its technological and social realities in a way alternatives imposed from outside cannot.<br>So says Electronic Frontiers Australia spokesman Daniel Yee at a site devoted to the thorny issue of Net censorship.<br>In the text of a speech he gave recently, Mr Yee - a prominent fighter against NSW's failed Net censorship bid earlier this year - puts a strong case for users and not governments making their own rules in cyberspace.<br>?Governments didn't build the Internet, they don't own it, and they can't control it; they will have to learn to live with this,? he says.<br>???<br>VETERAN US magazine editor and TV producer-turned Web consultant Jerry Lazar has set out what he claims are the top blunders made by commercial Web sites.<br>Mr Lazar has sought opinions from Web consultants around the world in compiling his list.<br>Among the blunders are:<br>?Rushing in without a master plan. Companies are so dazzled by the prospect of establishing a Web presence that they lose sight of the original reasons for being there.<br>?Appointing the wrong person to the task. In too many corporate boardrooms, this week's VP of New Media is last week's marketing director who has never ventured past e-mail.<br>?Being too commercial. Internet protocol dictates that you supply free information and entertainment first, and then ask for the sale.<br>?Using unnecessarily big graphics. The single most frequently heard complaint is that hefty graphics take way too long to download.<br>URLs<br>Club 10 - www.Club10.com.au/indexn.html<br>Ultimate Australian Rules - www.odyssey.com.au/sports/afl.html<br>70 Footy Sites - www.ozemail.com.au/-statware/statlink.html<br>Danny Yee's speech - www.anatomy.su.oz.au/danny/efa/APCspeech.html<br>OS/2 - www.iinet.net.au/~summer/<br>Windows 95 - www.wantree.com.au/-hansie<br>Common blunders - www.gigaplex.com/10top/10blund.htm<br></font></p>
