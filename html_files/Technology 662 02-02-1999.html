            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TWO developments in the past fortnight have had traditional computer and Net users fuming.<br>I say traditional because they seem the type of people who regard the Net as a medium which guarantees freedom of access and information, rather than a freedom to cash in, which is currently overshadowing technology and Net-related news.<br>The first development concerns Microsoft and beta testing of its Office 2000 suite of software.<br>A correspondent in a Perth newsgroup raised the alarm here when he recently posted a news item written in Windows Update magazine by news editor Kathy Ivens.<br>Ms Ivens described Office 2000's registration process as ?less than enchanting?, which is already understatement-of-the-year material.<br>To combat software piracy, Microsoft has introduced enforced registration.<br>The registration function lets a user launch the software 50 times without registration before it shuts down.<br>As Ms Ivens says: ?After that, it's over. You can't use your software. You paid for it, you own it, but you can't use it. I hate this. If I pay for a product, I want to be able to use it.?<br>Her argument was that the decision to register is totally up to the user ... not Microsoft.<br>She objected to entering her name and address on a form, an action she said almost guaranteed junk mail.<br>Ms Ivens also rejected arguments that she had bought a licence, not a product, by likening enforced registration to making it compulsory for someone else to start your new car.<br>The enforced process writes registration information back to your system and checks this when an attempt is made to launch the software.<br>?The information is based on several elements, including data taken from the system hardware. If you change hardware, you eliminate the validity of your registration,? she wrote.<br>?Hello? Has no hard disk ever died at Microsoft? Has nobody ever upgraded to a bigger, faster computer??<br>And, she says, if you can't register over the Net, you can register by phone - but only during normal business hours at Redmond, in Seattle. Office hours there would be between 1am and 9am in WA.<br>The second upsetting development was the enforced closure of the popular Web site Lyrics.com.<br>The International Lyrics Server, a site containing the words to more than 100,000 songs, was closed after music publishers accused the Swiss-based operators of copyright violations.<br>Police seized computers used to serve the site and a prosecutor confirmed that a criminal investigation was under way.<br>Lyrics.com received about one million hits a day from 100,000 people seeking the words to popular songs, according to Pascal de Vries, a network consultant in Basle who founded the site in February 1997.<br>Complaints about the freedom to obtain lryics were made on behalf of Warner/Chappell Music Inc, Polygram Music Publishing Inc and six other music-publishing companies. They all claimed they were losing money because people were downloading lyrics instead of buying sheet music.<br>Lyrics.com gets its lyrics from Net users themselves. It, like the Internet Movie Database, asks people to pool their knowledge.<br>Surfers at Lyrics.com contributed between 200 and 300 songs a day.<br>Reaction to this heavy-handed use of authority has been almost universal.<br>Help Desk<br>Lyrics.com: www.lyrics.com<br></font></p>
