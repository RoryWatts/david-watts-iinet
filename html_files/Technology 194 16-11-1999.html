            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I SAW two versions of the future at the weekend. One froze my home computer and one logged me off after 15 minutes of playing with a few miserly paragraphs.<br>It is what you come to expect when you have too much idle time on your hands and a tool as powerful as the Web.<br>It is also further evidence home Net users do not necessarily have the gear to handle the rapid developments that technology companies have in mind.<br>But that in no way rules out the potential of the two sites I was playing with.<br>The one that froze my PC was Desktop.com.<br>It is trying to provide a graphical Webtop that lets users launch applications or games and install links to favourite sites.<br>I don't know what to make of it because it clearly needs a bit more grunt than my Pentium 133 can deliver at 28.8kbps. Those with more firepower might be luckier.<br>The site that gave me more pleasure was a European one run by ESoft which lets users take part in a demonstration of Microsoft Office 2000 delivered over the Web.<br>Instead of installing the suite of programs on your hard drive via a CD, the site hosts them and lets people use them across a Net connection.<br>At 28.8k it's a little like wading thigh-deep through treacle. The cursor and menus respond about a second after activation and you wait for the words to arrive on screen long after they have left your brain via the keyboard.<br>Yet it can be done. It's crystal radio-like in much the same way as watching RealPlayer streaming video or listening to live audio over many Web sites.<br>Microsoft is keen for this type of online Office to succeed.<br>The empire of Bill Gates was determined to get on with its aggressive life last week in the wake of Judge Jackson's monopoly findings and Office online was one of two major new thrusts announced.<br>The other was the alliance with Radioshack-Tandy stores so it could use real world business space to haul back the huge lead that America Online has in virtual world custom (latest score: AOL 20 million customers, Microsoft's MSN 2 million).<br>Office online also represents a bid to ward off the inroads expected from Sun's StarOffice suite that power-laden users can download free. Even the less powerful can order the Office rival on CD for about $60, or considerably less than MS Office.<br>I N A delightful bit of irony it is Microsoft that is trying to lure the business-user market with a technique advocated by Sun boss Scott McNealy - the sacrifice of personal computer space for Net-delivered applications.<br>Although Office online's target is business and corporate networks, and ESoft's Managed Internet Applications is fired up at the potential for global portability of computer work, it is no barrier to we mortals.<br>ESoft's demo of Office 2000 online, with all its problems of congestion and delays, still points to the type of Net-managed business that is going to be possible soon.<br>Have a go and peek into the future at the same time.<br>Helpdesk<br>Desktop.com:<br>www.desktop.com<br>ESoft Office online demo:<br>www.mia-global.com<br>Sun StarOffice: www.sun.com/<br>products/staroffice/get.cgi<br></font></p>
