            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Access boss Sue Yeap - she who must be obeyed - inspired me. In her NetChic column last week, Sue referred to AltaVista's latest Web wonder, the translation engine. Since reading about it, I have hardly left it alone. It's not that I'm learning one of the languages it can translate English to: French, German, Italian, Spanish or Portuguese. It's just that it's so much fun.<br>The translator is an amazing tool, enabling surfers to key in simple phrases that very quickly come back in another language. Or, if you have a Web page in one of those languages, you can key in the URL and the text on the page is translated into the language of your choice.I haven't started to research the whys and wherefores of what truly must rank as breakthrough technology because, as I said, it's just too funny. The translator is far from perfect, you see, so reading its results is a little like listening to Manuel - the Barcelona waiter with the mangled English - on Fawlty Towers.<br>For example, La Repubblica newspaper is the respected journal in Rome. It is all in Italian but AltaVista's translator can solve that, sort of. The other day it delivered this headline: ?Australia it calls USA Sos on the chat?.<br>Then followed a brief summary of the article: ?An Australian feels while chiacchiera online badly. The friend calls the police who arrives and she saves it: but the friend was in the United States ?? (It was actually a story about an Australian Internet chatter who became sick while online. A friend in the US became suspicious about her quietness and rang Australian emergency services, who were able to save the woman's life).And what could the following headline have meant? ?Of Peter he has decided to March its party.?<br>If you know the URLs of other famous European papers such as Le Monde in France, El Pais in Spain or Die Zeit in Germany, you can be assured of similar dodgy but funny translations.<br>Perhaps it is more useful to aim lower and just type a simple phrase for the translator.<br>Let's say you want to use the phrase ?My, you have the most wonderful bottom? in French. I don't know why you would but let's pretend for a minute that it would make you and the possessor of the French bottom much happier if the phrase was in that romantic tongue. Here is what the translator renders it as: Mon, vous avez le bas le plus merveilleux.<br>Great, hey? Now to check the accuracy you should type in the French phrase you've been presented with and ask the translator for the English version. It is almost word perfect, giving ?marvellous? instead of ?wonderful?, but then the French never shirk at adjectives.If only the translator was so adept on every occasion. I tried the phrase ?Peter Matera is a good half-back flanker? in French, then had it re-translated to English and got: ?Peter Matera is a good flanker half postpones.?<br>You could go entirely stark-staring loony and enter the great John Cleese line from his Hungarian-English Phrasebook sketch: My hovercraft is full of eels.<br>And the results are hilarious. As was Cleese in Monty Python. And being the Web, such a diversion caused me to check around for Monty Python sites. There are several that will keep fans occupied while they think of witty things for the translator to grapple with.<br>You can even find all the words to the Spam song and download a wav file of the last rousing verse. If you're clever enough you could configure it to be the sound that is played when junk e-mail arrives.At the BBC Comedy Zone's Python site are excerpts from the legendary Dead Parrot skit, Nudge-Nudge and the Lumberjack song. Pythonline offers membership of the Spam Club, admitting it allows you to be called Nobby and not much else.<br>And if you're in to that sort of thing, the Spam Club enables you to select phrases from drop-down menus that are then composed into abusive e-mails. There are a lot of laughs out there, but I'm not going to tell you where ? this week.<br>For now it's auf wiedersehn, ciao, hasta la vista and whatever else AltaVista can think of.<br></font></p>
