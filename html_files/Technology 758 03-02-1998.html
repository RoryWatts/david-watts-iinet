            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>SOCIAL<br>Match.Com<br>The mere sight of red love hearts and Valentine's Day cards in store windows is enough to send the hearts of many singles sinking at this time of year. If you've given up on the personal pages and IRC, try this site, which claims to be the ?most popular singles community on the Web.?There is a free trial period after which you must become a full member to keep using the site's services, which include access to chat rooms and the personal love agent, Venus.You know you're in mushland when chats have topics such as ?everything you wanted to know about romance? and ?how you know you're falling in love?.<br>Security is a priority at the site, which uses anonymous e-mail to avoid potential harassment of users. It has members from a number of countries including the US and Australia. (SY)<br>HEALTH/FITNESS<br>Internet Fitness Resources<br>Weight Loss & Fitness<br>Now that Christmas is well and truly over, for some it's time to think seriously about getting those Christmas calories off. Now you can resolve to take them off with the aid of two Web weight-watching sites.<br>The Fitness Resource page is full of nutrition and equipment tips and links. This master site is updated monthly and while it does have commercial links, they are nicely separated from the non-commercial.<br>Since these choices can be overwhelming, the Weight Loss and Fitness site may help you get started. It quizzes you to determine your preferred workout style. The site also offers an interactive, daily meal planner. It tabulates the calories of your planned meals, and then lets you know how much jogging or other exercise will be needed to burn them off. (WP)<br>SCIENCE<br>New Scientist<br>The best popular science magazine has a pretty good Web site to match. New Scientist online contains many of the articles of the print version, in a fairly easy-to-read, frame-based format.<br>Set at a big type size, the articles cover all developments in modern science in language that is straightforward and largely free of confusing jargon. In this week's issue, mice grow human sperm, British supermarkets woo consumers with promises of BSE-tested meat and reports of a planet around Proxima Centauri are investigated.<br>As well as the articles from the standard magazine, there is an NS+ section which carries in-depth features only available online. Among the useful items you will find here are reports on cloning, life on Mars, animal experiments, and the physics of Star Trek.<br>Back issues of New Scientist can also be perused and searched at the site. (HC)<br>MUSIC<br>Tunes<br>They call it the biggest listening station on the Web. And with categories encompassing everything from dance and house, bluegrass and acid jazz to soft rock and pop, hard rock and metal, who can argue?Sadly, Australian browsers can't order any of the 150,000 CDs online here but there's no stopping you from previewing many of the wares if you have RealPlayer installed.<br>The site is also a handy reference point for anyone looking for something new to listen to. When you do a search for an artist, for example, Joy Division, you are directed to any albums that match your search.In this case the only one that matched was an 80s compilation disc. But on the right-hand pane Tunes lists other albums of the era that may also be of interest. In other searches, for example, clicking on the dance and house category, the right pane features a history of disco. Good reading and good listening. And there's even a selection of charts for those who have to have (and listen to) what everyone else is listening to. (SY)<br>METEOROLOGICAL<br>Groundhog Day<br>Meet Punxsatawney Phil and his mates online and discover whether the northern hemisphere winter will end sooner rather than later. If the actions of a small mammal in a snowbound American town seem rather irrelevant to those of us sweating it out in an Australian summer, think again. It is rumoured that the psychic powers of the little groundhog extend to southern hemisphere, only in reverse.<br>For those of you wondering what this is all about, a brief explanation. Groundhog Day is one of the stranger phenomenons which grip the US media. Basically, groundhogs are small, tunnel-loving mammals - bit like hedgehogs without the spikes. Legend has it that if the groundhog of Gobbler's Knob in the US town of Punxsatawney sees his shadow on the morning of February 2, he will return to his den and another six weeks of winter will ensue. If, however, he doesn't see his shadow, there will be an early spring.<br>Go to this site and find out what Phil predicted this year. (HC)<br>TOURIST<br>British Travel Authority<br>The recently revamped BTA site is a must for anyone considering a trip to Britain. Whether you are planning to travel for business or pleasure, you are bound to find some useful tips and information.<br>Check locations and rates for accommodation ranging from bed and breakfasts to manors and hotels. Look for cheap hire cars and learn more about specific regions and their activities. Plan activities such as walking and visiting galleries and find out what regional cheeses you can expect to nibble on. Follow the links to find out more about what's on in London or skim through the introduction to Britain.There are interactive panoramas to explore as well as an interactive map that lets you zoom in on specific locales. So if you're planning to pack your bags for a trip to England, Scotland or Wales, perhaps a few days in the Channel Islands or exploring the lakes and lochs, add this site to your itinerary.
