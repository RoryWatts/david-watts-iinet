            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">If you have created a Web site or have a favourite you would like featured in WebSights, e-mail the URL and a brief description to access@wanews.com.auAll sites reviewed are at our discretion.<br>MEDIA<br>The Paperboy<br>South Perth student Ian Duckworth loves newspapers and his new site is an exciting tribute to that passion. It ranks as about the most attractive newspaper directory on the Web. Stark black and gold and a graphical display of the top mastheads of the day give it impact.<br>It has also been designed with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 users in mind, allowing them to take advantage of the full-screen display. One small quibble in the frames version is the rather small frame giving access to the drop-down menus of papers.<br>That aside, this site is bound to draw plenty of visitors. Mr Duckworth says he has received lots of positive feedback already.<br>Think of a major newspaper and you will find it here, from The Times to The Times of India. (DW)<br>WEATHER<br>El Nino Theme Page<br>If you want to learn more about the El Nino phenomenon there are few better places. The theme page is the work of the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean Project).That may be a mouthful but NOAA as it is called, has all the latest news and data about the disruption of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific.<br>This is causing angst in Australia with bushfires and drought, and is also increasing rain and leading to flooding in the southern US and in Peru, as well as catastrophes elsewhere.<br>NOAA operates a network of buoys which measure temperature, currents and winds in the equatorial band to gauge the effects of El Nino and to try to predict its consequences.<br>The site is loaded with data and satellite images as well as comprehensive FAQs. (DW)<br>ENTERTAINMENT<br>Another Universe<br>Entertainment sites are a dime a dozen on the Web - you can barely click your mouse without stumbling over one. This is pretty much how I discovered Another Universe and its magazine Mania.Another Universe has a mixture of content with the emphasis on sci-fi and comics. You can join the community to participate in chat sessions and read message boards or you can visit a number of ?worlds? including The X Files and Star Wars.In the X-Files world you can read interviews, episode listings and character dossiers.<br>I haven't quite worked out where AU ends and Mania begins since there seems to be a lot of overlap but another on the edge feature is the world of comics comprising Joe Psycho, Too Much Coffee Man and Parkins' Land.There's also a store that claims to be ?the largest collectible entertainment store in the universe? where you can buy caps, clothing, cards and toys. Mania has the usual mix of movie previews and reviews, quizzes and Hollywood gossip, such as the alleged end of the Seinfeld series for NBC, plus sections called Newsarama (what's happening in comic book land), Hollywood Heroes (which comic stars are on TV and in movies) and Scratchbuilder (how to build and remodel your own superhero toys). Not quite out of this world but certainly amusing. (SY)<br>CULTS<br>Trancenet<br>They don't exactly call themselves cult-busters, but Trancenet often end up blowing the whistle on exploitative and dangerous groups who are, let us say, somewhat removed from the normal.This site has comprehensive news, information, and discussion about all manner of cults - their motto is ?psychological freedom in cults, corporations, and family groups?. The items on this Web site often include secret cult documents and testimonies from disgruntled former cult members.<br>Featured cults of the moment are the Taiwan UFO Cult, God's Salvation Church, and Scientology. If you thought that the 39 Heaven's Gate suicides were nothing too excessive this could be the site for you. (HC)<br>HISTORY<br>World's Greatest Speeches<br>Audionet has plenty to say ? or rather it presents people who have plenty to say. This site is a big promotion for a CD-ROM of the World's Greatest Speeches. The CD has more than 400 of them, including Christ's Sermon on the Mount (not the actual one, I hasten to add), Gandhi, Churchill, JFK and more.<br>The Web site has a pretty good sample, if somewhat Americanised. You will need the RealPlayer to listen but it is worth the time and effort.<br>On show are JFK, King Edward VIII's abdication, Richard Nixon's resignation, Edward Kennedy's eulogy for brother Robert and the theatricality of General Douglas MacArthur addressing Congress about the Korean War (the theme: Old Soldiers Never Die). (DW)<br>SPORT<br>Sportswatch<br>This is another example of a Web site promoting something else - in this case Pacific Publications' Sports Monthly magazine - and another example of it working well.The Monthly has got together with OzEmail to produce SportsWatch, which hurls tempting snippets of the magazine at surfers and adds a couple of treats handled better online than on paper.<br>These are a constantly updated sport news wire, with the help of Australian Associated Press, and a feedback debating site. Last week's topic was whether it was wise to have hired Terry Venables at all to be Socceroo manager.<br>And just like the blokey sports mags in the newsagents, SportsWatch feels it necessary to have a cover girl in a bikini to attract the punters. (DW)<br>ART<br>The Greatest Painters on the Web<br>There are only 30 of them and they are the greatest. So say the crew at art site The Fine Site, the presenters of The Greatest Painters Online site. They have put together a nice site which presents short histories of 30 of the most famous painters and includes links to other Web resources related to them.<br>The Fine Site claims the pages are updated very regularly to keep abreast of Web sites dedicated to particular artists.<br>While skewed towards modern painters, with the majority of the artists from the 20th century, the histories and small images are good for people who want a quick reminder of the differences between Matisse and Modrian. Ideal for those about to partake in cocktails with the intelligentsia. (HC)<br></font></p>
