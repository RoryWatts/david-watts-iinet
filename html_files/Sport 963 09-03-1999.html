            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SPORT and exaggeration feed off each other on TV. ?That's an absolutely perfect yorker,? said Jeff Thomson for Fox Sports early on Saturday morning.<br>He was describing a Pedro Collins delivery to Matthew Elliott in the West Indies-Australia Test. The problem was that Elliott dug it out. Thomson, an old sandshoe-crusher, should have known a perfect yorker would have bowled him.<br>Thomson's comment was made to a small audience in WA because it was on pay-TV. The majority of cricket lovers might have expected to hear it - or exaggerations like it - after they had thumbed through weekly guides which advised them that Nine would be televising Test highlights at 9.30am every day.<br>But their hopes were exaggerated.<br>Instead of tight pace bowling by Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, or Michael Slater kissing his helmet after another century to the accompaniment of Thomson, Tony Cozier, Michael Holding and David Hookes, they got an old American cops and robbers show.<br>Nine's Perth program manager, Ric Bryndzej, explained yesterday that Nine had negotiated a deal with Fox for the highlights, but it had fallen apart at the weekend.<br>This means there will be no Test cricket from the Windies in any shape or form on free TV, outside brief shots on the news.<br>One area where Nine has chosen not to fall for hype is the National Rugby League competition. The NRL season kicked off last Friday, but its centrepiece was the double-header at Stadium Australia - the Sydney Olympics venue - on Saturday night in front of a record crowd of 104,583.<br>It was a historic event, but Nine here showed it at 1.35am on Sunday.<br>Mr Bryndzej said the station had given rugby league ?its best shot? over the past few years, but it did not rate. The big night at the Olympic stadium was a ?one-off event? which would not influence the decision to keep the code off air until after midnight during this season.<br>He likened a better deal for the game on WA airwaves to making Sydney or Brisbane stations show Westar Rules matches at top viewing times.<br>And Mr Bryndzej is probably right. Although the stadium crowd broke the world record for rugby league attendance (102,569 in England 45 years ago) only 54,000 attended the five other matches played by Sunday. This suggests the double-header was a novelty and league has limited drawing power in its own catchment area, let alone WA.<br>The National Basketball League has been fighting limited drawing power for several years after a honeymoon period in the early 90s.<br>It must be blessing Seven in Perth then, which showed the Wildcats victory over Brisbane Bullets on Friday night ... just one hour after the ABC showed it as its game of the night.<br>Those with an exaggerated interest in basketball were able to watch the Wildcats come from behind and power to a 105-84 victory on Channel 2.<br>ABC coverage over, they were then able to flick to Seven and watch the second-half fightback all over again.<br></font></p>
