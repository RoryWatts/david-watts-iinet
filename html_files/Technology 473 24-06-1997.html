            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">CLICHES are overused basically because they are true. A very 90s cliche, as overworked as any old favourite, is ?the Internet is shrinking the world?.<br>This is very true. Access to the World Wide Web puts the world, and all its problems, at people's fingertips. Take Hong Kong, for example. The British colony at the southern tip of the People's Republic of China is only one week away from becoming part of China.<br>Britain's 99-year lease is up. The transition from free-wheeling capitalism to a part of centralist, communist China will be one of the biggest news stories in this part of the world at the end of the century.<br>The Web tells us a lot about Hong Kong. The colony of six million people is a real Asian tiger and its technological excellence makes it a big player on the Web.<br>One of the best sites about the handover to China is Lives in Transition, which features the diaries of several ordinary Hong Kong citizens.<br>These diaries chronicle in the simplest terms their day-to-day lives and how they will change under Chinese rule.<br>The diaries are updated regularly and can be read in the context of Hong Kong's history, which is also available at the site.<br>A predictably more formal position is on display at Hong Kong 1997 Web site, which is a creation of the official Chinese Xinhua news agency.<br>This site includes background information, history, handover celebration plans and a picture gallery.<br>Almost diametrically opposed in philosophy is the South China Morning Post, as capitalist in outlook as Xinhua is communist.<br>The Post's site enables surfers to discover the facts of the handover which will make Hong Kong a specially administered outpost where capitalism and communism will be allowed to go hand in hand for the first 50 years of Chinese rule.<br>Of course, there is much happening outside Hong Kong and China. Elections have been held in Indonesia, France, Ireland and Canada in the past few weeks.<br>A broad guide to elections and electoral systems can be found on Richard Kimber's page at the University of Keele in Britain. He has hundreds of links to political resources.<br>HELP DESK<br>Lives in Transition<br>http://www.pbs.org/pov/<br>hongkong/<br>Hong Kong 1997<br>http://www.hk1997.china.<br>com/english/front/front.html<br>South China Morning Post<br>http://www.scmp.com/<br>1997/97main.html<br>Richard Kimber<br>http://www.keele.ac.uk/<br>depts/po/election.htm<br></font></p>
