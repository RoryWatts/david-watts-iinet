            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHEN you're an alleged grown-up it can be fascinating and frustrating to remember how you got there: i.e. by growing up.<br>When I was growing up, TV came in black and white and there was only one flavour of radio which was called the wireless and that was AM. In fact there were so few radio stations that every one in Australia could be printed on the dial of a hulking great wireless with lots of room left over.<br>Australia was split into States on the dial with lots of space for NSW and a tiny space for Tasmania. We knew the States by the station prefixes, 2 for NSW, 3 for Victoria, 4 for Queensland, right up to 6 for WA and 7 for little Tassie.<br>Where I lived in country Queensland (4WK) it was all country and western. Any attempt to tune in to sinful rock "n' roll from Brisbane was met with as much static as music from the Rolling Stones or The Beatles.<br>But I digress too far across memory lane. What I wanted to say was every six months or so we would visit the Sin City of Brisbane for family gatherings. My mum was from a family of eight, so there were lots of aunts, uncles and cousins.<br>My abiding memory is of aunts checking out the offspring (like me) of their sisters and declaring: ?My you've grown.?<br>Stumped for an answer I'd shuffle my feet and mumble. But they were on to some other topic by then, like matador pants or mu-mu shifts (it was a long time ago).<br>Years later, when the only growing I was doing was out and around, I read the perfect answer to ?my you've grown?. It was: ?Grown what?? The fact that such a retort would have guaranteed a clip round the ear meant nothing. It was a perfect case of retrospective wisdom, of ?I wish I'd said that.?<br>Such is the case with the following story passed on by Channel 10 journalist Rex Haw who corresponds with me and a few dozen other like-minded souls on the Internet.<br>HERE is Rex's story: It was the final examination for an introductory English course at the local university. Like many such freshman courses, it was designed to weed out students, there being over 700 students in the class.<br>The examination was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail.<br>Thirty minutes into the exam, a student came rushing in and asked the professor for an exam booklet.<br>?You're not going to have time to finish this,? said the professor sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet.<br>?Yes I will,? replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in.<br>All except the late student, who continued writing . . . and writing. Half an hour later, the very late student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk preparing for his next class. He tried to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there.<br>?No you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late,? snarled the professor.<br>The student looked incredulous and angry. ?Do you know who I am?? he blurted.<br>?No, as a matter of fact I don't,? replied the professor with an air of sarcasm.<br>?Do you know who I am?? repeated the student.<br>?No, and I don't care,? said the smarmy professor.<br>?Good,? replied the student, who quickly lifted the stack of completed exams, stuffed his in the middle, and walked out of the room.<br>In similar vein, Rex passed on this one too:<br>A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day.<br>?In English,? he said, ?a double negative forms a positive. In some languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative.<br>?However, there is no language wherein a double positive can form a negative.?<br>Voice from the back: ?Yeah, right.? Thank you Rex.<br></font></p>
