            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">For a guide to the top and bottom of moviedom, you need go no further than your computer, says David Watts<br>T HE best film in the world isn't much good if no one wants to see it.<br>It is sad but true that there is no accounting for taste and quality does not assure quantity - of people or money.<br>The brutally brilliant works of Greenaway or Wim Wenders attract nowhere near the public devotion and cold cash of a bonehead like Sylvester Stallone.<br>Even an almost mainstream genius such as Woody Allen still exists on a mainly cult following, albeit a big one.<br>But how do you rate film popularity? The box office is one guide but is a terribly kneejerk one and fails to take into account reflection on a film's finer points that may grow with later video or television screening.<br>One way to check a film's popularity in these switched-on times is by surfing the World Wide Web of the Internet.<br>If there is no information on a certain film - no matter how good - chances are it hasn't been made.<br>The biggest and best repository of film data, from hard facts to soft reviews, is at the Internet Movie Data Base, a Web site so good it is mirrored, or copied, in 20 countries, including Australia.<br>The data base, with information on more than 50,000 films, is exploding to meet the demands of the global surfing population, estimated at near 40 million.<br>And it is a democratic haven, allowing common garden-variety surfers to say what they think are the films to see, rather than letting the critics hold sway as they do in traditional media.<br>The data base allows Net users to vote - on a scale of one (for awful) to 10 (for brilliant) - on any film. Results are collated weekly and lists of the most popular 250 films and the worst 100 are compiled.<br>They make fascinating reading. The most popular film, according to the Net world, is not the epic Gone With the Wind or the gritty, romantic Casablanca, but the sci-fi fantasy of Star Wars.<br>It averaged a score of 8.7, meaning Net users rate it as excellent. Pulp Fiction, the comic bloodsplattered film that resuscitated the brilliant John Travolta's career, ranked second with a score of 8.5, edging out the Shawshank Redemption, Casablanca, the Wrong Trousers, Schindler's List and Blade Runner.<br>The Bottom 100 list is more fun to read and dominated by sequels, making you wonder why they are such a Hollywood obsession.<br>The least favourite film among Net users - and no doubt deservedly so - is Police Academy 6, definitely an example of sequels done to death.<br>It scores a miserable 2.2, just ahead of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and, surprise, another sequel in Leonard Part 6.<br>There are few surprises, although the most panned film of 1995, Showgirls, escapes the bottom but the cult classic, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, gets a guernsey.<br>The lists are updated when time permits and as more people use the Net there will be a reshuffle or two.<br>And when new results are posted you can safely assume there will be no accounting for taste.<br></font></p>
