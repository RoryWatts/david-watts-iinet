            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">UNLESS you have been living on Mars you will know that Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is making all the noise in Australian politics.<br>If you doubt the impact One Nation is having, look at the Internet.<br>One Nation has its own home page - now a mandatory facility for political parties. It also is part of a web ring, a facility which allows like-minded sites to link together.<br>The party is the subject of the majority of discussions - though flaming rows might be a better description - in the usenet newsgroup aus.politics, the main political debating area for Australian Net users.<br>But it is outside these now traditional areas of the Net that One Nation is pushing the new medium harder than any of its opponents.<br>In the past month the Perth branch of the party has been deluging a World Wide Web classified advertising site with appeals for support and money.<br>Last Friday the branch had posted 10 of the 41 classifieds at the Australia Announce Archive (AAA) WA Classifieds site. The ads, which have been posted regularly since June, dominate the list and sit among an invitation to a rave party, a scheme to lose weight and real estate ads.<br>The man behind this enthusiastic use of the web is the party's WA liaison officer and Perth branch president, Martin Lebedinsky.<br>He claims he has resorted to cyber advertising because ? The West Australian is not prepared to print the truth, and the general misrepresentation of facts about One Nation by our media?.<br>Mr Lebedinsky describes response to his use of the web as reasonable. Asked to define this, he said he received on average three e-mail inquiries a day.<br>He was not sure whether the responses were to the AAA site ads, or to the Perth branch's home page which he runs.<br>?I have signed 99 per cent of the people who inquired about One Nation,? Mr Lebedinsky said last week. But he refused to give details of branch membership except to say it had risen 500 per cent in the past five months.<br>Mr Lebedinsky's modest use of the Internet may seem innocent, even naive, to experienced Netizens, but it embarrasses the bigger political parties.<br>The WA branch of the Liberal Party, for example, does not appear to have done a thing with its web site since May last year.<br>The home page even touts as a new feature an address by State president David Honey. The only problem is that Dr Honey lost that role to David Johnston last year.<br>State Labor does not appear to have added much to its site since the 1996 WA election and still features an election speech by Opposition Leader Geoff Gallop as the only entry on the speeches site.<br>Bigger movers in State matters are the Young Liberals, who have a vigorous feedback area with arguments, mostly about One Nation, raging for pages.<br>Federally, the Liberal Party's site seems to have ground to a halt, not that it offered much more than information on how to join the party.<br>Federal Labor has at least jazzed up its site with scrolling headlines about policy initiatives, but has had to scrap its excellent Soapbox feedback forum because of the amount of hate mail containing bad language.<br>The National Party, which offers an e-mail feedback area but no public debating area, looks little different to 1996.<br>And the Democrats arguably have the best site, publishing all current policies and e-mail contact addresses for MPs.<br>? The Net virgins, Mike and Diane, who I wrote about last week, have finally revealed all. No they did not make love on the Net. They did admit that their real names are not Mike and Diane, and neither is 18 nor a virgin. Their much-hyped Our First Time site is now run by a condom manufacturer and features a film script of an imagined first sexual encounter.<br>Help Desk<br>One Nation Perth branch:<br>www.collective.com.au/~martin/<br>home.htm<br>AAA WA Classifieds:<br>www.aaa.com.au/world/australia/<br>guest/wa_sa/read.sh political parties:<br>www.iinet.net.au/~watto/index1.<br>html#politics<br>Young Liberals:<br>www.space.net.au/~ylmwa/<br></font></p>
