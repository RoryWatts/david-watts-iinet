            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAS taken 15 rounds for the experts to wake up to an inescapable, scientifically provable fact - when West Coast loses, Fremantle wins.<br>It has happened four times out of four this year, a strike rate of which Adam Gilchrist would be proud.<br>Actually, the message to put a packet on Fremantle was clear well before the Eagles succumbed to Richmond on Friday night - a result that has the homicide squad questioning Wayne Campbell over the murder of West Coast's midfield.<br>Those who follow the stats and the form knew that a Guy McKenna milestone in a night match against the Tigers at the MCG would guarantee an Eagles loss ... such is the science of following football.<br>Was a Fremantle win ever in doubt then? Forget that the team had reverted to being the Shockers the week before and that St Kilda had regained its touch.<br>Now what can the Dockers-Eagles win-loss fact tell us about next Sunday's western derby?<br>Not a thing, unfortunately. Obviously, if the Eagles lose, the Dockers will win. The only way to break the hoodoo is with a draw.<br>Let's look at some other facts and stats, first of all putting aside the inconvenient one that says Fremantle has lost all nine derbies.<br>This is the second time - the first was in 1996 - that derbies have been played in rounds one and 16. In 1996, West Coast won the first by 22 points, its smallest victory until it held on by four points this year. In the return derby of 1996, West Coast won by 34 points.<br>This scientific fact suggests West Coast can improve its first-round margin by two goals and win by 16 points on Sunday.<br>On three occasions, the sides have gone into a derby after West Coast lost and Fremantle won its previous matches. This scientific fact suggests West Coast will win, no matter what.<br>The average score in West Coast matches this year has been 97-74, or a 23-point win by the Eagles. Fremantle's average match score has been 94-105, or an 11-point loss. This corresponds to a 34-point Eagles victory.<br>Both sides have had three common games this year, that is matches against the same opposition on the same ground. Only one - against Adelaide - was at Subiaco on a Sunday afternoon (aping the derby venue and time of clash). Fremantle beat the Crows by 39 points and West Coast nailed them by 54. This gives a 15-point advantage to the Eagles.<br>So there you have it. All the scientific evidence points to a solid Eagles win, even before the likely return of Peter Matera, Ben Cousins and Michael Gardiner are considered.<br>But Fremantle fans can take some comfort from the fact that wonders never cease in the AFL. If the game was as scientific as facts and stats would have us believe, would umpire Peter Carey have marked that ball on Sunday?<br>What we will never know is which way he would have kicked had he played on.<br></font></p>
