            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">A PERTH Internet advertising business is using today's eclipse to boost traffic to its site.<br>Internet service provider Ace Online is experimenting with using current affairs to attract people to its PerthWA Shopping Guide, a site for Perth and WA businesses to advertise their products and services.<br>As well as running a permanent live camera that captures pictures of Perth 24 hours a day, Ace will run a special five-camera ?Webcast? of today's eclipse, at sun.livecam.com.au.<br>Ace manager Nigel Sutherland said projects like these were important to attract people's attention to the shopping guide.<br>?We started doing this sort of project to attract traffic through the site,? he said.<br>?It's easy to get lost on the Internet, and we are trying to get local people to use (our site) - we're not extremely philanthropic, we have to attract advertisers.<br>?We had 18,000 hits per minute during the Skyworks, and the eclipse should be big too.?<br>Two of the video cameras will have strong filters letting them look directly at the sun.<br>The filters are strong enough so that the sun appears as a pale yellow disc, with features such as sunspots clearly visible. Three other cameras will cover the rest of Perth, to show the dimming of the natural light.<br>The show will run from 2pm until 5pm today.<br>The eclipse Web page has plenty of links through to the shopping guide, with the aim of presenting the site as a ?portal? into WA.<br>Ace is undertaking another big project at the moment - building a virtual copy of Perth's shopping centres.<br>Ace has gone down every street of the CBD, taking pictures of the shopfronts and adding basic contact details to the picture on the Internet - free.<br>If shops wish to, they can pay for a more sophisticated link to their own Web site.<br>Mr Sutherland said this was another way of attracting traffic as well as advertisers. He aimed to cover all the major retail and business concentrations in Perth.<br>HELP DESK<br>PerthWA Shopping Guide: sun.livecam.com.au.<br>Fred Espenak's site: sunearth.gsfc.<br>nasa.gov/eclipse/ASE1999/ASE1999.html<br>Australia99 eclipse.span.ch/australia99.htm<br>Geraldton Webcast: www-clients.spirit.<br>net.au/~minnah/99solar/Solar.html<br>General eclipse information: www.<br>exploratorium.edu/eclipse/<br>www.earthview.com<br></font></p>
