            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">FREE speech advocate Electronic Frontiers Australia has fired another shot in its battle to get rid of the Federal Government's Internet censorship regime, due to come into force on January 1.<br>The EFA claimed major uncertainties surrounded the legislation and called for its postponement.<br>?With little over a month to go, it is clear that the regulatory agencies are far from ready to implement the hastily drafted amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act,? spokesman Danny Yee said on Friday.<br>Unresolved issues included:<br>?The Australian Broadcasting Authority had given no details of how the legislation would operate.<br>?The ABA had not approved any adult verification systems, and a draft proposal had been criticised.<br>?No industry codes had been lodged with the ABA.<br>?The Office of Film and Literature Classification had yet to provide information about how film and video classification guidelines would be applied to Net content which was mostly text and static images.<br>Mr Yee said the legislation had been passed with haste and had produced a regulatory nightmare for the ABA and OFLC.<br>The EFA has also criticised the make-up of the 11-member NetAlert, the Government's Internet Advisory Council, which will research new Net access blocking technologies and advise the Government on censorship.<br>EFA chairman Kim Heitman told Australian PC magazine last week that Communications Minister Richard Alston had appointed people who supported his view. There were no representatives of free speech groups or content providers.<br>NetAlert will be chaired by Karyn Hart, the former president of the Australian Secondary Principals' Association.<br></font></p>
