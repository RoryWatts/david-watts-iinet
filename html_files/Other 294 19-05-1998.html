            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Former prime minister Paul Keating caused a tidal wave of controversy when he said Australia was becoming a banana republic. If he was still around, he might warn that we were on the verge of becoming a couch potato republic.<br>The main evidence would be the report by David Utting in The West Australian last week that Prime Minister John Howard and Communications Minister Richard Alston acted against advice from six federal departments when they decided to give the valuable public resource of airwaves away for free to the existing -and rich - commercial television operators for digital TV.<br>Mr Howard and Senator Alston obviously thought they knew best. The conclusion is that they believe it would be good for Australians to sit back and passively ?enjoy? the commercial goodies that the existing TV networks will be able to deliver through digital TV.<br>This includes Internet services. It must not have occurred to Mr Howard and Senator Alston that Australia has one of the highest participation rates of Net use in the world - at least 2.1 million of us are estimated to be online.<br>Digital TV will allow the Net into many more homes, which is a good thing. However, the first experience for a whole new population of Netizens will be home pages and services provided by Channels 7, 9 and 10. Have a look at their sites and compare what they deliver with typical small Internet Service Providers.<br>You might find a lot of cross-promotion and commercialism and very little adventure - a sign of things to come.<br>This may be pessimistic, but can you imagine these operators providing easy access to the often anarchic pages and newsgroups that present ISPs allow.<br>And remember there are more than 700 ISPs in Australia; a healthy and innovative small business community if ever there was one.<br>Striking evidence of the popularity of inter-activity offered by the Net was revealed last week. A report from Melbourne, quoting the Newspaper Advertising Bureau of Australia, said Australians last year spent 130 million hours at home surfing the Net, doubling figures for the previous year.<br>The number of hours spent watching commercial television dropped to about 15.5 billion, down by 470 million, suggesting that many people were switching off and booting up.<br>Newspaper reading, which more than 80 per cent of people did early in the day, did not suffer - with the total hours increasing by 120 million between 1996 and 1997.<br>The conclusion was that TV suffered because most watching - a passive activity if ever there was one - was done at night. This just happens to be the right time for many people to connect to the Net. And on the face of it, those lucky enough to have a choice between passivity and inter-activity went for the latter.<br>The study of these habits was done on a big sample of 60,000 people. It found that at the end of 1996, 15.9 per cent, or 2.3 million people, had used the Net one or more times. This jumped to 28.5 per cent, or 4.2 million people, by the end of 1997. However, regular Net use was confined to 12 per cent of the population. Studies around the world tend to agree with this sort of figure with the bulk of Netizens being 25-35 year-old professionals.<br>Which is where Mr Howard and Senator Alston probably think they are right in opting for a more passive technological future than is possible. A majority of the population still hasn't experienced the richness of the Net, and may well be scared off by the many reports of porn sites and hate mail - carried mainly on commercial TV.<br>The thought must have occurred that it might be simpler, politically, to give those people the devil they know, rather than leaping into the myriad possibilities of thought, opinion, inter-activity and new commerce the present free-wheeling Net promises.<br></font></p>
