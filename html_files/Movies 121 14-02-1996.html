            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">film<br>Powder<br>Mary Steenburgen, Sean Patrick Flanery<br>Lance Henriksen<br>Directed by Victor Salva<br>Reviewed by David Watts<br>POWDER could have been one of the movies of the year. In the end it has too many flaws and far too much silliness. Yet it remains likeable and intelligent, well acted and at times very moving, quite funny and able to surprise.<br>On the surface, Powder is about prejudice and intolerance, about people failing to look beyond appearances for the good that lies there. This is a subject director-writer Victor Salva probably knows a lot about.<br>Salva is a convicted paedophile and parts of the script are no doubt products of an insight only a paedophile could have.<br>At the level of prejudice and bigotry, Powder is entirely predictable. Films such as Mask and Elephant Man have dealt with this theme so much better.<br>But on another level, Powder is intense and powerful. This side of Powder is how it deals with Einstein's concept of the evolving human.<br>To understand this, you had better know the storyline. Powder (talented newcomer Sean Patrick Flanery) is born an albino. His mother is struck by lightning on the way to the delivery room and dies in childbirth. His father doesn't want him so he is raised by his grandparents at a remote farmhouse where Powder spends nearly all his time in the cellar away from the sun reading copiously.<br>He is jolted out of this life by the death of his grandparents and is introduced to the real world by psychologist Jessie Caldwell (Mary Steenburgen giving her usual portrayal of a frail, sensitive yet strong-as-iron character).<br>This is where the prejudice closes in and Powder, like another screen alien, ET, just wants to go home.<br>The intelligence-Einstein theme develops as we learn Powder's phenomenal gifts. His IQ is off the scale, he knows every word on every page of every book he ever read, he can read minds, he touches others so they can feel pain or enlightenment. Best of all he can conduct electricity.<br>This is where some of the film's sillier moments abound. Powder is set in a small Texas town which has an abundant supply of thunderstorms.<br>They're perfect to end long, quiet moments in the film. You can anticipate them. Action a bit dull? Oh good, here's another thunderstorm and we can watch Powder levitate with a trillion volts of white light lifting him off the ground.<br>Powder touches everyone, but mostly Sheriff Barnum (an excellent performance by the cadaverous Lance Henriksen of Aliens, the Right Stuff, Terminator and other sci-fi).<br>The sheriff's wife is dying of cancer and Henriksen is so good you really believe that is the case. Powder acts as ?angel?, reading the comatose wife's thoughts to the grieving sheriff so he knows what has to be done to relieve her pain.<br>This quality of Powder's, to use all his brain and perception, is the hallmark of possible eventual human evolution.<br>The exploration of this possibility gives Powder some intellectual oomph which saves it from predictability and being assigned to the also-ran class.<br>Two little quibbles: how come Hollywood makes even ?alien? beings like Powder as handsome and well-bodied as Robert Redford?<br>And is every small Texas town as bigoted and ornery as this one? If I were a small-town, Texas resident I'd sue those commie-loving faggots up in Hollywood.<br></font></p>
