            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT CAN be easy to mistake the World Wide Web for a philistine's paradise.<br>There appears to be a surfeit of young men with home pages featuring trivia about the X Files, links to computer games and details about Unix ... which is great for their mates, but no help to the rapidly growing population of users who might define themselves as ?perfectly normal? - whatever that is - and not mainstream geeks.<br>The good news is that there is something for everybody out there.<br>Higher minds, or the plain pretentious, can surf into some culturally sound territory.<br>For a start, there is The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. Every word is lovingly presented in simple text format. Users can search texts, copy complete acts and look for apt or simply beautiful quotations.<br>Shakespearean prose such as Romeo's ?what light through yonder window breaks. It is the east and Juliet is the sun? is music to the ears.<br>The ears are treated equally as well at Classics World, a site overflowing with news of classical music and opera.<br>Browsers can download a great variety of audio in MPEG format - Sibelius, Mozart, Beethoven, even Leonard Bernstein.<br>The plots of many famous operas are on display in English, French, Italian and German. Classics World also has a quiz, an idiot's guide and news in brief.<br>Not quite as weighty, but just as worthy and entertaining is the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, which lists the words to all the duo's 14 operas, the music scores, news of G and S societies and allows downloads of excerpts of some of the music in MIDI format.<br>MIDI, synthesised music, is not everyone's cup of tea. It often sounds like a primary school recorder ensemble on speed.<br>But numbers like Three Little Maids from School and the overture to the Pirates of Penzance still sound charming, rather than alarming.<br>Shakespeare was not the only one with a way with words. The Gospels present some of the most beautiful writing in the English language.<br>The Bible Index, kept on the computers of Ohio University, includes a section where a ZIP format of the entire text of the Bible can be downloaded.<br>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare: http://the-tech.mit.edu/ Shakespeare/works.html<br>Classics World: http://www.classicalmus.com<br>Gilbert and Sullivan Archive: http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/GaS.html<br>The Bible Index: http://linus.cs.ohiou.edu/~mwavle/bible/<br></font></p>
