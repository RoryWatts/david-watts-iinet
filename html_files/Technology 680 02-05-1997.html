            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PAULINE HANSON provokes passionate debate in the virtual world as well as the real.<br>The Independent MP is a growing figure on the Internet where several World Wide Web sites have been built to both praise and admonish her.<br>One site on the World Wide Web - the Unofficial Pauline Hanson page - likens her to Adolf Hitler with an animated picture that shows a smiling Ms Hanson melting and reforming as a glum-looking Fuhrer.<br>Her supporters have created Pauline Hanson's Official Home Page and a One Nation page.<br>Among supporters' views yesterday was this offering from Florida: ?In our country the politically correct are paving the way to Hell. People have lost their sense of humour.?<br>One opponent said: ?I look forward to seeing the arch-devil bitch herself whenever you have the courage to come to Perth.<br></font></p>
