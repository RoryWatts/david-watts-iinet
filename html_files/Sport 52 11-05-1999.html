            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IMAGINE, if you will, an overseas sports nut stranded in Perth in front of a television set over the past weekend.<br>Overseas visitor: Can you straighten out some things for me? I am a bit confused.<br>Perth person: Certainly, mate. What would you like to know?<br>OV: I thought AFL football was the biggest game in Perth this time of the year.<br>PP: Sure is. Go Eagles, carna Dockers.<br>OV: Why then does the only daily national sports show, Sports Tonight on Channel 10, make rugby league its lead news item?<br>PP: That would be Sydney bias mate.<br>OV: Well, surely soccer is much bigger than AFL then. Why would two different stations show the same Perth Glory final on one night?<br>PP: Dunno, never happened before.<br>OV: You're kidding. It was a great match and they both covered it well enough; nice shots, good commentary. That Channel 7 looks like it has done a lot of soccer work.<br>PP: Never shown it here before.<br>OV: I suppose the fact that AFL is the big game would account for Seven showing Port Adelaide versus the Bulldogs when it could have been live at the soccer. That Port-Bulldogs game must have been a clash between traditional rivals, top of the table stuff, a must-see.<br>PP: Nah, just another game.<br>OV: Then I guess the delay helped get a few commercials in. Live soccer is a hard game to break up. You never know when they are going to score, or if they are. It's all in the lead-up. Guess they had no alternative but to throw in an ad break a couple of minutes before Bobby Despotovski's winning goal when the atmosphere was at its most electric.<br>PP: Yeah, good goal.<br>OV: I didn't see it. The spell was broken so I turned on the ABC's commercial-free telecast. But it was so late I snoozed off when it was still nil-all.<br>PP: Pity. What did you think of our AFL teams then?<br>OV: I've read about them, but couldn't remember which was which. Now I know what everyone was talking about when they spoke of an exciting team of committed youngsters balanced by experience and prepared to fight hard for the ball.<br>PP: Pity they lost.<br>OV: No, the Dockers were great. But that West Coast lived up to its reputation; second to the ball, falling over, sloppy disposals, bad body language.<br>PP: Whatever you say. Seeing you've picked up the game so well, how do you think the Dockers will go against Collingwood on Saturday?<br>OV: Oh, they'll be beaten. That Collingwood is terrific. I saw the Footy Show on Channel 9 the night I arrived and Collingwood was all they talked about. Awesome.<br>PP: Ah, Melbourne bias and jet lag I'm afraid chum.<br>OV: I'm as confused as ever.<br>PP: Never mind, mate. A week's a long time in sport.<br></font></p>
