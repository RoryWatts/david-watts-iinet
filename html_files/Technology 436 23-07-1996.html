            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">SURFING the Net is fun if you know what you are looking for. But that is not always the case.<br>There seem to be as many search engines as topics and if a Web surfer is not in the right mood, then they can easily revert to the real world - turn off the computer and go outside.<br>The US Internet giant c:net has taken a poke at the frustrating side of searching in its latest newsletter to subscribers by listing a mostly mythical top-10 songs for Net users.<br>Here they are in reverse order:<br>10. I Got Yahoo, Babe (Sonny and Cher)<br>9. I'm So Excite, Inc. (The Pointer Sisters)<br>8. Spies Lycos (Paul McCartney)<br>7. I Can Seek Queries Now (Johnny Nash)<br>6. Boolean Rhapsody (Queen)<br>5. Go (Perl Jam)<br>4. I Can CGI for Miles and Miles (The Who)<br>3. Do Inktomi One More Time (The Captain and Tenille)<br>2. Inagaddaltavista (Iron Butterfly)<br>1. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (U2)<br>- David Watts<br>???<br>POP the corks and down the champers, Australian Web software company, Sausage Software, turns one this Sunday and the party is on them.<br>More than 60 cybercafes across the world, including two in Fremantle, will play host to Australia's biggest cyber-rave.<br>The online party will be held on both the World Wide Web and Internet Relay Chat.<br>Surfers will be able to chat directly to each other on a wide variety of topics including Java, Active X, making money on the Net, and new products.<br>Surfers will also be able to win prizes.<br>Sausage Software has grown from a one-man operation last year, to a company employing more than 50 full-time staff.<br>Hot Dog is Australia's leading supplier of Web-related programs, including the company's flagship product, Hot Dog.<br>Earlier this month, company founder Steve Outtrim announced plans to issue shares in the fast growing company.<br>Projected revenues for the financial year just ended are $3 million.<br>The cyber-rave kicks off this Sunday from 10am at Net Trek and Cafe Aria.<br>- Nathan Cochrane<br></font></p>
