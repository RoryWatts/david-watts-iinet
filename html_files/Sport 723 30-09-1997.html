            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WHO got the most egg on their faces courtesy of Adelaide's grand final win?<br>Sam Newman of Channel 9's Footy Show would have to be the leading candidate. The nicest thing he said about the Crows during the finals was on the eve of their clash with the Bulldogs. ?Adelaide are a very ordinary football side,? said Newman with his customary blunt delivery.<br>He was hardly alone in writing off the Crows. Every tipster at one Melbourne newspaper picked St Kilda, but then, so did all who tipped in this newspaper. Almost the entire mega-panel on The Footy Show's grand final edition - watched live by 10,000 people at Melbourne Park - went for the Saints.<br>The average margin was four goals. Dermott Brereton said nine, but had a second bite of the cherry late in the show and revised it to eight.<br>Over at Channel 7, the talking heads on the Talking Footy grand final edition were of much the same mind ... the Saints just had to show up to win.<br>That was until Eagles coach Mick Malthouse took his place on the couch beside Mike Sheahan and Leigh Matthews to talk to the bubbling Bruce McAvaney.<br>The wise men from Melbourne had just had a look at the odds which showed the Saints at 1/3 and the Crows at 2/1.<br>They all thought those figures pretty reasonable. After all they had been in Melbourne all week where the talk was all St Kilda; Robert Harvey's Brownlow; Nicky Winmar's dad; Molly Meldrum fainting at the 1966 grand final ... and on and on went the stories of the beloved battlers from Moorabbin.<br>A reasonably relaxed, though still thoughtful, Malthouse had a fresh angle on the contest.<br>As the coach of West Coast's grand final teams in 1991, 1992 and 1994, he knew what he was talking about. He said the pressure went off Adelaide the minute the players got on the plane to Melbourne. St Kilda would face the burden of enormous expectation from a State which wanted little to do with interstate teams and had a collective soft spot for the Saints, a club laden with enough wooden spoons to start a good-sized bonfire.<br>Adelaide also had Malcolm Blight who had been there enough times with Geelong to know the score. Even though Blight had been the losing coach each time, the crowd and hype would not be a surprise and he might also have his support staff working more smoothly and faster than the less experienced Stan Alves.<br>On the ground, Malthouse said, Crow ruckmen Shaun Rehn and David Pittman would exploit St Kilda's lack of strength and experience in the all-important ball-winning department.<br>By the time Malthouse finished, Matthews, Sheahan and McAvaney were looking a little glazed and agreed the odds had now shifted much closer.<br>None of this takes away the fact that the Crows' 31-point victory was a surprise. But it showed the importance that an impartial point of view can make on Melbourne-dominated sports shows when a Victoria versus the rest contest is up for grabs.<br>Both Seven and Nine may want to think about balancing their panels a little more next year. If West Coast hadn't already proved it by now, Adelaide certainly has driven another big nail into the suburban VFL mentality of too many Victorian football supporters.<br></font></p>
