            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">twenty-something<br>Vanessa Gould<br>BOOKS<br>Green Eggs and Ham, by Dr Seuss (first read 1975) I remember the words from this book in my mother's high-camp story reading style, with lots of rounded ?o?s and expletive consonants. Sam I Am probably set the tone of my notoriously finicky tastes in food.<br>Nancy Drew Mysteries, by Carolyn Keene (1977). Nothing cooler than a girl detective. Particularly loved the ones about Egyptian curses. Devoured through the mail-order bliss of the Book Club at Mt Tarcoola Primary School.<br>Books by Paul Zindel (1981). Pre-teen books, the plots of which I can't remember, except that I loved them because they were cool and colloquial and spoke in something similar to my own voice (albeit an American one).<br>That Was Then, This is Now, by S.E. Hinton . I was stunned that a 15-year-old could write like this. Showed a true teenagers' hyper-sensitivity to the importance of being in or out of a group. Rumble Fish and The Outsiders also gave me a long lasting desire to find out exactly what Hershey Bars were (the colour of Pony Boy's eyes) a then-unattainable American delight which turned out, rather disappointingly, to be a chocolate.<br>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, by Alexander Solzhenitsyn (1984). Read aged about 15, was amazed at his raw courage and pure principal in the face of totalitarian evil, as the Soviet dissident used thinly-veiled fiction to describd his years of imprisonment in terrifying labour camps.<br>The Outsider/L'Etranger, by Albert Camus (1985). Loved the brutality of the culture clash and sense of crumbling French colonialism in Algiers, all those dark/light, black/white, good/evil images. Studied both in English Literature and French, thrilled at the brazenness of the almost autistically-innocent Mersault, crucified by a society which couldn't bear his honesty. And that fantastic, simple, clear language.<br>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, by Tom Stoppard (1985). Worshipped Stoppard for head-spinningly clever and funny enough to have thought of this wonderful, absurd stuff.<br>Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen. Lizzie was way too pretty and Darcy not nearly nasty enough in the TV series, I reckon. Idolised Ms Austen for her well disguised barbs at her horrid little sexist society.<br>Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut (1987). Appreciated his combination of the very funny and deadly serious through his own brand of gleeful pessimism. My defining images of the horror of warfare are his as he described the bombing of Dresden during WWII.<br>The Children's Bach, by Helen Garner (1988). Her suberb gift with language and sense of the danger and beauty of all things blew me away. Loved her intimate and bittersweet pictures of modern life, love, friendships and characters resplendent in shades of grey. A spinner of magic tales much more interesting than her non-fiction work The First Stone which everyone made such a bally-hoo about. Still, I want to be just like her when I grow up.<br>Mrs Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf (1990). As much as I now want to spurn Virginia out of pure boredom and spite, (caused by over-exposure when I decided, with no consultation with people who should have talked me out of it, to write my English honours dissertation about a ridiculously specialised part of her work.) OK, it was my fault Virginia, I forgive you. I'll be able to read you soon without cringing.<br>thirty-something<br>Helen Crompton<br>Elephant Adventure, by Willard Price (1966). Prep school mental escape tunnel. Two brothers go round the world collecting animals for zoos, tangling with things more poisonous than matron. I fancied the older one (Hal) for a while, then the younger one (Roger) for years. Opening sentence: ?The big bull elephant blocked the path?.<br>My Family and Other Animals, by Gerald Durrell (1972). Exam piece. A bright, overweight lad frolics in Corfu and his home-made coracle, the Bootlebumtrinket. He's fascinated by wildlife and his family's behaviour. Which amounted to the same thing - certainly in my family.<br>The Bell, by Iris Murdoch (1973). The BBC made an excellent TV series of it - was glad they didn't stuff it up. Intelligent look at the human condition and an English at-homeness with sexual hypocrisy plus emotional repression. Poms are happy when foreigners mistake latter for eccentricity.<br>Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger (1975). Plain, silver jacket spoke of modern misfit inside. Displaced, dispassionate yet ultimately confused. And that was just the reader. Describes a man picking his nose with his thumb. Didn't think this possible.<br>Love on the Dole, by Walter Greenwood (1978). Made me long to belong to rank and file - or anyone who'd have me. Somewhere the book suggests we are but reflections of our environment. I argued this was the greatest of literary condescensions.<br>The Mask, by Yukio Mishima (1984). Went to China to escape Stockport and it's viaduct. Got this in a swap. An autobiographical account of Mishima's childhood. An honest account from an exceptional mind. First brush with homo-erotica.<br>Prick Up Your Ears, by John Lahr (1986). Paddington, Sydney: Also a great film (triple pun - needs thought) about the short-lived, audacious, northern playwright. Bought his plays. Found I could do a northern accent at the drop of a lager and lime.<br>The Illywhacker, by Peter Carey (1989). My favourite Australian author. The perfect picaresque novel. Has indecently accurate eye for human detail. Book read in uncanny synchronistic timing with one of those inner journeys you take on the way to Nirvana.<br>Burmese Days, by George Orwell (1990). In Burma so thought appropriate - it wasn't. All a bit mournful - the decaying Empire which managed to betray everyone, coupled with one man's self-loathing because he can't pull the bird of his dreams. Chronic food poisoning in Mandalay.<br>A Singular Man, by J.P. Donleavy (1993). Sat in my older brother's bookcase next to LP Hartley's The Go-Between. Hysterical. Read ending in girlfriend's sister's house in New Zealand. Not even their daft King Charles could shift the cloud cast over me by finishing the book. Mix of cynicism and poetic sentiment.<br>forty-something<br>David Watts<br>Redheap, by Norman Lindsay (first read 1970). Banned for more than 30 years because it had too many allusions to scandals like pre-marital sex, this book gave me a love for Lindsay's words, art and life. It was based in a country town similar to my own, so despite the time difference - Victorian-era Victoria to Bjelke-Petersen Queensland - I saw incredible similarities ... and possibilities.<br>The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway (1970). Heart-warmingly straight and simple, the short novel, which I also saw on film (starring Spencer Tracy) made me appreciate language and love pithiness and understatement as the most dramatic form of English.<br>Catch-22, by Joseph Heller (1970). A teenager's delight. Wacky, funny, irreverent and brooding, it fitted all my moods. I loved it and idolised Heller as a genius. Nothing he wrote after that was anywhere near as good and I read them all. The film of the book wasn't bad, I thought as a 16-year-old, especially when Hungry Joe sliced the swimmer in half with his plane.<br>Portnoy's Complaint, by Phillip Roth (1971). Had everything a 17-year-old boy could desire .. illicit sex, masturbation, teenage angst and rebellion. It really was a triumph to get it on the bookstands in staid Queensland. I never told my parents I bought it.<br>Hamlet, by William Shakespeare (1971). We had to study this for Senior (then the Queensland equivalent of TEE). Though determined not to like it because it was a required text, I fell in love with the language and the story of the misunderstood and love-lorn Prince of Denmark. Misunderstood and love-lorn was how I pictured myself at the time.<br>The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck (1975). Again the stunningly simple language got right to my bones. The tale of misery and courage in the Depression touched chords deep within that I was just realising were there. Led me to read every Steinbeck I could.<br>The Honourable Schoolboy, by John Le Carre (1978). Working in Melbourne, I was far away from family and friends and Le Carre took me into a brilliant fantasy world of spies and global trickery that was addictive. This work made me seek everything he's ever written and brightened up the bleak Melbourne weather so much that after a while I thought it wasn't such a bad place after all.<br>The Icarus Agenda, by Robert Ludlum (1978). Ludlum is pure pap, but at this stage I'd developed an incredible taste for reading (two books a week) and Ludlum was the takeaway food sort of literature that kept me going. Also was flying a lot and found Ludlum extraordinary value on these trips.<br>The Fat Man in History, by Peter Carey (1979). Just when I was starting to worry about reading too much American stuff, along came Carey. His slightly off-the-planet work based in familiar surroundings made me read all his books eventually and to discover other Australian authors like David Malouf.<br>The World According to Garp, by John Irving (1979). A special book. Gave me a love of John Irving and sowed some deep, previously unreleased feelings of fatherhood and family. I also loved the film with Robin Williams and Glen Close.<br>fifty-something<br>Zoltan Kovacs<br>The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas (1955). This was the first book to keep me up until dawn, at the age of about 12. The stirring narrative that took the hero Edmond Dantes from wrongful imprisonment to escape and spectacular vengeance invaded my imagination and made the adventures of Biggles and the Famous Five seem anaemic. I was left in awe of the power of Dumas as a story-teller.<br>Shooting An Elephant, by George Orwell (1957). The title made me think I was getting a book of adventure stories when I picked this up in a library in my early teens. It turned out to be a book of essays - and my accidental introduction to a literary hero. Orwell's meticulous prose and lucid argument unveiled a new world of thought about history, politics and language. His belief that ?the great enemy of clear language is insincerity? could be a motto for all would-be writers.<br>The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway (1960). This was a set text which I read in one sitting the night before an English exam at school. My thought on closing the book was that it was so simple that it could not take much to become a Nobel Prize winner. I've spent the rest of my life learning how wrong I was.<br>The Power and the Glory, by Graham Greene (1962). Greene's genius for crafting a compelling story that draws the reader into a tangle of moral and religious paradoxes captured me young and has never let go.<br>Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1962). Here is a classic that is anything but ponderous. It is an exploration of the psyche with the intensity of a thriller. Its protagonist Raskolnikov is as real to me as any fictional character. It seemed to me on first reading that it was as near to perfection as literature could be.<br>Cannery Row, by John Steinbeck (1965). Steinbeck has written much better books - most notably The Grapes of Wrath - but I always find this a charming literary confection. It is fairy tale for adults that cocks a snoot at materialism and ambition and celebrates simplicity as the key to happiness. For me, it is a joyous antidote to depression.<br>Catch-22 by Joseph Heller (1970). Lunacy takes on its own logic in Heller's satire of war. The insane behaviour of the characters is consistent with the insanity of the war in which they find themselves. The mix of hilarity and horror jars the emotions. Military leaders must hate this book, which became cult reading and changed a generation's view of wars and the people who run them.<br>Power Without Glory, by Frank Hardy (1975). Hardy used the form of a novel to convey his view of events in Australian political history - and ended up in court charged with criminal libel. Power Without Glory was to me an introduction to Australian literature, largely neglected in my formal education, because it caused me to seek out and read other Australian authors.<br>The World According to Garp, by John Irving (1980). I've read lots of better novels but few have beguiled me with such an idiosyncratic view of life's dramas and comedies and caused me to re-examine my views.<br>The Bible (1991). The Old Testament contains many of the best and most enduring stories. And the King James English is a revelation of precise poetic use of language. A few years ago on holiday I set myself the challenge of reading the Old Testament - and was surprised how absorbing much of it is and how much of our culture we owe to it.<br>sixty-something<br>Cyril Ayris<br>Robin Hood, by Henry Gilbert (read in 1945). My first ?novel? and the first book I had difficulty putting down. Robin Hood introduced me to the pleasure of reading.<br>Biggles, by Capt W.E. Johns (started reading 1947). While researching this, I found a Biggles book at home in the back of which was my hand written list headed ?Biggles books I have read? and dated 1949. It listed 19 titles. At boarding school, I read them under the blankets - an offence punishable by a dirty-minded housemaster who thought everybody was as tormented as him.<br>Great Expectations, Charles Dickens (1949). The genius of Dickens's plot construction and the warmth of his characters eased my entry into the classics.<br>The Mayor of Casterbridge, Thomas Hardy (1950). Hardy introduced me to the beauty and the power of contemporary English. He described an English countryside with which I was familiar.<br>Keys of the Kingdom, A.J. Cronin (1951). The seeds of my life-long love of visiting unusual places were planted by Cronin's descriptions of ?heathen? China.<br>King Lear, William Shakespeare (1952). My introduction to the great bard prompted further readings, which set my mind reeling. How could one man, with quill and ink, write so much with such consistent brilliance?<br>The Word and the Sword, Theo Lang (1956). A little-known drama set in biblical times. It introduced me to religion more effectively than the thousand sermons I endured in seven years of enforced church attendance.<br>The Source, Leon Uris (1966). I still rank it as the best book I have read. It instilled in me the ambition (as yet, unfulfilled) to write the towering novel.<br>How Green Was My Valley, Richard Llewellyn (1968). I knew I would not be happy until I had visited Wales and heard the language spoken as Llewellym wrote it. I did go and I was not disappointed.<br>The Day of the Jackal, Frederick Forsyth (1972) was my introduction to the modern ?what if?? novel. It fascinated me and I have been developing similar plots in my mind ever since.<br>seventy-something<br>Athol Thomas<br>Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson (read in 1934). This classic boys' adventure story was presented to me by my mother when I was 10. It was the first book I owned and helped me to understand the differences between heroes and villains.<br>The Alexandria Quartet, by Lawrence Durrell (1968). Nothing else I have read portrays the atmosphere of a city, nostalgia and the shades of love as this continuum (Durrell's word) of a story seen from differing viewpoints. I suspect I have often aped the simple yet descriptive prose.<br>The Ambassador, by Morris West (1966). Like most of West's novels, The Ambassador combines a dramatic storyline with credibility and an insight into what motivates the shakers and doers. And here's a journalist's author: West has a wonderful sense of topicality and timing.<br>The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway (1957). This is a classic example of a true storyteller's art. I learnt from the author's simple, staccato style. Another lesson Hemingway taught me is that a good story does not need to be garnished with intellectual dross, or quotations from the classics.<br>Catch-22, by Joseph Heller (1964). As a World War II man, I can tell you that Heller caught, exactly, the craziness of conflict between the mainly good guys of warring nations. For sheer inventiveness, Heller tops them all. He also seemed to know some of the commanding officers who gave me hell.<br>A Burnt-Out Case, by Graham Greene (1986). The master storyteller was at his best in this novel, which made me sweat as prolifically as his characters in darkest Africa. Green's novels nearly always deal with social, moral and religious themes in the context of highly readable stories. But you may not become fully aware of this until after you put his book down. Then you break into a new sweat.<br>The Matlock Paper, by Robert Ludlum (1974). How does a quiet, respected professor of English with no axe to grind but the one taking care of the kindling suddenly find himself mixed up with the Mafia and worse? Only Ludlum can make the most unlikely plots work. Indeed, his publisher insists on it. This charming American (with whom I once had breakfast) is the master of literary escapism; a bit of which I have found relatively harmless.<br>Prizzi's Family, by Richard Condon (1986). Anything written about the Prizzi family by Richard Condon has entertained me. It has also informed me, since the author has his finger so sensitively on the pulse of American politics, business and general skulduggery that it is a wonder he has not yet been ?zotzed? - by the Mafia, the CIA or plain John Doe.<br>The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, by Thomas Keneally (1989). This story set in the 1890s, has done more than any to make me reflect on the continuing culture-clash between Europeans and Aborigines. Jimmie, ?full of the exhilaration of tribal manhood,? is a tragic figure as he struggles through a thicket of ignorance and hate to his inevitable doom. On another level, Keneally's short, vivid work is an absorbing pursuit story.<br>A Fringe of Leaves, by Patrick White (1992). Not so well-known and certainly less cathartic than most of White's novels, this story celebrates the triumphs of a genteel Englishwoman against the savagery of the Australian wilderness. Apart from its narrative quality and psychological insights, it made me realise that White has done more than any other to bring Australia, Australian themes and Australian talent to the notice of the literary world-at-large.<br></font></p>
