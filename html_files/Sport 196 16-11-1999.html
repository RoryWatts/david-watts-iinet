            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT was a funny, old weekend of sport here in armchair land.<br>Ten hours of the Bathurst 1000 Classic on Sunday certainly kept rev heads occupied.<br>Channel 10 pointed its cameras at any thing that went vroom. And Barry Sheen interviewed anyone who looked remotely like they had on overalls.<br>The pity in Perth - as is so often the case with big eastern States events - was that the telecast was delayed.<br>This meant that when Steven Richards and Greg Murphy were well and truly into the champers, we were still watching the leading Ford of Paul Radisich and Steve Ellery spectacularly shred a front tyre and all hopes of victory.<br>The alternative was for Ten to start the action from Mt Panorama at 4am ... don't think that would have pleased anyone.<br>And it's hard to know exactly what to make of the Australia-Brazil soccer international shown by Seven on Sunday.<br>It was entertaining enough but there never seemed any doubt that even a second or third-string Brazil such as this youthful outfit was a class above our Socceroos.<br>Stripped of the big drawcards, Ronaldo and Harry Kewell, it was a bit hard to take seriously, especially when Ronaldo's mug kept showing up in advertisements and promotions.<br>Evidence of how relaxed Brazil was came in the second half when one of its players almost signed his autograph for a streaker who managed to stay on the field longer than most of his breed these days.<br>Debate was raging in Sydney yesterday about whether the fans had got their money's worth.<br>Bear in mind that the gates were thrown open to let people in for free once Ronaldo was forced out because his Italian club values him too much for friendlies and there's an oxymoron right up with army intelligence.<br>The result of the free ticket offer and refunds for those who had already coughed up was a half-full Stadium Australia lacking in tension, but high on music and colour.<br>Bathurst and the Socceroos must have made some couch potatoes realise how spoiled they had become. Just a week ago we were up to our necks in victorious World Cup Wallabies and a marvellous Test at the Gabba. We were as happy as Adam Gilchrist and as lucky as Michael Slater.<br>But in the weekend just gone the biggest news for us was not something we could see. It was more a case of something to whet the appetite.<br>Seven has drafted Dermott Brereton, the intelligent larrikin of Nine's Footy Show and plans to have him host a Thursday night show in competition with his old mates Eddie McGuire and Sam Newman.<br>Immediate thoughts might be on Thursday and the second cricket Test from Hobart.<br>But it's hard not to want a football hurry-up already, with the prospect of Brereton v Newman on the cards.<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br></font></p>
