            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">WANT a good job? There are a couple floating around in the world of computers and the Internet.<br>First is the challenging role of Net censor.<br>You could earn between $43,378 and $50,242 a year and possibly look at smut every day of the week.<br>The Australian Broadcasting Authority, which from January 1 will have the responsibility of rating sites, started advertising for censors a week ago.<br>Required are proven analytical, investigative and communications skills. But, according to the Newswire site last week, a detailed knowledge of the Net is not considered essential.<br>The ABA does not label the job with the emotive tag ?censor?. Instead the authority is seeking people to work in its online services section.<br>It is all part of the Federal Government's Net content regulation regime that was passed by both Houses of Parliament despite scores of objections and critical reports from representatives of the online industry.<br>These critics - and this column - prefer to call the regime Net censorship.<br>The censors will be asked to follow up written complaints about objectionable sites from the surfing public.<br>Their view of a site will determine whether it is OK for the great unwashed, or earns an X rating - in which case action will be taken to remove the site from access - or an R rating, which means ISPs will have to ensure age-verification software is operating to stop under-18s looking at it.<br>Office of Film and Literature Classification guidelines for movies and videos will help the censors.<br>Bear in mind that most Web pages, even the naughty ones, are made up of text and simple graphics, and thus have little in common with movies or videos. It is just as well that the censors will operate only on public complaints. If their job was to rate the Web, all 800 million pages and growing, then they would be justified in asking for a great deal more than $50,000 a year.<br>Free speech campaigners Electronic Frontiers Australia looked at the enormity and impossibility of such a task in a recent news release.<br>?If you can read and rate an entire Web page in 30 seconds, you would need another 749 people just like you simply to keep up with the new information. Of course, you'd have to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week,? EFA said.<br>If looking at silkpanties.com or leatherwhips.net does not sound challenging then you could always sign up with the Poynter Institute and Stanford University in the US and join their Eye-Track Study.<br>People are having tiny sensitive cameras fitted to their heads to see how they read newspapers on the Web. The good guess is that it is entirely different to the way they read newspapers made of the real thing.<br>And the results, expected in September next year, will be used to help organisations work out the best way to design pages for the Web.<br>The key question is: will results of the eye-track study improve the design of smutty sites? Perhaps only the censors will be able to answer that one.<br></font></p>
