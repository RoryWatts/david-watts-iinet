            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">War breaks out in a fortnight. I don't mean the AFL grand final or the House of Spencer versus the House of Windsor.<br>Microsoft will release Internet Explorer 4.0 officially on September 30 after nearly six months of preview testing. The release will signify resumption of the browser war with still-dominant Netscape.<br>What has been happening on the Web since Netscape test-marketed betas of its fourth-generation Communicator last December could best be described as a skirmish compared with what is to come.<br>Communicator made its official debut in July and seems to have stolen valuable ground.<br>Latest figures from Web surveyors Browserwatch show 65 per cent of hits at its site were made by Netscape browsers. More than 22 per cent - the top figure - came from users with Communicator on a Windows 95 platform. Only 7 per cent of hits were made with Netscape 3.0 on Win95, about the same number as Communicator on Macs.<br>The trend is definitely towards the new fourth-generation browsers. Even though MSIE 4.0 has been on test preview only since April - and Microsoft has warned that only developers and professionals should use it - it is starting to outstrip MSIE 3.0 in use.<br>Overall, Netscape in all its versions still dominates. MSIE was responsible for only 25 per cent of hits at Browserwatch in the above survey after reaching figures in the mid-30s late last year. Those figures were the fallout from the first real browser war just over 12 months ago when Netscape and Microsoft released their third-generation browsers a week apart.<br>Dramatic improvements in the Microsoft product enabled it to chip away at Netscape, which until then had enjoyed around 80 per cent market share. Communicator's jump start in both preview and official releases enabled it to claw back some ground, although security problems have forced several patches.<br>Netscape has seemed a little shaky in the past month too, bowing to user reaction against the thumping 15Mb size of Communicator by releasing a stand-alone Navigator 4.0. This too has had problems because of lack of mail and Java features, which are uncharacteristic oversights for a company that should be feeling perky about being the market leader. What is coming from Microsoft is no secret and must represent a bigger threat than last year's version 3.0 battle.<br>MSIE 4.0 is very good, not just as a browser, but as a complete desktop tool. The Seattle software giant has got its act together, making its operating system almost part of the Web; and the Web part of its operating system. It will be interesting to watch.Will everyday users feel MSIE 4.0 is good enough to justify the big (11-17Mb) download, the installation that intrudes on much of their configuration and the changes in operation (most dramatically, the shift to single-clicking)? Web integration can be turned off, however, and your user interface will return to its former method of operation.<br>Netscape cannot get into the operating system like Microsoft. But at the moment it has the advantage in that it can adapt to many different OSs. But whether that will provide enough ammunition is debatable too.A survey by Web analysts WebTrends shows Win95 and NT dominating the platform market among Netizens. More than 74 per cent use these systems followed by 9 per cent on Win3.1. Just under 6 per cent use Macs. The sky seems full of little white Microsoft clouds.But Netscape has such a loyal following, and users are often stubborn about letting their computers be taken over, the result of the coming war seems as hard to predict as the winner of the grand final.<br>HELP DESK<br>Netscape: www.netscape.com.au<br>MSIE 4.0: www.microsoft.com/ie/<br>Browserwatch survey: browserwatch.internet.com/stats/stats.html<br>WebTrends surveys: www.webtrends.com/<br>PRODUCTS/WEBTREND/REPORTS/industry/<br>browser/default.htm<br>Scholastic Australia: www.scholastic.com.au<br></font></p>
