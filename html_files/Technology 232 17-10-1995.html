            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">MEATWARE is the human side of technology.<br>The US magazine Wired, in its Jargon column in August, defined meatware as the computer component needed to interface with hardware and software.<br>As technocrats are wont to do, the column bemoaned meatware as the component most likely to get things wrong.<br>Certainly the human element is responsible for most of the fun and nearly all the unpredictability of technology.<br>The term ?paperless office? gained a lot of favour in the late 1970s when many businesses were dipping their toes in the technological ocean.<br>Today, of course, you can barely see the mainframes for the printers. Documents have gone feral. Colour and copies are all the rage.<br>Here are a few more examples of meatware on the rampage:<br>The managing director of a big multinational corporation, based in Melbourne, needed to get to a meeting in a hurry - time's money and all that.<br>As he was about to sprint from his office, his computer buzzed to say there was urgent intraoffice e-mail.<br>He started reading what looked a very important document. The first six screens listed addressees from head office executives to reasonably important minions from Karratha to Cairns. The last screen contained the message: ?The company choir will be practising Christmas carols in the canteen on Tuesday. If you're in the area please drop in.?<br>A Perth legal beagle was about to rush to court for an important hearing when his e-mail alert went off. He looked at the screen to see the apocalyptic message: ?The tea club is running short of money. All employees will have to bring their own milk in future.?<br>The legal one reckons that technology has put the real power into the hands of a group of spotty 18-25 year-olds.<br>A Perth man who prides himself on his taste in movies was about to award Six Degrees of Separation 8 out of 10 on the Internet Movie Database when his six-year-old son demanded he give Power Rangers, the Movie 10 out of 10 ... or he wouldn't eat his tea.<br>At a quality London newspaper, the computer system was taking ages to do simple tasks.<br>One of the Oxbridgeeducated reporters sent the Cockney system controller a message, saying: ?I say, it's a bit like Waiting for Godot up here old chap.?<br>The system controller messaged back: ?Who's this bleedin' Godot then? Has he got a logon??<br>(watto@iinet.net.au)<br></font></p>
