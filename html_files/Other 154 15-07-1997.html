            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">No one has died from information overload ? yet. A few eager dogs may have developed dental problems carting in the 400-plus-pages of The West on Saturday. And there are probably a few hernias growing in newsboys forced to deliver weekend editions of major papers.<br>But no actual deaths yet.<br>The World Wide Web, however, has made it possible for a person to be robbed of what up to now has been considered a normal life.<br>Take this daily ritual of a Netizen chosen at random.<br>9am: Log on, read 10 e-mails, respond to five, trash five, fire up Netscape.<br>9.15: Read Australian Financial Review on the Web, then Melbourne Age.<br>9.45: Get stuck into The Guardian in London's special Ashes cricket site.<br>10.15: Check out The Times to see what Tony Blair is up to and what the editorials are thundering.<br>10.45: Killer daemon cuts connection. Have play lunch.<br>11.00: Log back on, deal with more e-mail.<br>11.05: Call up Washington Post and wonder at the statistical obsessions of Americans with high-school basketball.<br>11.20: Find out what Singaporeans are being told in the Straits Times, then see what Malaysians are getting up to in the Kuala Lumpur Star.<br>11.45: Change continents and try to decipher Die Welt in Germany ? fail because German vocabulary consists only of the word ?bier?.<br>11.50: Click through CNN, NBC and American ABC news, then the bulletins of the local ABC.<br>12.30: Killer daemon strikes again. Have big lunch.<br>12.45: It's on again, this time with the Irish Times, Daily Telegraph, Le Monde, Boston Globe, The Hindu ? the list seems endless.<br>Thus, by mid-afternoon this particular Netizen has done nothing more than read the papers. He is well informed but has forgotten to buy the milk, pay the bills, keep a dental appointment, feed the budgies, fertilise the roses and pick the kids up from school.<br>The sheer weight of news available on the Web is staggering already and bound to grow as media organisations realise their futures will benefit by being in cyberspace.<br>For the average person who likes to keep up with events, the choice is wonderful. The fact that much of it is free is a definite plus.<br>Only a very few news organisations charge for their products on the Web, reasoning that exposure to potentially millions of readers can attract advertisers.<br>Others, such as the venerable New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, offer free trials, then ask for paid registration to continue viewing.<br>Still others - the Daily Telegraph in London, for instance - ask surfers to register with a user name and password, but still offer their product free while building important statistics about reader habits and demographic backgrounds, perhaps with the aim of later offering paid specialist services.<br>Certain parts of the Guardian require registration and/or payment. The Economist offers some choice morsels, then asks those interested in a full magazine to register and pay up.<br>In Australia, we are about to feel an onslaught from Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Limited which will offer news and trivia from its diverse sources including Channel 9, Cleo and the Bulletin on the Microsoft Network. Users who want a full service will have to to subscribe.<br>At the moment, though, the majority of news out there is free ? if you are connected, patient and willing to give up a portion of your life.<br></font></p>
