            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">I SAW Hamlet the other day. No, not the bloke. He was dispatched by the envenomed blade of Laertes in Act V Scene II of the Shakespeare play. Nearly everyone else shuffled off then too.<br>The Hamlet I saw was the Kenneth Branagh movie. It was sumptuous, triff, brill, super and bloody good. I could not manage the four-hour version because of B and B, back and bladder.<br>But the two-hour version came to grips with the maddened prince's tale of revenge quite nicely.<br>As it is a half-length adaptation I wonder if it should be called Ham. This has some resonance because one of the main characters is Polonius. In the half-version should he not be called Poloni? Ham and Poloni . . . a very meaty little offering.<br>While we're at it, Hamlet's suffering girlfriend Ophelia could be truncated to Ophel pronounced Oh Feel. This makes sense when the text of the play is examined.<br>Ham and Ophel do a lot of raunchy talking. This is disguised by the old English, but panting teenagers may find their hormones titillated by the dialogue.<br>When I studied the play as a pimply 16-year-old, my schoolmates and I were forever grateful to our matronly English teacher for pointing out the sexual innuendo of lying in laps and maids agroaning.<br>Ham or Hamlet, it matters little. Shakespeare left an indelible mark with this play. Consider the following quotes and you may be amazed at how many still exist in everyday language, either in original form or updated by usage:<br>Frailty, thy name is woman.<br>Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.<br>(The) dog will have his day.<br>For the apparel oft proclaims the man.<br>Neither a borrower nor a lender be.<br>O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain.<br>Brevity is the soul of wit.<br>The lady doth protest too much, methinks.<br>I must be cruel, only to be kind.<br>Sweets to the sweet.<br>All these come straight from the Bard's text and there are many more of course without even mentioning ?To be or not to be? and ?Alas poor Yorick?.<br>PRINCE Charles had a go at modernising ?To be or not to be? some time back. He did it out of despair for modern English. As a primer here are a few lines of the famous soliloquy:<br>?To be, or not to be that is the question<br>Whether "tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<br>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>And by opposing end them.?<br>Prince Charles' version:<br>?Well, frankly, the problem as I see it<br>At this moment in time is whether<br>I should just lie down under all this hassle<br>And let them walk all over me,<br>Or, whether I should just say, OK,<br>I get the message, and do myself in.?<br>Very apt.<br>For some strange reason when I think of Hamlet, I am always reminded of cats, one in particular.<br>One of my favourite GYMs (Gorgeous Young Mums) bought a new washing-machine, a front loader recommended by many as a water saver, power saver and capable of producing the cleanest laundry imaginable.<br>The same day she bought the washing-machine, she bought a kitten for her daughters. I guess if she had a new toy it was only fair they did too.<br>There was much laundry to do. The GYM shovelled armfuls from a big basket straight into the machine's wide open trap, and as laundry shovellers are wont, she paid little attention to what she was shovelling.<br>Well the washing went round and round and round. It was going to be sparkling.<br>Unfortunately the little kitten went round and round and round too. It was snoozing in the laundry basket when its contents were shovelled into the machine.<br>The sad truth was that the cat drowned. It was also flattened and fluffed up, but let's not be gruesome.<br>The moggy's name? Ophelia.<br>(For medium-to-low-brow readers, Ophelia, as well as being Hamlet's girl, went madder than the Prince after he killed her father Polonius. She escaped custody, garlanded herself with flowers and drowned).<br></font></p>
