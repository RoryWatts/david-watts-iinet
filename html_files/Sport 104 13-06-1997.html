            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT HAS been a truly miserable week. I am not talking about the weather. Come June you have to expect gales, deluges and cold nights, otherwise it would not be winter. In fact the weather is quite bracing; it makes one feel alive.<br>Why we would want to feel alive is another matter this sad, old week.<br>It started when St Kilda beat the sick and sorry - but brave - West Coast Eagles on Sunday. The Saints scored 13 goals. Then North Melbourne beat the game Freo Dockers on Monday by 26 points - that's twice 13 for the inummerate.<br>In between, England's lads put something in their tea and thrashed Australia in the first cricket Test (I am not making this up for those who might have been away on another planet). To stretch a point, Australia was beaten by the resources of an England squad of 12 and its coach David Lloyd.<br>Why that makes 13 doesn't it?<br>And to continue the sporting misery line - and yes it was last week - our Pat Rafter was beaten in the semi-final of the French Open tennis in four sets. He lost the last in a tie-break by 7-6 . . . and that comes to 13.<br>Bad luck all round, but not as bad as you're having, seeing you're reading this on Friday the 13th.<br>This miserable week now culminates in that traditionally superstitious day. Why, you may ask, is Friday the 13th unlucky?<br>I have it from various sources in books on fables, myths and folklore that Friday is unlucky because that was the day Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, Noah's flood started and Christ was crucified.<br>Thirteen is a cursed number because early Christians noted that 12 witches plus one devil were present at Satanic ceremonies. There were also 13 at the Last Supper - 12 disciples plus Jesus - an event not laden with luck. The combination of Friday and 13 is a deadly one where all energies should be used in not walking under ladders, not letting black cats cross your path, and ensuring the salt does not spill.<br>I HAVE another. Don't listen to the TV or radio. What passes for music, particularly in the commercials, will invade your frontal lobes (seats of pleasure) and make your life a misery.<br>For example, I cannot get the song Young at Heart out of my head. It's played as the background to some wholesome ads for Arnotts on the TV. While nerdy teenagers edge closer together on the couch, some American intones the words ?And if you survive to be 105 etc etc?.<br>Of course he doesn't sing ?etc etc?, but the melody is one of those dull, thudding things that won't go away. The song is mingling in my brain with that wonderful aria so dreadfully ruined in the MacDonald's ad; the one where a squirt of sauce superimposes itself over some gorgeous operatic trills.<br>Now I can't listen to any opera at all without fearing a rude, squelching sound.<br>Those two numbers have joined a lot of other modern-life-imposed rubbish like ?Perth's Home With 7?, the rockabilly theme to the footy and the National Bank's homely little offering.<br>It is a curse to have such music going around one's head. Once, the band in a man's head was formed by warbling magpies, buzzing insects and even aarking crows. He was at one with nature, in harmony with his planet.<br>Now as he strides down St George's Terrace he is driven by the sounds of the theme to The Nanny or the nonsense of the Neighbours song.<br>Better to hear the buzzing of bees . . . except that it brings back wretched memories of Honey by Bobby Goldsboro, possibly the sickliest example of American goo ever.<br>There appears to be no answer. I'll just have to find the words to ?Friday on My Mind?.<br>©David Watts can be contacted via e-mail: watto@iinet.net.aus<br></font></p>
