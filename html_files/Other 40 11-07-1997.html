            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">IT IS tempting to resign from parenthood during the school holidays. But executive management - aka the wife - will not allow it. It is not an option. About time you got your fair share of the children, chance to bond, clean up, settle arguments, savour kiddie talk and cook without reward.<br>Children, it becomes clear after the briefest acquaintance, come from another planet. We know we planted the seed and they're the fruit of our loins and we posed them naked on bunny rugs at three months so the yellowing picture could be pulled out to embarrass them in their teens. But some time between the ages of four and eight they are abducted by aliens and replacements are sent to Earth to bedevil doting parents until they are 19 or so.<br>I believe they come from Mars and maybe the Pathfinder and Sojourner one day will flash back pictures of humanoid life forms in baseball caps, Converse shoes and sullen attitudes standing in a landscape that looks suspiciously like the Pilbara.<br>The first lesson if you're attending to their every need is to know their creed. It is: Never put things back. So if a child pours a litre of milk on a bowl of Mini-Wheats, not only will the excess milk slurp all over the kitchen floor, but the milk carton will remain on the kitchen bench. Fridge? That's what you take things out of after holding the door open for 20 minutes.<br>No matter how neat and tidy the house you wake up in is, during school holidays it will be trashed within 10 minutes. Experiments at drying flowers or making perfume require all available kitchen utensils and condiments. And none of them ever go back.<br>Recently in our house, dozens of rose petals were left to dry on the front lawn. Very pretty . . . but they were on that morning's copy of the still unread West. ("Don't panic Dad, it's only the front pages.?)<br>All notions of sense and logic are being swept further away by a new toy craze this winter. It's called the Tamagotchi virtual pet. I warn parents to resist this blatant alien invasion at all costs.<br>THE Japanese invented the Tama-gotchi and loosed it on an unsuspecting world late last year. The marketing trendies claim in their spiel that the virtual pet ?hatched from tiny eggs after traveling millions of light years through cyberspace?. And children, being aliens themselves, have fallen for it. Why it's just like the pogo stick, the hula hoop, the yo-yo and monster bubbles. They've got to have it.<br>The Tamagotchi is actually a small plastic device on a chain, a little bigger than a good-sized broach. It is a beeping, noisy little toy that pretends it is a real pet. Digital readouts on a small screen tell its age (one day equals one Tamagotchi year), its weight and whether it's happy, sad or hungry.<br>Confusing combinations of button pressing allow the alien owner to discipline or feed the Tamagotchi. It can also be cleaned up after doing a virtual poo midway through the Beautician and the Beast - something it signals with a rather rude bleep.It's all meant to promote responsibility and care for another life form.<br>When my lovely little aliens put the hard word on for a Tamagotchi I rightly asked had they been responsible and caring enough to take their real life dog for a walk, or feed the six budgies out the back, or push a bit of biscuit at the hermit crab which I suspect actually went to meet its maker some months ago.<br>Oh no, mum can walk the dog and you can feed the budgies and we buried the hermit crab, we wanna Tamagotchi. I gave in after 24 hours of alien sulkiness.<br>Now I must go . . . the Tamagotchi needs to be cleaned and the kids are too busy looking after their pet rock.<br></font></p>
