            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE rugby union World Cup has gone pretty much as expected ... except that France and Australia will meet in the final next Saturday.<br>And in this State, where the majority doubts rugby is the game they play in heaven, the semi-finals at the weekend rated their socks off for Channel 7.<br>Program director Jamie Martinovich said yesterday that Saturday night's thriller, in which Australia beat South Africa in extra time, attracted 91,200 viewers or 52.5 per cent of the late night audience.<br>Seven showed the semi on an hour's delay. The advertised starting time was 10.10pm, but the family film Spy Hard did not cease its puns and sight gags until after 10.30 and the game did not kick off on screen until after 11.<br>All this enraged some rugby supporters who used an Internet forum normally devoted to computer talk to discuss dark deeds such as boycotting the station.<br>Mr Martinovich assured this column that the final and all the festivities of the cup closing ceremony would be live from 9.30 next Saturday night. These developments will no doubt be a pleasant surprise for rugby fans.<br>But after the weekend's drama, it is hard to think that anyone could be surprised by anything associated with this World Cup.<br>For a start, no one really expected Australia and South Africa to ignite a lacklustre tournament in almost exactly the same way the two nations did at the cricket World Cup earlier this year.<br>And no one expected the match would be forced into extra time. After all, the ground announcer told everyone there were only two minutes left and the Wallabies looked home easily.<br>But the referee had different ideas about time and the extra seven minutes he added gave Jannie de Beer ample opportunity to kick the Springboks back into it.<br>No one expected Australian flyhalf Steve Larkham to unleash a 47m drop goal to win the game. The unpredictable Wallaby had been pretty wretched with his boot up to then and one of his mongrel punts had allowed South Africa to bring the ball within kickable distance during injury time.<br>No one gave France a chance. A British Internet poll on Saturday showed only 1 per cent believed France could win the cup. Australia was better off with 9 per cent, but both NZ and South Africa attracted more than 25 per cent, and the biggest vote went to ?don't care?.<br>When Jonah Lomu turned into a human truck, as Seven's Chris Handy described it, the French resistance was about as effective as custard.<br>No one would have believed the same team capable of rattling the All Blacks so thoroughly as to constantly disrupt their line-outs, win back the kick-offs and force backs such as Tana Umaga and Andrew Mehrtens into schoolboy errors.<br></font></p>
