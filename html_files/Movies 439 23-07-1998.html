            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">BLACK DOG<br>Music stars Randy Travis and Marvin Lee Aday, aka Meat Loaf, join former dirty dancer Patrick Swayze in this on-the-road action thriller about a trucker forced to transport millions of dollars in stolen weapons in order to save his family. From the producer of Backdraft, Dragonheart and Daylight with Kevin Hooks of Passenger 58 fame at the helm. Rated M<br>SHE'S SO LOVELY<br>Nick Cassavetes resurrects a script penned by his late father John, the godfather of independent cinema, to make his directing debut. It stars Sean Penn and real-life partner Robin Wright as a heavy drinking couple whose passionate, stormy marriage ends when Penn's Eddie completely loses control and is sent to a mental hospital for 10 years. When he comes out he finds his wife happily married to rich guy Joey (John Travolta). At the Luna. Rated MA<br>TOTAL ECLIPSE<br>Made well before Leonardo DiCaprio rocketed to superstardom with Titanic, Total Eclipse is about the torrid love affair between the French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud and his older lover, fellow poet Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis of Naked fame). The script is by Christopher Hampton, who adapted his own stage play, and direction by Agnieska Holland, the Pole whose best-known films are Europa, Europa, Olivier and The Secret Garden. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated MA<br>THE X-FILES<br>FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) undertake their scariest journey - off the small screen, where their show enjoys a cult following, and on to the big screen. The movie takes up from the season's final episode, with their ghostbusting activities shut down and the pair re-assigned to the anti-terrorism unit in Dallas. But when a young boy stumbles into a cave containing a 35,000-year-old skull, Mulder and Scully are back chasing spooks. Written by series creator Chris Carter and directed by Rob Bowman, one of the show's regulars. Rated M<br>THE APOSTLE<br>In a Hollywood whose idea of a character flaw is uncapped teeth and cellulite-ingrained thighs we must fall to our knees and give thanks and praise for Robert Duvall's Sonny Dewey, a Texas Pentecostal preacher with ?a wandering eye and wickie-wickie ways?. Sonny's struggle to redeem himself, which involves building a church in an impoverished Louisiana town, makes for arguably the year's finest film, a deeply compassionate, powerfully acted drama - Duvall arguably gives his best performance to date - about a simple, God-fearing folk who are normally ridiculed by the movie industry. At Cinema Paradiso. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>CRACKERS<br>It was bound to happen - another rough-as-guts Ocker comedy that aspires to be the lovably ugly twin to The Castle. Unfortunately, Crackers writer-director David Swann is way too ambitious for his own good, yanking this story about several generations of the dreadful Dredge family coming together for Christmas from one end of the taste and sensibility spectrum to the other. Occasionally, there is a gleeful dagginess to some of the gags, usually perpetrated by the Bart Simpson-like Joey. But Swann doesn't know how to mesh the crude, rude funny bits with the skew-wiff attempt to say something meaningful. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>DR DOLITTLE<br>Forget the anal humour and the shameless exploitation of cute children and what you have is a funny and enjoyable very 90s updating of the classic tale about a doctor with a talent for talking to animals. Eddie Murphy gives a surprisingly straight performance in the title role, allowing the humour to bounce off him rather than hamming it up as he sometimes does. And the animals are terrific - not cute and fuzzy but bristling with attitude, funny lines and cynicism, especially the tiger with a chronic headache. Rated PG (David Watts)<br>GREASE<br>It's a little hard to take seriously a musical in which the ?teen? stars were all pushing 30 (Stockard Channing was in fact 34). But the inappropriate casting is part of the campy appeal of Grease, with director Randall Kleiser injecting huge energy and devil-may-care high spirits in bringing the hit stage show to the screen. Sure, it's a TV perennial but colour and movement, great songs and spicy humour (especially from movie-stealing Channing as the tarty Rizzo) can only really be appreciated on wide-screen with its digitally remastered soundtrack. Rated PG (Mark Naglazas)<br>SPECIES II<br>It hardly seems possible but the sequel to Species is even more stupid than the first - ridiculous in the extreme, painful to watch and downright laughable. This time part-human, part-alien Natasha Henstridge's must decide whether she will help track down an infection which causes monsters to grotesquesly burst out of bodies. Half a star for the beautiful babe and half a star for the laughs. Rated MA (Carolyn Martin)<br>TWENTY FOUR SEVEN<br>There's a touch of Scorsese in the visuals and jittery performances in this impressive debut by self-taught 26-year-old director Shane Meadows about a jaunty, never-say-die battler (Bob Hoskins back on home turf and giving his best performance in some time) who sets out to save an English town's youngster from a boozy-druggy oblivion by reviving the boxing club of his youth. But the rather superficial script doesn't give us enough insight into the Hoskins character for the ultimate tragedy to be deeply felt. At Cinema Paradiso and Greater Union Innaloo. Rated M (Mark Naglazas)<br>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS<br>Terry Gilliam is amazingly faithful to the surrealistic Hunter S. Thompson's classic of gonzo journalism, recreating the Dante-esque drug-fuelled nightmares that sidetracks sportswriter Raoul Duke (a dead-on impersonation by Johnny Depp) and his heavyweight Samoan attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta (Benicio Del Torro) from their task of covering a motorcycle race in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the film becomes tedious and pointless when Gilliam dwells on the terrible, intravenously joined twins thrashing about in their hotel rooms eating, snorting and drinking every available high-inducing substance, sinking deeper into their own real and imagined squalor (those with weak stomachs be warned). At the Luna. Rated R (Mark Naglazas)<br>DEEP IMPACT<br>The killer wave unleashed by a comet the size of Mt Everest hurtling toward Earth is certainly scary, almost worth the price of admission alone. But what gives you an even queasier feeling than a wall of water moving at the speed of sound is the tsunami of tears unleashed by this Spielberg-produced disaster movie-cum- weepie, in which all the thrills we usually expect of this kind of B-grade fare are swamped by sentiment and slush. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br>SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS<br>Harrison Ford and Anne Heche bring considerable charm to this old-fashioned romance about a no-nonsense New York magazine journalist stranded on a South Seas desert island with a crusty, hard-drinking pilot. Unfortunately, director Ivan Reitman has succumbed to the panic surrounding the age/sexuality of Ford and Heche. Rather than teasing out the differences between the two leads, which is mandatory for this kind of old-style, wise-cracking, sparring-lovers romantic comedy, Reitman seems too intent on reassuring us that old guy Ford and young lesbian Heche could indeed be a couple, depriving the film of genuine spark. Rated M (Mark Naglazas).<br></font></p>
