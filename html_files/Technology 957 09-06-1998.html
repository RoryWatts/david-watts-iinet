            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The Web is a treasure trove of useful software, but unless you have the know-how, getting it on to your hard drive can be tricky. DAVID WATTS provides a basic guide to downloading for IBM-PC compatible computers.<br>Experienced surfers might agree there are more exciting pastimes than downloading software from the Web. Having a cup of tea or watching paint dry come to mind.<br>Yet downloading can be a mysterious and nerve-wracking adventure for newcomers. This guide is designed to relieve the tension and emphasise that the exercise can be worthwhile - even if it is boring. What is downloading?<br>Every time you view a Web page, receive e-mail, call a newsgroup item or use FTP can be considered downloading. You are drawing contents from another computer connected to the Internet down to your computer.<br>We will confine ourselves to Web downloads, those performed with a browser such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>Browsers are configured to handle the big variety of file types available on the Web in different ways. Mostly, you look at HTML (Hyper Text Makeup Language) documents that are the bread and butter of the Web.<br>HTML authors can embed other file types - jpeg images, wav audio, RealPlayer audio or video - on their pages and different programs will play those when clicked.<br>Internet Explorer 4.0 handles files on the Web according to general system settings in Windows 95. You can check this by going to System Explorer and clicking on View, then Folder Options then File Types. In Netscape, go to Edit, Preferences, Navigation then Applications to see details of how the browser handles different files.<br>What we are concerned with is downloading software, that is, programs that mostly carry the .exe (for executable) or .zip (for zipped) extensions.<br>Browsers should be configured so that when you click on a program, a dialogue box opens asking what you want to do with the file. Typically, you will want to save it to your computer.<br>Why download software?<br>The start-up packages most new Web users receive from Internet service providers are fairly basic, usually consisting of a browser, e-mail package, chat program and perhaps FTP.<br>That is more than enough to get you going, but you may want more to enhance either your personal computing or Net experiences. The Web is an enormous repository of software. It might well be called Programs R Us.<br>On it you can find cheap and free software that can update your browser, scan for viruses, allow you to create Web pages, edit images, play games or boost your audio and video capabilities, for example.<br>Both main browser types rely on Web-supplied software for important plug-ins such as RealPlayer and Shockwave that can brighten up the browsing experience. (See separate story for recommended downloads).<br>How to do it<br>1. Set up a folder on your system, specifically for downloads. Call it something memorable like downloads or progs.<br>To do this, in Windows 95 open My Computer, then your hard drive (typically C:), and from the File menu choose New, Folder. When the folder appears, change its name to Downloads. Better still, you can create the folder on your desktop where it is readily accessible.<br>Right click on a clear space on the desktop, click New, then Folder, type in the name and hit Enter.<br>2. This step assumes you either know what software you want to download (see separate story for suggestions) or you know the sites that will have the latest and the best (see separate section).<br>When you have a Web page in front of you telling you to download, just click on the link offered. Internet Explorer will present you with a dialogue box asking if you want to open the file or save it to disk. Choose save it, then navigate to the folder you have set up for downloads and hit Save.<br>Netscape will probably open a box which gives details of a folder destination for saving. Make sure it is the one you want. If it isn't, navigate to it, then OK the download. Occasionally Netscape will present a multiple-choice box. Ensure you choose the option to save to disk, then navigate to your download folder.<br>3. Both browsers will show details of the progress of the download and, if the file allows, give the estimated time until completion.<br>This time varies on the size of the file you are downloading and the speed of your modem, both of which can be affected by network conditions such as congestion or line quality.<br>You can sit and stare at the box as it shows the multi-megabyte download crawling down to your system, but it is definitely as exciting as watching grass grow.<br>You can open another browser window and continue surfing, but it will be noticeably slower because, as was said at the beginning, all Web page viewing is downloading and you already have one under way.<br>Equally you can download another program at the same time, with the same qualifications on speed.<br>4. When the download finishes, Internet Explorer will notify you with a small box which you have to OK. In Netscape, the download progress box will simply disappear.<br>You should really disconnect from the Net, so most of your computing power can focus on installing your new software.<br>Go to your download folder and double-click (single if you have Win 98 or have Web-enhanced Win 95) on the program you downloaded.<br>If it is an .exe file, it should start up a dialogue that enables painless installation by following prompts.<br>If you have downloaded a .zip file, you should have a program such as WinZip to extract the files that have been packed into it. A zip extraction is like unbundling a super-tight suitcase. You open one file and inside there are several.<br>Often one of the files inside will be an executable file named setup or install. This will prompt WinZip to offer a toolbar button marked Install.<br>From there it is easy. But if there is no setup file, then you will have to use the Extract function to move the unzipped files to a new location.<br>5. Run a virus scanning program immediately on installation of new software, then clear out any rubble - that is, either delete or move to backup discs the original installation software you downloaded. This keeps your system tidy.<br>Where to find software<br>Software is probably the biggest commodity for sale in cyberspace, so there is no end to the sites at which it can be found.<br>One of the most reliable, with a Perth mirror, is Tucows. It sounds like Two Cows but means The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software.<br>Equally comprehensive and easy to navigate is Download.com, one of the myriad services provided by computing giant cnet.<br>Other good sources include Beyond the Black Stump, Filez, ZDNet, Winfiles.com (this used to be known as Windows95.com), Consumate Winsock, WUGNET (the Windows User Group Network) and the Free Software Store.<br>You should also check your ISP to see whether they have sites they either maintain or recommend for program downloads.<br>nA handy online tutorial is available at ZDNet. It allows the user to download a piece of software by following easy links.<br></font></p>
