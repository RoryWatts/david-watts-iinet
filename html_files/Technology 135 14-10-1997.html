            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Luckily the painters were working round the house the day I decided to download and install Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.<br>I was able to watch their paint dry rather than put up with the excruciating boredom of waiting for 16Mb of the Net-busting software to trickle its way to my hard drive.<br>The wait was actually worth it but bear with me while I have a little whinge.<br>When I say ?the day? I downloaded MSIE 4.0, I really mean the night before and the bulk of the next day. MS's latest is so popular, it seems, that every nerd and geek and a reasonable proportion of normal Win95 and NT users among the world's 50 million Netizens were trying to download it at the same time.<br>Nothing else can explain the logjams in cyberspace that forced me to make five attempts at the software ? and all from Australian mirror sites.<br>Let's start at the beginning: 10pm on a Thursday night, hardly peak hour on the Web in Perth.<br>I logged on and went straight to MS's IE4 page. Several clicks later, I was at the download site. Here was the first surprise - to download MSIE 4.0 you need to download a set-up file. That is, you need to download to download. Clear enough?<br>Anyway, it went swimmingly. The 440Kb file took about two and a half minutes to shoot from the OzEmail site.<br>Then the fun began. The instruction was clear enough; double-click the set-up file and await further orders.<br>The wait was several minutes, after which I was asked what country I wanted to use MSIE 4.0 in because this determines which channels come with the browser.<br>A little pause for memory's sake and I was able to click on Australia. The next window the set-up wizard presented me with had North America in the multiple-choice window. By daring to buck the menu, I was able to find Australia/Asia and be presented with a choice of download sites.<br>I happily clicked on OzEmail again, presuming a local 16Mb download would be over in about two hours.<br>I went out to watch the grass grow but seeing as it was dark not much was on offer. Back at the screen, it was much the same story.<br>After five minutes, the animated window that gives the impression kilobyte after kilobyte is flowing to your computer, was busily giving the impression that kilobyte after kilobyte was flowing.<br>In fact, the message on the misleading animation informed me 35Kb of 15,000-odd Kb had found its way from OzEmail.<br>I went out to plant some grass, water it and watch it grow ? and damn the consequences if it was pitch black out there.<br>Two hours later, I returned rubbing my grass-stained hands in anticipation of an install.<br>?Connection timed out,? said one message. ?Download failed to complete ? nyaah, naah, na, na, na,? said another, I think.<br>I went to bed dreaming of Netscape.<br>The next day, I made attempts at 10am (unable to get to OzEmail or Telstra BigPond), 10.15am (abandoned at 11am when busy animated window announced only nine hours 10 minutes to go) and high noon (spat the dummy at 12.30pm when another nine-hour announcement brightened my day).<br>I took the kids to see George of the Jungle, which was much more fun, and wondered how much the computer might fetch on the open market and what an alternative lifestyle would be like.<br>At 5.30pm, I girded the loins again and plunged in. For some unfathomable reason, all went brilliantly and after two hours inspecting the drying ability of Wattyl Williamsburg Blue I was shocked to see instructions on how to complete the installation.<br>By this time, I had nearly forgotten what installation. But that piece of forgetfulness was soon wiped by the laborious spinning of the MS globe while MSIE 4.0 gleefully ate 35Mb of my hard drive.<br>As I said earlier, it has actually been worth the trouble so far. I am impressed with Explorer's Web view of the operating system and the many enhancements to the browser which include providing a true full-screen view of Web pages (not even a Start button to obstruct the view).<br>However, the next time MS offers a thunderously big download - and they are becoming sillier all the time - I'll gladly wait and pay for the CD.<br></font></p>
