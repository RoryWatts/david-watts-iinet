            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">PHANTOM is good, clean fun. It could just make an Old Jungle Saying and be applied to the film that has been popular in Perth for the past few months.<br>The film is not bad at bringing the comic-book hero to technicolor life, but for the real low-down on the Ghost Who Walks you need to visit a couple of sites on the Web.<br>The Phantom site, officially tied up with the Paramount film, presents a tour chock full of trivia. Surfers can enter the Skull Cave and explore each main treasure therein.<br>For example, a simple click on the Phantom's throne will bring up a story about the throne's origins and those of the Chain of Patience draped on it.<br>More tall tales emanate from the Treasure Room where the Phantom not only has King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, but also a cup made out of one gigantic diamond.<br>The best place to visit is the Chronicles, where by clicking on one of 21 volumes you can read the biography of most of the Phantoms.<br>Each story is as unbelievable as the next, particularly the one where the 19th Phantom becalmed a bull elephant, moved a boulder the size of a house, then successfully wrestled a 3m giant - all in three days - but they are fun.<br>Another Phantom site - The Ghost Who Walks - maintained in Australia is a different sort of treasure trove listing every Phantom comic-book storyline in the past 60 years, relating fascinating trivia about the Phantom suit's real colour (it should have been grey), and summarising the life of Phantom creator Lee Falk.<br>The big disappointment at both sites seems to be a lack of the full list of Old Jungle Sayings; indispensable in any serious look at the superhero.<br>URLS: www.thephantom.com<br>Official Phantom site<br>www.ozemail.com.au/%7Eguran/<br>Australian site<br></font></p>
