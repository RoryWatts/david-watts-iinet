            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">That song which instantly transports you back to your first love ... the film star you saw as a teenager, larger than life, on the big screen, whose style and attitude you thereafter tried desperately to emulate ... the book through which you briefly entered someone else's unforgettable world ...<br>Perhaps you still adore that song, that movie, that novel. Or perhaps you cringe at the memory.<br>Films, songs and novels can define and even influence pivotal times in our lives, forming popular cultural landmarks from childhood through to adult years.<br>In this edition of The West Magazine, six journalists from across six decades - the youngest, 20-something; at the other end of the spectrum, 70-something - tell us of the films, songs, and books which had significance in their lives.<br>twenty-something<br>Vanessa Gould<br>FILMS<br>The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976). My first memory of the wonders of cinema is watching David Bowie reveal his yellow alien eyes in the bathroom mirror as he removed his blue-coloured contact lenses. It was a mystical moment, especially as I was not meant to see it, allegedly curled up asleep in the back seat at the drive-in.<br>Grease One (1978) and Grease Two (1982). Boy, did an unknown actress called Michelle Pfeiffer have a lot to live up to, trying to fill Olivia Newtron-Bomb's disco pants for the Grease sequel's lead role. Maxwell Caulfield paled into cauliflowerish insignificance next to the great dark and sensual John Travolta. Precipitated a host of backyard performances, in which I had to always play the John Travolta role while my skinny blonde mates got to play the girl parts.<br>Amadeus (1984). My heart was well and truly blown away by the combination of Tom Hulce's misunderstood genius, loveable hang-doggie face and that unbelievably tragic end, bawling buckets as he was dumped into the pauper's grave.<br>The Breakfast Club (1985). The great kiddie-yuppie 80s movie where jock meets nerd meets ice-princess/prom-queen meets a couple of cool, misunderstood and sensitive rebels. Judd Nelson was such a spunk as the pained rebel, I coveted Molly Ringwald's leather jacket, diamond earings, cool curly red hair and perfect pouty lips, and even fell for the little blonde dweeb character played by Anthony Michael Hall.<br>U2: Rattle And Hum (1988). Before seeing this in about 1988, I thought my younger sister's obsession with Bono and the boys bordered on the bizarre. Then she dragged me along to this movie. I emerged gob-smacked, delighted, enthralled. When I saw this concert some time later I yearned with every inch of my being for just one droplet of Bono's sweat to fall off him from the stage, hit me, and render me immortal.<br>Throw Momma From The Train (1988). Remembered mostly for the crusty grumpy cartoon character played by Danny de Vito's nasty, demanding mother. Reminds me of great holidays in Hong Kong where I saw it for the first time with great friends in amazing surround sound on then unheard-of laser disc.<br>Wall Street (1989). Adored principally for the cool New York apartment Charlie Sheen got to buy and populate with the glam art dealer played by Daryl Hannah. A special mention for the lavishly 80s pasta and sushi machines. Forget the moral of the story, those two knew how to put greed to good use.<br>Bad Boy Bubby (1994). I notice with dismay my only Australian film, for the pure poetry it produced from despair and depravity. Black, black, black, but with a slick funny streak. Balances on the extreme end of the wit and style common in most Australian movies.<br>Pulp Fiction (1995). Completely satisfying circular chronology with crackling characters and off-the-wall plot twists.<br>Heat (1996) Was stunned into silence by the perfect symmetry between the good and the bad guy, the hunter and the hunted with so much in common. Robert de Niro and Al Pacino were amazing.<br>thirty-something<br>Helen Crompton<br>Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965). The only time the four children from my father's second marriage went to the flix together. I was youngest and didn't understand all the funny bits but laughed when and after everyone else. Terry Thomas frightened me a bit.<br>The Sound of Music (1967). Some woman was reported to have seen this 65 times and the local cinema let her in free after that. I wish they'd paid me to stay away. I have never liked Julie Andrews, she scares me more than Terry Thomas and Doris Day.<br>The Godfather (1972). Too young to get in legit, I wore platforms and blue eye shadow up to my fringe to trick the ticket lady. Saw it with mum and uncle. Was excruciatingly embarrassed by the wedding sex scene. Later my uncle said Sonny was a bull. Thought he meant he was a Taurus.<br>The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976). Manchester's weather couldn't put a damper on this. Sellars hilarity, Rossiter irritability - and Thornton's toffee. The theme music alone puts me in a good mood.<br>Don't Look Now (1979). Donald Sutherland an architect in Venice with wife - Julie Christie, who bugged me less in this than earlier stuff. One of the best horror thrillers since Sound of Music.<br>Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence (1983). London. Tom Conti and whoever that actor was who Conti's character visited on military death row. Cried. Saw it with a boyfriend who said "We make a good team.' I felt sick. Wore the theme track thin.<br>Mona Lisa (1986). There are moments in this when I wanted to marry Bob Hoskins. Pre Robbie Coltrane as a sex symbol days. Bit on pier reminded me of Blackpool when my brother visited from Australia and I thought I'd go for a visit.<br>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1990). Visual genius. Starred my absolute faves Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren. Thought this was celluloid that assaulted all the senses. Boyfriend wanted to walk out - knew relationship was doomed.<br>Brazil (1993). Viewed way after first release. Dark mixture of scorching ideas: Orwell meets Greenaway. More splendid surreal stuff with 1984 overtones.<br>Butterfly Kiss (1995). Brilliant. The Cranberries No Need to Argue put to last frames is sheer genius. Disturbing, desperate and grimly hilarious. Gave it (5) in my flim column and people called me sick. I'm not, honest. It's inspired.<br>forty-something<br>David Watts<br>The Ten Commandments (first seen 1962). Dressed in ?jarmies? my brothers and I would accompany mum and dad to the flicks of a Saturday night. Usually we nodded off just after a Jaffa-soaked interval, but De Mille's epic kept me wide awake. What a sweeping tale, what wonderful special effects. I re-enacted it at school for days, copping strange looks from the older kids.<br>Roustabout (1965). We were allowed to the Saturday matinees with girl cousins who were Elvis mad. Thought this was terrific, especially Little Egypt. Made me want to slick my hair back, buy a motorcycle and pout.<br>The Graduate (1969). The first film I saw at night without my parents. Went with my best mate and we wore flared jeans, T-shirts and sandals and sat near some girls we fancied. Fell in love with Katherine Ross instead.<br>Easy Rider (1970). The first film I attended with a girl at night. And we didn't see it, making full use of the back row for snogging and petting. Her mum picked us up after and our friends did all the talking for us when she asked what we thought of the movie ... she'd actually seen it.<br>MASH (1971). The first film I attended at night with a girl I was actually in love with. We watched, went to her place and talked about how much we enjoyed the irreverence and satire ... and then snogged etc.<br>The Godfather (1972). It's my favourite film. Anytime it's on, I stop everything to watch the marvellous Corleones. My mates and I used to re-enact the restaurant killing scene, but got thrown out of one when the chair I was sitting in broke as I was ?garrotted?.<br>Apocalypse Now (1979). Saw this during my blue period in Melbourne and kept going back to see it. The Ride of the Valkyries scene and the sacrifice of the buffalo at the same time as Martin Sheen disposes of Marlon Brando are probably the strongest images I've seen on film.<br>Gone With the Wind (1980 and at the Gnowangerup Drive-In in 1982). What a yarn. It's a fantastic soap opera and Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are wonderful. I first saw it in Sydney with my first wife who was besotted with it. She and I didn't agree on many things at the time, but I'm glad she took me to this. Seeing it at Gnowangerup was a pleasure. The film didn't start until the management knew everyone was there and similarly the second half didn't start until everyone had been to the cafeteria.<br>Snow White (1988). First of many films I took my daughter to. She was 2½ and neither of us had seen Snow White before. We saw it three times in a week, saw a panto version of it, then a Green, radical feminist version. Lovely story, beautiful music.<br>Braveheart (1995). The second film I saw in my wheelchair, but the first I could hear (the other was Rob Roy and the accents werre farrr too theck laddie). My love of epics remains undiminished and the romance, bloodshed and action was among the best I've seen.<br>fifty-something<br>Zoltan Kovacs<br>The Third Man (1955). The first time I saw it I was too young to understand details of the plot, but was gripped by the atmosphere of suspense and the aura of danger and adventure in which the characters moved. It is a life-long favourite that seems to improve with every viewing.<br>Rebel Without a Cause (1957). Teenagers had only just been invented and I had not long been one when I saw this. James Dean became the embodiment of my generation's adolescent uncertainties. He gave magnificent expression to the impulses to rebellion and anger at adult hypocrisy and injustice in many of us. Times have changed and it has not worn well.<br>High Noon (1957). A cavalcade of cowboys rode across the Saturday morning screen at the children's sessions to uninhibited shrieks of encouragement and the sound of Jaffas rolling down the aisles. Unlike the matinee cowboys, Gary Cooper was a hero for adults and he was the toughest. Here were a spellbinding story and feats of bravery to win the hearts of ladies. We acquired spur-jangling gaits and our twitching hands hovered over imagined hip holsters for weeks afterward.<br>Samson and Delilah (1955). Sorry. Victor Mature, alas, was a hero to a group of us as boys. The way he deals with a lion in this film and sorts out an enemy army with an ass's jaw made him top stuff for boys. I read later that Mature was a wimp who was afraid to get on a horse.<br>Spartacus (1962). My eyes still get misty when Kirk Douglas has to tell his band of escaped slaves that they have been betrayed. It's a huge, sometimes corny effort. But for all its blockbusting pretentiousness, it tells a simple story of the basic need to resist oppressors - an important and reassuring tale in the Cold War years.<br>The Five Pennies (1962). A soppy story is rendered irrelevant by some wonderful music by Louis Armstrong. It was the first time I had seen Armstrong and his inspired trumpet awakened in me an interest in jazz.<br>Dr Strangelove (1965). This is so funny it hurts. The film about the end of the world by nuclear attacks rides on the genius of Peter Sellers, who has several roles.<br>Lawrence of Arabia (1964). The biography by T. E. Lawrence is an overwhelming big-screen epic. In the end Peter O'Toole's Lawrence remains a mystery to be pondered and discussed. It is a moving and disturbing film that lingers in the memory and demands repeat viewings.<br>Midnight Cowboy (1970). The unlikely friendship between the apparently shallow would-be stud (John Voight) and the New York bum (Dustin Hoffman) makes this a strangely haunting film. Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo is at once appalling and appealing. The surface is tough and seedy but the final effect is uplifting.<br>Dead Man Walking (1996). Here is a movie to unsettle middle-age certainties. It exposes both sides of the debate about capital punishment with such force that all but the most headstrong supporters or opponents of the death penalty must have felt pangs of doubt. It made me think more than twice about something about which I have had a strong belief all my adult life.<br>sixty-something<br>Cyril Ayris<br>Mrs Miniver (first seen 1945). Churchill said this war film was worth a flotilla of destroyers. Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson brought genteel romance to a period when romance and gentility were much in need.<br>Goodbye, Mr Chips (1946). I was ensconced in a bleak English boarding school at the time. ?Chips? was relevant to my every waking moment and made me realise that there could be tenderness - even in boarding schools.<br>Joan of Arc (1949). The final scene in which Ingrid Bergman was burned at the stake caused me to blub which was extremely embarrassing, given that my girlfriend was dry-eyed. The film was panned by the critics whom I have studiously ignored ever since.<br>Hobson's Choice (1954). I could relate to the grimy English Midlands town (I was born in one) and was mesmerised by the lugubrious, piggy-eyed, warted-face of Charles Laughton, whose black pudding accent was music to my ears.<br>Showboat (1951). I saw it seven times, purely to hear Paul Robson sing Old Man River. Few voices have moved me so much.<br>Wizard of Oz (1952). My feet barely touched the ground for a week after seeing this 13-year-old film. It wasn't the movie - I had fallen desperately in love with Judy Garland. I agonised over how I could meet her but it was very difficult - she was in America and I was in Africa.<br>The Cruel Sea (1953). in my opinion, the best war film ever made. Jack Hawkins made me so proud to be British.<br>African Queen (1953). Bogart convinced me that leeches were the worst thing that could happen to a person. Thirty-five years later, my fear of them was still with me while on assignment in the jungles of Borneo and Papua-New Guinea.<br>Roman Holiday (1955). My love for Judy Garland was supplanted by Audrey Hepburn after seeing what I still consider to be the most romantic film ever made. A princess in love with a journalist! Maybe that's why I became a journalist.<br>High Society (1957). I saw this at the old Metro Cinema in William Street on my first date with the girl I would later marry.<br>seventy-something<br>Athol Thomas<br>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932). I will never forget the despairing look on actor Paul Muni's face when, at the end of this film about a man on the run, he is asked how he survives. ?I steal,? he whispers hoarsely. Yet he had been a good guy until someone had dobbed him in. From that moment on, I have hated all dobbers.<br>King Kong (1933). A small boy at the time, I was absolutely petrified by this graphic story of an enormous gorilla terrifying New York - even to the point of plucking aeroplanes out of the sky while using the Empire State Building as a stepladder. I resolved never to keep a pet monkey in case it grew too big.<br>Of Mice and Men (1939). This Steinbeck story of two itinerant farmworkers (one a simpleton) yearning for a small farm of their own pointed up the struggle to survive of those born with nothing into an uncaring society. The nobility of one or two of the film's downtrodden would have persuaded me to join the Labor Party, had I been old enough at the time.<br>Casablanca (1942). The combined talents of Bogart and Bergman and the romantic setting of the Moroccan city created a big impression on me: I decided I would have to leave Cottesloe for a more exciting part of the world. But all I did was take up smoking and join the air force.<br>The First of the Few (1942). This film starred Leslie Howard and told the story of the development of the Spitfire fighter - the aircraft said to have won the Battle of Britain in World War II. I wanted to become a Spitfire pilot (but finished up on the ground).<br>Brigadoon (1954). Of all the film musicals I have seen, this one had the greatest charm. - not necessarily because of the music but because, unless you truly believed in it, the village would disappear into the heather on the hill. I have often thought how I would like to retire permanently to a place like Brigadoon - a place where are are no CES offices or Lotto agencies but plenty of pretty redheads.<br>Bad Day at Black Rock (1955). Probably a few people remember this film about a US serviceman (Spencer Tracy) returned from the war and visiting a rural town with a dark secret - its inhuman treatment of its Japanese citizens at the out break of the war. The animosity towards Tracy and the hate expressed for the Japanese made the screen vibrate. I felt the story keenly because I had fought against the Japanese.<br>Lawrence of Arabia (1962). David Lean's direction of this film created, for me, an exciting visual experience of the timelessness and majesty of the desert - and at the same time a sense of wonderment why anyone would want to live in it, or fight for it. (Remember, these were the days before big oil cartels.)<br>Death on the Nile (1986). For anyone who wants to escape briefly from the cruel realities of life, surely there's no better way of doing it than going up the Nile courtesy of Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot - especially when the eccentric detective is played by the marvellous Peter Ustinov.<br>The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994). I saw the outrageous Priscilla on a Saturday afternoon, thus missing the footy. What the film did for me was make me realise that footy need not be our national religion and that Australian film-makers have matured to the point where the rest of the world may soon need to go on fast-forward to catch up. Not that Priscilla was the greatest movie I have seen - but certainly its cheekiness and invention made it one of the most refreshing.<br></font></p>
