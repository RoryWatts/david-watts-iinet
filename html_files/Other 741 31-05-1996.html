            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Denise Calls Up (M)<br>Tim Daly, Alanna Ubach<br>Written and directed by Hal Salwen<br>? ? ?<br>NEW YORK must be the city most featured on film. But in Denise Calls Up, a charming, chuckling comedy, we see a New York unlike any before - no violence, no sex, fleeting nudity, no dirty jokes, no wisecracking street vendors, one wonderful taxi driver and absolutely no car chases.<br>Surely some mistake here. Doesn't New York thrive on dirt and violence? Well, writer-director Hal Salwen has found a totally different city to portray in his debut feature.<br>This is the world of tele-commuters - youngish, affluentish people working from home, constantly on keyboard, fax or phone. They rarely, and in some cases never, meet another human being, let alone touch them physically.<br>Yet in their own way the seemingly bizarre characters of Denise Calls Up touch each other in deep and profound ways without ever meeting. Their instrument is the telephone, which they use incessantly.<br>All types of phones are used in all sorts of situations. The initially shy Barbara (Caroleen Feeney), who is being coerced into a relationship (purely virtual and virtually pure) with Jerry (Liev Schreiber), wears headphones constantly and takes her calls on the loo. So does Jerry, though he has a hands-free set, which enables him to pace the room, smoke and talk all at once.<br>The bouncy, vivacious Gale (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson) is the driving force among the characters, using her cordless like a weapon to bludgeon, then like a harp to seduce friends into relationships.<br>It is she who talks endlessly to Barbara and Jerry's best friend and her ex, Frank (Tim Daly) - often on a second line at the same time - to get Jerry and Barbara together.<br>While doing so she exposes the truth of her own flawed-by-phone life. She hasn't had sex in a year, and the last episode was with the man who came to fix her fridge.<br>And it is Gale who dies by the sword she lived with when she has a fatal car accident - you guessed it - while talking on the car phone. Obviously not hands-free. Her aunt delights in giving the gory details to Gale's friends when they call: ?The phone went straight through her head.?<br>Unlike in other American films, we are spared the actual event, and like the characters of the film, hear about it second hand.<br>For a film with a one-joke theme to survive even 80 minutes and still be fresh, original and clever, there needs to be a bit of sparkle out of left field.<br>That comes in the shape of Denise (a brilliant portrayal by Alanna Ubach), who is eight months pregnant to a sperm donor - they even have sex at safe distances - and has his number.<br>So she rings him on her mobile from all parts of New York, once while on a buggy ride in Central Park, to confirm his fatherhood and find out what he wants to do about it.<br>The father-to-be is Martin (Dan Gunther), who is a ?friend? of Jerry and Frank - but purely on the phone. He is a bright young man, neat and efficient and always at the keyboard, yet he falls, telephonically, for the earthy Denise.<br>They are peas from different pods. He wants to call their child Edward or Robert, she prefers Aphrodite or Penley.<br>The birth is a comic masterpiece. Denise goes into labour, phones Martin, who asks what hospital she's going to so he can join her for the birth. She tells him to stay on the phone because she ?wants him to be there?.<br>Martin dials in Jerry, Barbara, Frank, the taxi driver and the doctor and they are all present at the birth via a conference call.<br>Denise Calls Up is a delightful comedy with a difference and represents an excellent start to the writing and directing career of Salwen, who got the idea for the story when he was locked in front of a keyboard and on the phone all day.<br>Wouldn't you just know it.<br></font></p>
