            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">INTERNET users can now decide for themselves how Microsoft chief Bill Gates is performing in the US Department of Justice's anti-trust case against his company.<br>CNN has an online searchable video database which has all 20 hours of Mr Gates' taped evidence from the trial.<br>All a user has to do is type in a search term or phrase and the site returns excerpts of the videotaped evidence that refer to the search terms.<br>For example, if you type the word ?Netscape? you will be presented with 14 choices of video in which Mr Gates talks about Microsoft's Web browser rival.<br>The excerpts in this example average about 55 seconds to just more than a minute.<br>The user can choose the download and replay speed as well as the preferred multi-media player, which you must have as a browser plug-in.<br>One of the choices is the Microsoft Windows Media Player. The other is the Real Player, made by RealNetworks, a company that has testified angrily against Microsoft.<br>CNN says that portions of Mr Gates' evidence are not being released at the site until they have been played at the trial.<br>IF THE technicalities of Java puzzle you, then the significance of Sun's court victory over Microsoft last week may baffle you equally.<br>However, the Web is groaning with sites that allow users to get a handle on this important case.<br>The Federal Court in San Jose has forced Microsoft to agree to modify Windows 98 to comply with its order in the Sun Java case.<br>Microsoft will have to make multi-million-dollar modifications after the judge ordered it to stop shipping software that illegally used the Sun Microsystems Java program. Microsoft says that users of Windows 98 will not be affected, and that the company will try to stay on schedule to meet demands for the system software even as it is modified.<br>Java, introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1995, potentially allows developers to write a software program once and have it run on a wide variety of computer systems including Macintosh, Unix and Windows. But Microsoft rewrote Java when it included the language in its software so that it would work only on Windows.<br>Last week's court order was made in a case in which Sun accused Microsoft of creating a ?polluted? version of Java that defeats its function as a universal programming language.<br>Microsoft has been accused of trying to stifle Java as part of the company's abuse of monopoly power.<br>One of the best analyses of the decision is at Ziff Davis's ZDNet Anchor Desk site where a list of Microsoft's options is canvassed, and possible ramifications for users and software developers are looked at.<br>Both Sun and Microsoft have published their views on the decision, and Sun has a comprehensive site explaining Java technology.<br>Help Desk<br>CNN Gates video database:<br>www.cnn.com/TECH/<br>computing/video/gates<br>Java court ruling: java.sun.<br>com/lawsuit/111798ruling.html<br>Java homepage: java.sun.com<br>Sun statement: java.sun.com/<br>lawsuit/111798statement.htm<br>Microsoft reaction: www.<br>microsoft.com/corpinfo/<br>ZDNet Anchor Desk:<br>www4.zdnet.com/anchordesk/<br>index.html<br></font></p>
