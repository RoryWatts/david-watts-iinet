            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">The plague of heroin has shocked people throughout WA. The Web has many resources designed to put people in the picture about the drug and its effects.<br>There are sites that offer straight information, those that look at heroin abuse in a much wider societal context, and political sites that let people know how governments claim to be dealing with the problems of addiction and trafficking.<br>A helpful site for parents and students is DrugLinks run by the Centre for Education and Information on Drugs and Alcohol (CEIDA).<br>CEIDA says it is committed to reducing drug-related harm through information exchange and education about alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and the related areas of HIV and other blood-borne infections. It includes a helpful question-answer page which tries to come to terms with queries like these:<br>Why do teenagers use drugs? How can I tell if my child uses drugs? Does smoking cannabis always lead to using other drugs? Where do teenagers get drugs? What if my child starts experimenting with drugs? And most importantly: where can I go to get help?<br>CEIDA offers dozens of links to other drug-information sites plus a library of resources.<br>The Firehorse Webzine presents facts about drugs, most graphically heroin, through a site called End Addiction. This appears to be at least partly aimed at users who want to know what certain drugs are doing to them and how they can get the monkey off their backs.<br>The cold, hard facts are useful for anyone wanting to know more. Wider issues such as drug law reform are tackled at Australian Drug Law Reform site while Families and Friends for Drug Law Reform look at things from the perspective of those trying to find a way out of the mire.<br>The WA Government site has plenty of information for people wanting to know its strategy on drugs. And the government has pages of statistics and information which might also help.Much of it requires the Adobe Acrobat Reader to view.<br>HELP DESK<br>CEIDA DrugLinks: www.ceida.net.au/<br>End Addiction: www.firehorse.com.au/addict/one.html<br>Australian Drug Law Reform: www.ozemail.com.au/ ~petercle/<br>druglaw/home.html<br>Families and Friends for Drug Law Reform: www.wps.com.au/druglawreform/<br>WA Government strategy: www.wa.gov.au/cabinet/mediast/<br>dg97-26/pardrugs.html<br>WA drug data: www.wa.gov.au/<br>cdco/drugdata/index.html<br>Australian Drug Foundation: www.adf.org.au/<br>Adobe Acrobat: Program that translates big documents into an easily read cross-platform format.
