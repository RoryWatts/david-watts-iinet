            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">VIRUS<br>Kill the Explorezip worm<br>www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/<br>story/story-3500.html<br>THE ExploreZip worm is wrecking Windows systems around the world for one reason - Internet users continue to ignore advice and open attachments in unsolicited e-mail.<br>This page from Ziff Davis Net guru Jesse Berst will tell people all about the latest virus scare and give them sound all-round advice about protecting their systems.<br>Berst says millions of users are at risk: ?If you're among them, be very careful with e-mail. Do not open e-mail with attachments unless you're certain the sender is safe, and only after you've downloaded protective software.?<br>The ExploreZip worm - first discovered in Israel - enters Windows 95, 98 and NT systems as an e-mail attachment with the name ?zipped-files.exe?.<br>If it executes, the worm copies itself to the Windows system directory with the filename ?Explore.exe? and then modifies the WIN.INI file so the program executes each time Windows starts.<br>It then uses the infected computer's e-mail client to harvest e-mail addresses so it can propagate itself. Behind the scenes, it searches through C to Z drives and selects crucial file extensions, rendering them useless by making them 0 bytes long.<br>ANTI-CENSORSHIP<br>Prairie Dog<br>www.prairie-dog.net<br>PERTH woman Bernadette Taylor recently hit the headlines by claiming that government workers around Australia had been using taxpayer-funded computer time to leer at the Web-cam pictures she posts of herself at her Virtual Girlfriend site.<br>Now Ms Taylor has beefed up her Web presence with this site protesting against the Federal Government's Net censorship legislation.<br>It includes a long list of the government addresses she says have been looking at her intimate pictures. But its main feature is a well-constructed analysis of the legislation and her opinion on why it will not work.<br></font></p>
