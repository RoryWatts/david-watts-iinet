            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">GOAL to Jakovich, exclaimed Channel 7's Kevin Bartlett as Brendon Fewster maintained West Coast's first-quarter demolition of Geelong.<br>Jakovich was some distance away, perhaps trying to understand Guy McKenna's jokes or practising vivisection on a helpless pussycat, or whatever it is that resurgent champion centre half backs do.<br>Bartlett's mistake was just one of many examples of mistaken identity on the box in the past few days.<br>After the former Richmond star had reminded viewers eight times that Andrew Donnelly had replaced Chad Morrison in the Eagles selected side, one of the commentary team still managed to call Morrison as a contributor in a passage of play in the third quarter.<br>But it was the player formerly known as Whiskas who made the biggest blue of the match.<br>Garry Hocking handballed a point from a spot in front of goals from which even my late grandmother - who never saw a game of football in her life - would have kicked a goal.<br>The Hocking blunder caused much mirth in the Seven box, with Bartlett, formerly known as Hungry, joking that he would have handballed in a similar situation.<br>As far as we know, there are men in wheelchairs at homes for the elderly still waiting to receive a Bartlett handball.<br>Sadly, Hocking's blunder was not the worst mistake of round 13.<br>That dishonour goes to Shane Parker's ill-directed kick-in that allowed Richmond's Ben Hollands to kick the winning goal against Fremantle.<br>Pity that Seven caught only the ball landing in Hollands' arms. The tension and anxiety of Parker's moment was missed because of a slow-motion replay.<br>Some method must have been behind Seven's madness on Saturday night when the station allowed Rex Hunt and his radio colleague Anthony Hudson to call the game between Carlton and the team formerly known as North Melbourne.<br>No doubt the move was made to remind viewers that no matter what we think of Bruce McAvaney's gushing, Sandy Roberts' shouting or Bartlett's mistakes, they are all superior to a night out with the Bearded Burbler.<br>Hunt's calls rate well on Melbourne radio, but his repeated ?jokey? mispronunciations of Camporeale and Koutoufides and his constant nicknaming (Dean Special Fried Rice), became annoying by about the 10th minute.<br>ADD to that Hudson's attack of the Bartletts - ?Adrian Hickmott passes to ... ah, um, Adrian Hickmott? - and was it any wonder that Mick McGuane with his ?leg speed?, ?scoreboard pressure? and ?small crumbing-type players? made the only sense?<br>Mistaken identities reigned in other sports, too.<br>Lleyton Hewitt, formerly known as a tennis brat with a penchant for tiresome ego-pumping, looked suitably humble as Boris Becker showed him how champions play and behave at Wimbledon.<br>Channel 9 viewers who have stayed up late enough for the tennis will have noticed another tele-blunder.<br>The screen insists on telling us that the matches are live.<br>Carlton president John Elliott would deal with that by saying, ?pig's? ... but I can't go on; this is a family newspaper.<br></font></p>
