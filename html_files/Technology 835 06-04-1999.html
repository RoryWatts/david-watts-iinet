            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THE Sam Newman-Nicky Winmar row on the Footy Show has highlighted the growing relationship between sport on Australian television and the Internet.<br>Channel 9 runs the big Ninemsn site in conjunction with Microsoft and uses it to promote its major shows.<br>When Newman impersonated Western Bulldogs footballer Winmar by applying black make-up, he unleashed a controversy about racial stereotyping. The controversy was played out as much at the Footy Show's site as anywhere else in the mainstream media.<br>The popular Sam's Mailbag spot on the show is mirrored on the Web. But during the row, the Web mailbag devoted itself to letters about the incident where the TV show left the mailbag to more general topics.<br>Ninemsn displayed a range of e-mails which showed Net-connected viewers were split about 50-50 on whether Newman had gone too far.<br>One viewer wrote: ? ... the original comments were quite amusing. Sam, however, had to go one step further and it no longer was funny when he blacked-up.?<br>She was supported by another: ?It was an insult to Nicky and you should apologise. Nobody deserves that sort of humiliation.?<br>Others wrote that Newman had their full support. ?Keep making us laugh Sam. That is what you do best,? said one.<br>Web surfers can fire off e-mails to Sam's Mailbag and read recent letters simply by going to the site at any time. They do not have to wait for the show on Thursday nights.<br>The Footy Show has expanded its Web presence dramatically since last season. The mailbag is not only more up-to-date, but segments such as Street Talk and big interviews can now be seen in video clips.<br>Last year the site revolved mainly around articles by Newman, host Eddie McGuire and comedian Trevor Marmalade. They were not always updated regularly.<br>The irony is that AFL football is not Nine's sporting brand. Its main drawcard is cricket, though the station has made strong statements this year that it thinks AFL rights should be split among networks and that it will pursue the rights vigorously in 2001.<br>With cricket, Ninemsn has tied itself with CricInfo, the Web's leading repository of news, views and trivia related to the game.<br>The partnership between TV and sport is further emphasised by the Australian Cricket Board's move to the Ninemsn-CricInfo mega site. Until early this year the board had run its own site, displaying schedules, pictures, press releases and statistics.<br>A criticism was that it stayed away from controversy which directly affected it, such as the Mark Waugh-Shane Warne bookie row.<br>But its move to Ninemsn-CricInfo has board business directly linked to CricInfo's big array of cricket news sources where controversy is always simmering.<br>If Nine can be said to have recently hopped into bed on the Web with its main sporting partners, then Seven could be described as well and truly married. The network's big sport is AFL football and it shares input to the official AFL site with that body and Rupert Murdoch's newspapers.<br>Seven provides the site with video clips, details of programs, a Sandy Roberts audio summary and other virtual appearances by its football talking heads.<br>The AFL has an official area where it distributes press releases online, plus its merchandising arm. News and views are looked after by News Ltd papers and as a result there is a disproportionate amount about the Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide.<br>Seven's main network site is much simpler than Ninemsn, providing mere snippets of information and directing surfers to the AFL site for football topics.<br>But it does provide its point of view on the development of Melbourne's Docklands in which it has a big interest, and appears to be developing a Web entry to its coming coverage of the Sydney 2000 Olympics.<br>The ABC uses a site called the Score to showcase sport it has a particular interest in, though it attempts to have coverage of everything.<br>At the moment it has a special link to the Australian cricket tour of the West Indies.<br>Neither SBS nor Channel 10 appears to have developed specialised Web interests linked to the sports they cover.<br>HELP DESK<br>The Footy Show:<br>sports.ninemsn.com.au//AFL/<br>FootyShow/Content.asp<br>AFL:<br>www Score:<br>www.abc.net.au/news/<br>sport/default.htm<br></font></p>
