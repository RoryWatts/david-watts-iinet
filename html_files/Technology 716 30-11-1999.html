            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">NOVEMBER has seen two of the year's biggest Internet developments.<br>That goes without even mentioning Judge Thomas Jackson's anti-trust findings against Microsoft.<br>Both developments have everything to do with what are often seen as either the Net's strengths or its weaknesses - access and reliable information.<br>The first was the successful launch early in the month of an Encyclopaedia Britannica Web site that makes all 32 volumes of text available free to anyone on the Net ... a boon for researchers and information freaks.<br>The second was last week's announcement of an ACTU deal designed to make computers and Net access cheaper for two million Australian workers.<br>Under the deal, Virtual Communities, a company run by businessman Chris Clarke, will offer trade unionists the latest IBM Millennium 2000 for $9.50 a week over a three-and-a-half-year period.<br>Members of AFL clubs and Catholic Church parishioners are also being targeted. Church groups are reported to have made acceptance conditional on filtering software to reduce pornography.<br>The bottom line will be ownership of a reasonable home computer and Net access from Primus Telecom for only $1482 over three-and-a-half years, or about half the going rate.<br>The deal has the potential to eat into the so-called digital divide which has so far made the Net the preserve of the haves against the have-nots.<br>An Australian Bureau of Statistics report in May found that the two mostly frequently reported main reasons for not having a home computer were ?no use for a computer? and ?costs too high?.<br>A total of 37 per cent cited that they had no use while 27 per cent gave high costs as the reason for not having a computer.<br>Of those with a computer, but no Net access, 30 per cent said high costs stopped them going online.<br>The US Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration released an online report earlier this year called Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide. It observed that households with incomes of $75,000 and higher were at least 20 times more likely to have Net access.<br>The information rich were white or Asian, had higher incomes, were more educated and lived in dual-parent households.<br>By contrast the information poor - or have-nots - had less income and education levels, and lived more in rural areas or central cities.<br>T HIS digital divide was exercising the minds of some of the world's most influential leaders last week.<br>US President Bill Clinton told a conference in Florence that in a bid to close the divide, every classroom in the US would be hooked to the Net by the end of next year.<br>He said the Net could generate opportunities for people without traditional jobs, claiming that auction site eBay was helping 20,000 make a living.<br>His enthusiasm was echoed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair who told the same conference the inroads made by the Net meant that governments had to start empowering people and giving them access to knowledge.<br>HELP DESK<br>watto@iinet.net.au<br>Free Britannica: www.britannica.com<br>Virtual Communities:<br>www.virtualcommunities.com.au<br>ACTU: www.actu.asn.au<br>Defining the Digital Divide:<br>www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/<br>contents.html<br></font></p>
