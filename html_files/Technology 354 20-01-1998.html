            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Bill Gates is said to be the world's richest man with a personal fortune of $40 billion and growing. But his power, not his money, is exercising many minds right now.<br>The US Justice Department's contempt claim against Mr Gates' Microsoft, taking issue with the Seattle company forcing sellers of new PCs to bundle Internet Explorer with Windows 95, has led to a much sharper focus on his intentions.<br>The world's most identifiable nerd has almost always been close to centre stage on the Web. Microsoft is the operating system on 80 per cent of the world's computers already. Some analysts are predicting that Internet Explorer's erosion of Netscape's dominance in the browser market will make Microsoft king of the Web as early as June or July.<br>By extension, Mr Gates, who created the company, will be the man in charge of how we see both our desktops and cyberspace. If you have installed Internet Explorer 4.0 on a PC, you will probably have an idea of this melding of desktop and Web.<br>Some like it for its logic and ease; others loathe it for taking away choice and for taking over the system. Whatever, Mr Gates has many other projects that aim to blend various media with a dominant Microsoft flavour.Consider these examples put late last year by the Columbia Journalism Review in a feature called Will Gates Crush Newspapers?Microsoft and NBC have formed MSNBC, an all-news cable channel with an online capability that lets computer users explore, on demand, the stories they're interested in.<br>In Australia, a similar alliance has been formed with our richest man, Kerry Packer, to form NineMSN.<br>The stated aim in both cases is to sign up customers who will pay to have personalised news services delivered to their desktops.Last June, Microsoft paid $1.5 billion - its biggest investment - for an 11.5 per cent stake in Comcast, the US's fourth-biggest cable system operator.The Microsoft Web site Sidewalk - with arts and entertainment listings, restaurant reviews, and tourism guides - is available in a steadily growing number of cities, including New York, San Francisco, Washington and Sydney, and is seen as a direct challenge to conventional newspaper advertising.Last April, Mr Gates paid $650 million for WebTV Networks, a maker of set-top boxes that enable people who don't own a computer to explore the Web via their TV sets.<br>Last week, Business Week produced a special online edition entitled Microsoft's Future. It poked into every nook and cranny of the Gates world. Among its thousands of words, it delivered these findings on what it termed Microsoft's Expanding Universe:On the Net, MS has 16 different Web sites with money-making hopes. Sidewalk is looking for a slice of local listings markets around the world, said to be worth $36 billion.The Expedia travel site is responsible for more than $3 million in travel bookings a week, according to MS.The survey site, Media Metrix, has ranked MSNBC ahead of USA Today and CNN in most-visited news sites.Forrester Research says Microsoft's CarPoint is one of the top online car sales sites, expected to generate $150 million by 2001.<br>It is a breathtaking resume, even in this short summary that does not list the big money-makers, such as operating systems (86 per cent of the market last year) and productivity suites (87 per cent).<br>No wonder the publisher of the New York Times, Arthur Sulzberger, introduced Mr Gates at a newspaper convention this way: ?Microsoft increasingly competes against almost everyone in this room for readers' time and advertising dollars. If you don't consider it a competitor today, in this increasingly digital world in which we live, all I can say is, "Wait'.?<br>Where it leaves users like you and me is a matter of great, and much needed, debate. Mr Gates does not own the Net, despite what his harshest critics believe, so there are many forums where you can put your viewpoint, or just listen to the arguments about whether the rise of the Microsoft empire is a good thing. The Help Desk has a few helpful starting points.<br>Watts Online is taking a two-week holiday.<br></font></p>
