            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">Author Donald Horne will be remembered forever for christening Australia the Lucky Country. He did it ironically, but has suffered 30 years of people twisting the phrase for self-congratulation during boom times.<br>Horne's exact words in the opening sentence of the last chapter of the book he wrote in 1964 were: ?Australia is a lucky country, run by second-rate people who share its luck.?<br>But, to twist the phrase yet again, Australia still must be considered a lucky country - or certainly luckier than a host of others - when talking about the Internet.<br>The Net here is not only a popular medium, but also a reasonably free place to express opinions or exchange views . . . and to find government information.<br>Both the Federal Government and the WA Government have made good progress at using the Web to convey essential information.<br>Perhaps it is not the members of either parliament who are responsible for this growing Net-savviness. Indeed, when Federal Cabinet feted Microsoft chairman Bill Gates like royalty earlier this year, members of Prime Minister John Howard's staff said they doubted that their boss had been on the Net.<br>But digitally aware public servants or outside contractors have produced a wide array of mostly good looking and easily navigable sites for nearly every department or agency run by either government.<br>Netizens who need deeper looks at how governments use the Web - and how politics in general is starting to put down roots in cyberspace - need only look at David Moss's Australian Politics site.<br>It has links to all levels of government, the major parties, lobby groups and topical events such as the waterfront dispute.<br>Consider the latest government site due to be launched officially today.<br>It is Justice Online, run by the WA Ministry of Justice. The site is full of useful information like where to go to trace your family roots, or how long people have to wait for cases to be heard at different courts.<br>A measure of an affluent state, though, is that information provided by government can actually be fun to read.<br>One of the great surprises at Justice Online is under the facts and figures section, where lists of the most popular baby names in WA have been drawn up.<br>Did you know, for instance, that the top five boys' names last year were Joshua, Matthew, Jack, Daniel and Liam? Or that Jayden, Brandon and Connor now all outrank the once popular David?<br>The top girls' names were Jessica, Emily, Sarah, Emma and Georgia. Tayla was more popular than Taylor and there was a good showing from Brooke, Maddison and Shannon, but no mention of either Mary or Elizabeth.<br>Contrast this ability to extract heavyweight information and light trivia from a government with what is available in China, Cuba or North Korea.<br>An organisation known as the Digital Freedom Network has decided to do something about the absence of freedom of speech that affects millions.<br>It recently launched a site that it says ?fulfils the promise of the Internet by providing millions . . . with free access to information that had previously been difficult or impossible to find?.<br>The international non-partisan partnership, working with free speech and human rights organisations, publishes censored material on its Web site.<br>DFN hopes that the power of the Net to circumvent restrictions on free speech will put pressure on authoritarian regimes.<br>On view at the site last week was an article by Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng; a letter from another Chinese dissident, Bao Ge; and a letter from a jailed Cameroon journalist.<br>Banned poems by a Cuban activist and the story of a Kenyan dissident also featured.<br>Australians might well consider themselves lucky after reading these.<br></font></p>
