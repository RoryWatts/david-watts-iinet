            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">AUSTRALIAN Football is WA's main code, far outstripping soccer and both rugby codes for participation, spectator interest, club membership, media coverage, sponsorship and passion.<br>It is the main winter sport in Victoria, SA and Tasmania as well, and is growing healthily in the ACT, NSW and Queensland. The spread of the game can be attributed in big part to the transformation of the Melbourne-centred VFL into a national competition - renamed the AFL in 1990 - with teams from Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane.<br>Footy had its origins on the Victorian goldfields where miners played a crude mix of rugby and gaelic football.<br>In 1857 a Tom Wills returned to Australia after schooling in England where he was football captain of Rugby school and a brilliant cricketer. Initially he advocated the emerging winter game of football as a way of keeping cricketers fit during their off-season.<br>The new game was devised by Wills, his cousin H.C.A. Harrison, W.J. Hammersley and J.B. Thompson. The Melbourne Football Club was formed on August 7, 1858, the year the first recorded game was played between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar school.<br>The game blossomed quickly. Geelong Football Club was formed in 1859. The code crossed the Nullarbor and the WA Football League started its competition in 1885.<br>The Victorian Football League was established in 1896 and the first games were played among the foundation clubs Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne the following year.<br>Interstate football between Victoria and South Australia started in 1899 and by 1914 Victoria was involved in matches against WA, NSW, Tasmania and Queensland. New Zealand fielded a team at the 1908 carnival in Melbourne.<br>Around the world:<br>AFL was shown on TV in these countries and by these programs last year:<br>US: ESPN2 - 1-hour highlight program; Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>UK: BSkyB - 2-hour match of the round; Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>Spain: Canal + Television - 1-hour highlights; 2-hour match of the round; Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>New Zealand: Sky - 1-hour highlights; Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>Fiji: Fiji TV - Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>SE Asia: ABC's Australian Television - 1-hour highlights; Live telecast every Saturday and Sunday.<br>STAR - 1-hour highlights.<br>NBC Asia - 1-hour highlights.<br>Japan: STAR - 1-hour highlights.<br>GAORA - 2-hour highlights of every finals game.<br>Nauru: Nauru Television - 1-hour highlights; 3-hour match of the round; Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>South Africa: M-Net Supersport - 1-hour highlights; Grand Final live and/ or delayed telecast.<br>VFL/ AFL premiers:<br>1897 Essendon; 1898 Fitzroy; 1899 Fitzroy; 1900 Melbourne; 1901 Essendon; 1902 Collingwood; 1903 Collingwood; 1904 Fitzroy; 1905 Fitzroy; 1906 Carlton; 1907 Carlton;1908 Carlton; 1909 Sth Melbourne.<br>1910 Collingwood; 1911 Essendon; 1912 Essendon; 1913 Fitzroy; 1914 Carlton; 1915 Carlton; 1916 Fitzroy; 1917 Collingwood; 1918 Sth Melbourne; 1919 Collingwood.<br>1920 Richmond; 1921 Richmond; 1922 Fitzroy; 1923 Essendon; 1924 Essendon; 1925 Geelong; 1926 Melbourne; 1927 Collingwood; 1928 Collingwood; 1929 Collingwood.<br>1930 Collingwood; 1931 Geelong; 1932 Richmond; 1933 Sth Melbourne; 1934 Richmond; 1935 Collingwood; 1936 Collingwood; 1937 Geelong; 1938 Carlton;1939 Melbourne.<br>1940 Melbourne; 1941 Melbourne; 1942 Essendon; 1943 Richmond; 1944 Fitzroy; 1945 Carlton; 1946 Essendon; 1947 Carlton; 1948 Melbourne; 1949 Essendon.<br>1950 Essendon; 1951 Geelong; 1952 Geelong; 1953 Collingwood; 1954 Footscray; 1955 Melbourne; 1956 Melbourne; 1957 Melbourne; 1958 Collingwood; 1959 Melbourne.<br>1960 Melbourne; 1961 Hawthorn; 1962 Essendon; 1963 Geelong; 1964 Melbourne; 1965 Essendon; 1966 St. Kilda; 1967 Richmond; 1968 Carlton; 1969 Richmond.<br>1970 Carlton; 1971 Hawthorn; 1972 Carlton; 1973 Richmond; 1974 Richmond; 1975 Nth Melbourne; 1976 Hawthorn; 1977 Nth Melbourne; 1978 Hawthorn; 1979 Carlton.<br>1980 Richmond; 1981 Carlton; 1982 Carlton; 1983 Hawthorn; 1984 Essendon; 1985 Essendon; 1986 Hawthorn; 1987 Carlton; 1988 Hawthorn; 1989 Hawthorn.<br>1990 Collingwood; 1991 Hawthorn; 1992 West Coast; 1993 Essendon; 1994 West Coast; 1995 Carlton; 1996 Nth Melbourne.<br>WAFL premiers:<br>First premiers: 1885 Rovers; 1886 Fremantle; 1887 Unions; 1888 Unions; 1889 Unions.<br>Since 1960:<br>1960 West Perth; 1961 Swan Districts; 1962 Swan Districts; 1963 Swan Districts; 1964 Claremont; 1965 East Fremantle; 1966 Perth; 1967 Perth; 1968 Perth; 1969 West Perth.<br>1970 South Fremantle; 1971 West Perth; 1972 East Perth; 1973 Subiaco; 1974 East Fremantle; 1975 West Perth; 1976 Perth; 1977 Perth; 1978 East Perth; 1979 East Fremantle.<br>1980 South Fremantle; 1981 Claremont; 1982 Swan Districts; 1983 Swan Districts; 1984 Swan Districts; 1985 East Fremantle; 1986 Subiaco; 1987 Claremont; 1988 Subiaco; 1989 Claremont.<br>1990 Swan Districts; 1991 Claremont; 1992 East Fremantle; 1993 Claremont; 1994 East Fremantle; 1995 West Perth; 1996 Claremont.<br>Did you know:<br>IN 1916 Fitzroy won the wooden spoon and the premiership. World War 1 forced five of the nine VFL clubs into recess. Carlton, Collingwood, Richmond and Fitzroy played a 12-round season. Fitzroy ended on the bottom of the ladder with a 2-9-1 record. But the final four system was still used, and in a form reversal Fitzroy won all its final matches, beating Carlton in the grand final.<br>Stats and facts:<br>Most premierships: 16, Carlton (most recent 1995), 15 Essendon (most recent 1993)<br>Wooden spoons: 26, St Kilda (most recent 1988)<br>Highest score: Geelong 37.17.239 v Brisbane, 1993<br>Lowest: St Kilda 0.1.1 v Geelong, 1899<br>Most goals: game: 18, Fred Fanning (Melbourne) v St Kilda, 1947.<br>Season - 150, Bob Pratt (South Melb) 1934; Peter Hudson (Hawthorn) 1971<br>Longest winning sequence: 23, Geelong round 12, 1952 to round 13, 1953<br>Losing sequence: 51, University Round 4, 1912 to Round 18, 1914<br>Longest premiership drought: 67 years, St Kilda 1899-1966<br>Still to win: Brisbane (joined 1987); Adelaide (joined 1991); Fremantle (joined 1995) and Port (joined 1997)<br>Yet to win wooden spoon: Carlton (joined 1897); West Coast (joined 1987); Adelaide (joined 1991); Fremantle (joined 1995) and Port.<br>Oldest player: 43, V.

This has been bettered three times by WAFL players. South Fremantle's Bernie Naylor kicked 167 in 1953 (156 in normal season and 11 in finals). Austin Robertson kicked 157 in 1968 for Subiaco. George Doig kicked 152 for East Fremantle in 1934.<br>Fred Fanning's 18 goals in a game record in the VFL/ AFL has also been beaten on numerous occasions, with Naylor kicking 23 and 18-goal tallies in 1953 and 19 in 1952. George Doig and George Moloney each kicked 19 goals for East Fremantle and Claremont in 1934 and 1940 respectively.<br>1996 WAFL ladder:<br>PWLDForAgst%Pts<br>EAST PERTH21147-19601566125.1556<br>CLAREMONT21147-19381565123.8356<br>E.
