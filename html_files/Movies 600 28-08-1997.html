            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">ALBINO ALLIGATOR H H H ½<br>Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects) makes a solid directing debut with this twisty hostage drama set in a New Orleans bar. Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise and William Fichtner play three low-rent thieves whose bungling causes them to accidentally intersect with a major police operation in which two agents are killed. The inept trio take refuge in a bar and soon find themselves at the centre of a siege, with the bar surrounded by cops, broadcast vans and curious onlookers. While the performances are terrific all round, as you'd expect with a fine actor like Spacey calling the shots, the real star of the piece is the clever, probing script by 25-year-old Christian Forte (son of 50s pop singer Fabian). He' has taken a stock movie situation, with criminals of varying sympathies and the hostages growing increasingly desperate, and pushed it so far that we keep wondering what we'd do in the same situation. Some will find it too theatrical, with its one-set locale and speeches, but fully rounded adult drama with genuine ethical questions is so rare these days that Spacey's move behind the camera is to be welcomed. Screening at the Luna. Rated MA. (Mark Naglazas)<br>FACE/OFF H H H H ½<br>While most action movies don't have plots worth wasting a second on, Face/Off has such a deliciously intriguing set-up that the gun play and explosions which follow seem almost irrelevant. In the perversely audacious opening, a small boy is gunned down, setting his father, Sean Archer, the head of LA's counter-terrorist unit (John Travolta), in a to-the-death search for the killer, an evil genius named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Sean eventually gets his man but when the cops learn of the comatose genius' plan to wipe out the city, his only course of action is to borrow Castor's face (yes, quite literally) and to trick his whacko brother into spilling the beans. Further face-swapping occurs, allowing director John Woo to explore his favourite theme - that under the skin there's little separating good guys from bad. Travolta and Cage have an absolute ball playing each other, picking up on little mannerisms yet retaining their own essential natures. And when it comes time for Woo to let rip with those made-in-heaven action scenes, we at last get a chance to see the Hong Kong maestro of mayhem do his stuff on a Hollywood-sized budget. Face/Off is simply the most outrageously entertaining movie of the year. Rated MA. (Mark Naglazas)<br>GABBEH H H H ½<br>This quiet, extremely beautiful fairytale about a woman whose father will not allow her to marry her horseman suitor is further evidence of Iran's destiny as the next powerhouse in international art cinema. Gabbeh is the name for the brightly coloured, exquisitely crafted rugs that are woven by the nomadic people of Iran. It's also the name of the love-sick woman, a figure on a rug who magically comes to life to tell her tale of woe to an old couple arguing about who is going to wash the gabbeh. Originally intended as a documentary about a vanishing way of life on the Iranian steppes, director Mohsen Makhmalbaf has gone deeper, fashioning a dreamlike expression of the inner lives of these tradition-bound nomads. Using a deceptively simple style yet filling almost every frame with breathtakingly bright colours - each highly symbolic colour, we learn, is woven into the very fabric of their lives - Makhmalbaf brings a humanity and understanding to what are normally sociological curiosities. Screening at Cinema Paradiso. Rated G. (Mark Naglazas)<br>SMILLA'S FEELING FOR SNOW H H<br>Unsmiling Miss Smilla may have a special feeling for snow, but Bille August, who has adapted Pete Hoeg's literary phenomenon, cares not a skerrick for the basic conventions of the thriller. August and cinematographer Jorgen Persson have done wonders in evoking the chilly atmospherics of Hoeg's story about a part-Inuit woman named Smilla Jasperson (Julia Ormond), whose investigation of the death of a young boy takes her from mid-winter Copenhagen to Greenland's frozen coast. However, when it comes to building tension and orchestrating an action sequence, August (a Dane best known for art movies such as Pelle the Conqueror and The Best Intentions) has all the panache of a flamenco dancer in a pair of snow shoes. The problem is that thriller mechanics are about all there is to Smilla's Feeling For Snow. Stripped bare of any psychological examination of Smilla and the other enigmatic characters in the novel, August's movie comes across like second-rate James Bond. And Ormond's chilly performance doesn't help. She sweats to evoke her character's feeling of alienation and loneliness but comes across as a morose spoiled brat. Rated M. (Mark Naglazas)<br>ADDICTED TO LOVE H H H H<br>If Tom Hanks saw leather-clad, mouthy Meg Ryan in this twisted tale of two forlorn dumpees who take revenge on their respective dumpers - "The only way that girl is coming back to you is if a blast of semen catapults her across the street,? she snarls - he'd not just be sleepless in Seattle but bolting all the doors. It's an unholy marriage of romance and black comedy but first-time director Griffin Dunne manages to strike the right balance. Rated PG. (Mark Naglazas)<br>ABSOLUTE POWER H H ½<br>Clint Eastwood tries to bring a Hitchcockian lightness of touch to this thriller about a cat-burglar who stumbles on a murder and a trail of blood that leads to high places. The problem is that the film lurches between being a dark, disturbingly relevant drama about sexual deviance and corruption in high places and a Mission Impossible knock-off with Clint as the man of a thousand funny wigs. Rated M. (Mark Naglazas)<br>AUSTIN POWERS H H H ½<br>Mike Myers (of Wayne's World fame) had the good sense to yank Austin Powers, a cross between a Carnaby Street swinger and a Bond-like super-spy, out of the 1960s and into the politically correct 90s. While his mouthful of crooked teeth (legacy of bad British dental care), purple crushed-velvet suit and foppish ruffled cravat are amusing, his outmoded self-deluding macho attitudes - "How "bout a shag, baby? is his best come-on line - get the biggest laughs. Rated M. (Mark Naglazas)<br>BRASSED OFF H H H<br>There's much to like about this stirring British comedy-drama about a mine closure that threatens the future of a long-standing colliery brass band, especially the heartfelt performance of Pete Postlethwaite as the band's leader, Danny. But writer-director Mark Herman avoids the really interesting questions, such as the logic of supporting a filthy business that's sending Danny to an early grave, choosing instead to wallow in working-class sentiment. Rated M. (Mark Naglazas)<br>CARLA'S SONG H H H<br>It's a pity that Ken Loach doesn't maintain the subtlety of the lovely, lyrical first half, in which a high-spirited bus driver (Trainspotting's Robert Carlyle) strikes up a relationship with a tormented political refugee named Carla (Oyanka Cabezas). By the time the couple travel to Nicaragua to seek out Carla's missing lover, Loach gets heavy-handed, throwing in lefty stereotypes such as singing guerillas, a faceless enemy and ?shocking? revelations about CIA-backed Contra activities. Screening at the Luna. Rated M. (Mark Naglazas)<br>CONSPIRACY THEORY H H H<br>Mel Gibson has played delusional paranoids before (Hamlet, Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs) but he's never had as much fun as he does with Jerry Fletcher, a taxi driver who believes in just about every fruitcake conspiracy theory ever hatched. The problem is that Gibson's goofing around injects unnecessary levity into what is supposed to be a serious-minded thriller, leaving love interest Julia Roberts as baffled as the audience. Rated M. (Not Previewed)<br>DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS H H H H<br>Ostensibly about the struggles of a transsexual looking for acceptance, Different For Girls thankfully avoids cliches and titillation in favour of a more intellectual and emotional approach to the gender, personality and identity issues that arise after a sex change. It's helped by very engaging performances from Rupert Graves (of Room With A View fame) and Steven Mackintosh (last seen, ironically, in the Shakespearean gender-bender Twelfth Night) as old friends who strike up the kind of relationship that has been the butt of jokes in the school shower block. Rated MA. (Sue Yeap)<br>FACE/OFF H H H H ½<br>While most action movies don't have plots worth wasting a second on, Face/Off has such a deliciously intriguing set-up that the gun play and explosions which follow seem almost irrelevant.

Face/Off is simply the most outrageously entertaining movie of the year. Rated MA. (Mark Naglazas)<br>FEVER PITCH H H H ½<br>Based on Nick Hornsby's autobiographical best-seller about a mad-keen Arsenal supporter who is forced to choose between his team and his woman, Fever Pitch is as much about finding a family, responsibility and hanging on to your childhood dreams. Even non-footy fans should find something to laugh at in this understated and charming romantic comedy. Rated M. (Sue Yeap)<br>FOR ROSEANNA H H H<br>Thankfully the Americans only supplied the money (and the sexy Mercedes Ruehl) for this solidly European production about a restaurateur (Jean Reno) who works overtime to keep his fellow citizens of a small Italian town safe so his dying wife can have a burial plot next their beloved daughter. What might have been overblown and over-sentimental in the hands of a Hollywood schlock-meister is treated with taste and restraint by Brit Paul Weiland, who gives the movie a lovely bittersweet quality. Rated M. (David Watts)<br>SLING BLADE H H H ½<br>BILLY BOB THORNTON gives an astonishing performance as Karl Childers, a monosyllabic naif who has spent 25 years in a mental institution after murdering his mother and her lover. While this low-key Oscar winner is to be applauded for its restrained approach to a subject that might have collapsed under the weight of melodrama and sentiment, it's a pity that it doesn't push a little harder in exploring its theme of innocence defiled and purifying retribution.
