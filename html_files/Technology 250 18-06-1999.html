            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">DON'T panic, the Earth is safe at last . . . it now has its own version of the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy.<br>And Douglas Adams, the author of the science-fiction comedy that grabbed world attention in the 80s, is behind the latest effort to provide information about life, the universe and everything.<br>Adams has thousands of willing helpers. His new hitchhikers' guide is called h2g2 and it is available only on the Web.<br>The thousands of helpers are the Net users who have registered at the site as official guide researchers.<br>H2g2 is in exactly the same vein as the original Hitchhikers trilogy of books. It treats the truth with its tongue firmly in its cheek and in doing so may prove to be one of the funniest Web sites yet.<br>When he launched the site a month ago, Adams said his aim was to create a ?real guide, where real information will be stored for future generations?.<br>He should have pulled the other one.<br>Thanks to h2g2 being thrown open to the public - who can contribute chapters on anything from bus timetables to opera reviews - future generations will be able to read about Australia in the following terms: ?The creature that kills the most people each year is the common wombat. It is nearly as ridiculous as its name and spends its life digging holes in the ground, in which it hides. During the night it comes out to eat worms and grubs,? the guide says.<br>?The wombat kills people in two ways: First, the animal is indestructible. Digging holes in the hard Australian clay builds muscles that outclass Olympic weightlifters. At night, they often wander the roads. Semi-trailers (road trains) have hit them at high speed, with all nine wheels on one side, and this merely makes them very annoyed.?<br>It goes on at great length about our oddities and curious friendliness.<br>Similar games are played with the truth in hundreds of other chapters. And h2g2's extraordinary range of interests is guaranteed to increase steadily.<br>Within 24 hours of the site's launch, more than 3000 people registered as researchers, page counters estimated that Web surfers looked at 50,000 articles in the guide, 1500 messages were posted and 1200 pages created.<br>People interested in becoming h2g2 researchers should go to: www.h2g2.com<br>Use of the Don't Panic button is recommended for those who have trouble with what is becoming a crowded connection.<br></font></p>
