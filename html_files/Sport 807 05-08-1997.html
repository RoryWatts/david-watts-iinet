            <p align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">THIS may sound silly, but the biggest battle in the AFL at the moment is to see who will get the football.<br>It is not a scrap between Michael Gardiner and Daniel Bandy, or any other players for that matter.<br>The ruckmen in this case are named Packer and Murdoch, and they want the football for TV. The rights to broadcast AFL from 2002 have somehow become part of the bid to build Victoria Stadium in the docklands of Melbourne. The stadium will house 50,000 and by 2030 is expected to be the property of the AFL.<br>Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd aligned itself with one stadium tenderer in mid-July. Reports from Melbourne suggest a figure of $40 million was thrown on the table for first and last refusal to the rights to broadcast football as part of the bid.<br>Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd - a 15 per cent shareholder in the Seven network - then threw its weight behind another tenderer to which Seven had attached itself.<br>The winner of the Docklands development battle is expected to be known by the end of the month.<br>The AFL insists it will have the last word on who gets the rights. Chief executive Wayne Jackson has said that the Docklands contract has nothing to do with broadcasting agreements.<br>This fails to explain why PBL and News Ltd have found it necessary to support a stadium-building project.<br>Nine's attack sent Seven into a state of gloom when first revealed. The Melbourne Age reported that network boss Kerry Stokes made a special in-house interview with Bruce McAvaney to allay staff fears that its biggest drawcard - 600 hours of AFL a year - would not be lost.<br>What it means for viewers is difficult to say at this stage. A lot can happen in the next five years.<br>If Nine does win the rights, its on-air line-up may look nothing like it does now.<br>However, Eddie McGuire could be a reasonable frontman, though lacking McAvaney's smoothness and all-round knowledge.<br>Little would be lost in dropping Don Scott and Sandy Roberts for Dermott Brereton - making a reputation on pay-TV as a worthy expert - and, say, Jason Dunstall.<br>The Rex Hunt spot would most likely be filled by Max Walker, who lets his panel get out of control even more than the ?Bearded Burbler?.<br>THERE would be some likely transfers and drafting as well. I cannot imagine footy lovers, West Australians particularly, warming to the sport without Dennis Cometti. Leigh Matthews and Ross Glen- dinning could not be passed over easily.<br>This would leave a lot of talking heads in limbo. What to do with Ian Robertson, Tim Watson, Kevin Bartlett and Russell Morris for a start?<br>A Nine win might not be good news for NSW and Queensland AFL fans because it holds the rights to Super League until 2005, and has a long-term agreement with the Australian Rugby League.<br>Many cricket lovers I know dread Nine getting anywhere near footy. The network's fondness for owning a product and then showing too little of it - and putting on bad movies instead of crucial passages - infuriates many.<br>Nine's bid could be just the thing to spur Seven into improving aspects of its coverage. The three wise men high in the stands is becoming passe.<br>Optus Vision's AFL channel apparently has commentators at different parts of the ground ... far better than injured players eating pies and adding cliches.<br></font></p>
