  <p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial">1999 update:<br>
  </font></strong>Sadly, it's been all downhill since about February. I started the year
  working out twice a week in a gymn. By March I no longer had the stability nor energy to
  continue as symptoms on my &quot;good&quot; side worsened.<br>
  Looking through this chronology, there are several references to increased numbness,
  tingling, tightness and weakness on my right side of body and left side of face. These
  started to make their presence felt in a big way from February. By May I was concerned
  enough to get back on the medical merry-go-round. An MRI showed the brainstem clear except
  for some white spots . . . miraculous in a way but there was obviously a lot of activity
  going on in the brainstem still.<br>
  The shock was the appearance of a small, new tumour in the left frontal lobe. This is not
  in a dangerous spot and is causing no grief. But its existence is both baffling and
  worrying.<br>
  By September, I was very much weaker, more in the wheelchair and had no peripheral vision.
  I had a biopsy on the frontal lobe to see what sort of cells made it up. They are
  astrocytoma, grade 2, which is what has always been suspected in the brainstem where no
  biopsy was possible.<br>
  Since September I have become gradually worse -- the stabilising and improving benefits
  brought on by radiotherapy in 94-95 have obviously stopped.<br>
  I now feel quite weak in my right hand and leg and am barely able to stumble to the
  bathroom. Eating is a slow and messy affair because of swallowing problems. It is very
  hard to sit at a keyboard and type, but I still write four columns a week because the work
  takes me out of myself.<br>
  It is December 1 as I write this and I am waiting to hear&nbsp; when I start a trial of
  Thalidomide,which has shown some promise at stopping blood supply to tumour cells.<br>
  It might be a long shot but I'm going to give it a go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font face="Arial">1998 update:<br>
  </font></strong> Not much to add in 1998. Same old story; slight worsening of field of
  vision in &quot;good&quot; eye and more numbness in left side of face BUT definitely
  stronger. In August I started working out a gymn twice a week to build up tone and
  strength, and to see if the brain could find new nerve pathways to move paralysed bits . .
  . some slight success so far.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>12/93 - blurred vision, slight slurring of speech.</li>
        <li>1/94 - family doctor suspects benign tumor, CT scan is clear.</li>
        <li>2/94 - MRI shows lesion, neurologist suspects glioma or MS</li>
        <li>3/94 - lumbar puncture and evoked potentials test rule out MS. wear eye patch because of
          double vision, otherwise fine and working 12 hours a day.</li>
        <li>4 and 5/ 94 - some weakness and tingling in left arm and leg.</li>
        <li>6/94 - second opinion from neurologist, yes glioma; neurosurgeon rules out biopsy
          because he says it could be fatal, says that area of the body is &quot;tiger
          country&quot;. cut working hours and do less stressful work.</li>
        <li>7 , 8 and 9/94 - more weakness and slurring of speech.</li>
        <li>10/94 - very weak left side, walk with crutch, embarrassed about speech. physician
          recommends radiotherapy against advice of neurologists. have been having acupuncture and
          meditating plus chi gong and substantial diet changes since 6/94.</li>
        <li>11/94 - MRI shows no discernible change in lesion. barely able to walk, right side
          starting to weaken and tingle, depressed, muscle wasting.</li>
        <li>12/94 and 1/95 - 30 daily sessions of radiotherapy. things seem to get worse. start
          taking anti-depressants (aropax) and pain killers for tightness in head. unable to close
          right eye voluntarily. left eye loses some lateral movement, but vision remains clear.</li>
        <li>2 and 3/95 - unable to walk, in wheelchair, left arm paralysed, right side of face
          paralysed. start having reflexology and reiki weekly. physician says only three or four
          months to live because of risk of pneumonia caused by throat weakness which affects
          swallowing.</li>
        <li>4 and 5/95 - spirits improve, incredible support from friends and parents come across
          the country to help our little family.</li>
        <li>6/95 - small amount of movement returns to left arm and hand.</li>
        <li>7/95 - very stable, a little more improvement in left side, feeling stronger and more
          energetic. turn 41</li>
        <li>8/95 - thinking of working from home, family doctor says neurologists surprised at
          stability.</li>
        <li>9/95 - go to AFL grand final in Melbourne. find details of tamoxifen and stereotactic
          radiosurgery. slight increase in numbness left side of face. start working from home 20-30
          hours and 2-3 internet related stories a week. start regular swimming.</li>

          weekly; go to movies every Tuesday; going out more; speech clearer; feel stronger.</li>
        <li>11/95 - swimming up to 400m. return to work one day a week. ride electric scooter or
          gopher, able to go out on own. MRI on 21/11 ... <b><font SIZE="+1">TUMOR SHRINKS SLIGHTLY </font></b>.</li>
        <li>12/95 - have a great Christmas. put on 5kg with festive food and drink.</li>
      </ul>

      <td valign="top"><p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial">1996-97</font></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/96 - still stable; working ca 40 hours a week, mostly at home. take much needed and
          delightful family holiday. lots of swimming plus water aerobics.</li>
        <li>2/96 - right side slightly weaker BUT left side stronger. more numbness in left side of
          face.</li>
        <li>3/96 - nothing dramatic. swimming 300m plus 100m &quot;water walking&quot; a week.</li>
        <li>4/96 - deterioration more evident in weakening right side and more numbness in left side
          of face and back of head. For a week or two it was worrying then seemed to stabilise and
          improve marginally, so that by the end of the month I didn't feel too much worse. I missed
          swimming for about three weeks and also had no reiki for the whole month. This no doubt
          contributed to the feelings of weakness.</li>
        <li>Discovered on the Net that <a HREF="http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/tumor/index.html">Columbia
          University</a> is running clinical trials of chemotherapy for people with brainstem
          gliomas. I e-mailed them, but was not eligible.</li>
        <li>5/96 - Seemed to get stronger as the month went on. Face still feeling number on the
          left. BUT able to walk --- or stagger --- round the house more, mostly with the aid of a
          frame. Being at full height is a pleasure.</li>
        <li>6/96 - Doing a lot more walking - staggering actually - but it keeps my hips and legs
          strong. Left rear side of the head around the ear is tender and painful at times. Water
          walking 400m a week. Interviewed on video for palliative care professionals and wrote
          about the Net's influence on my illness for <a HREF="http://www.theage.com.au">The
          Melbourne Age</a>.</li>
        <li>7/96 - Bit more numbness in the head, but doing more walking and benefitting by
          exercising tired old muscles. Wrote <b><a HREF="myb.html">My Story</a></b> for The West
          Australian which got very positive reaction from throughout WA. Turned 42, which we all
          know is &quot;the meaning of life&quot;.</li>
        <li>8/96 - More of the same. Bit stronger and able to walk more. In fact am climbing stairs
          . . . coming down is the problem and need support.</li>
        <li>9/96 - An up and down month. There were times when I felt strong as ever and others when
          I felt down with more facial numbness and pain in the head. My story was published in <b><a
          HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a></b> in London; I started two new columns
          -- on life and TV sport -- for The West Australian and was interviewed by <b><a
          HREF="http://www.abc.net.au">The ABC</a></b> for the <b>7.30 Report</b>.</li>
        <li>10/96 - Not a great month. Felt generally weaker. Plus I had a terrible dose of the flu,
          immobilising and scaring me. Fever, loss of left side totally, hardly able to speak or
          move. I slept for two days then miraculously everything returned to where it had been.
          Felt better the second half of the month with a strong return to swimming.</li>
        <li>11/96 - A better month. Just a slight increase in tingling on the right side of body,
          and discomfort in the left side of head. Tried to add a column about <a
          HREF="http://www.waec.wa.gov.au">the WA election</a>, but had too much on to do it
          justice. Redesigned <a HREF="index.html">My Home Page</a>. <a
          HREF="http://www.christmas.com">Christmas</a> is coming . . . looking forward to that.</li>
        <li>12/96 - Lovely Christmas again. A little fuzzy in the head at times.</li>
        <li>1/97 - Rollicking start to the New Year with lots of parties, a beach holiday and more
          outings than normal. Feeling good after sluggish start to year. Body seems to have
          accommodated what change there has been in slowly weakening right hand and leg. Went
          fishing for the first time in 2 1/2 years . . . as usual no luck.</li>
        <li>2/97 - Felt quite strong nearly all month and there was hardly any change physically.<br>
        </li>
        <li>3/97 - A few coughs, colds and congestions made me feel less able than normal and
          accentuated weaknesses in the face and body. <br>
        </li>
        <li>4/97 - A good month with very little to report. We're about to extend our little house;
          a project we'd all but shelved after I was diagnosed. But I can see six months ahead now
          without fear.<br>
        </li>
        <li>5/97 - Not much happening, although on the home front our building extensions grow ever
          nearer. Lots of looking at taps, toilets, doors etc <br>
        </li>
        <li>6/97 - Wasn't a great month. The slowly creeping numbness on left side of head increased
          to stage where it was much more noticeable, harder to open mouth, harder to speak, tighter
          round neck, generally glummer. My body remains strong however.<br>
        </li>
        <li>7/97 - I made my 43rd birthday in good shape. All the little changes of past few months
          seem to have settled down and/or I have adapted to them. Had a holiday in the wine country
          of Margaret River and returned home to find extensions to our house going at a great rate.
          Walking with crutch nearly all the time.<br>
        </li>
        <li>8/97 - Walking a lot; more tightness so it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. <br>
        </li>
        <li>9/97 - More of the same. Go to Melbourne for the <a href="http://www.afl.com.au/">AFL&nbsp;grand
          final</a> and have a great time, seeing among other things the <a
          href="http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/rembrandt/index.html">Rembrandt exhibition</a> at the
          National Gallery.<br>
        </li>
        <li>10/97 - We move back home and it it feels good, lots more space and light. The left side
          of my face is noticeably tight, harder to talk because my mouth will not open properly and
          I have a narrower field of vision because the left eye has lost some movement. But I'm
          walking all the time.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>11/97 - Feel bit brighter after trauma of moving house. No big changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>12/97 - Very busy Christmas. Full on with family, friends and kids. More noticeable
          changes in left eye movement. Have less mobility and also more tingling in right arm and
          leg.</li>
