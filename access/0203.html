    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#95B4EC"><h1><strong><font face="Arial">The young and the
    childish </font></strong></h1>
    <p><strong>NEVER doubt that the world of computing and the Internet is a young one and
    thus prone to serious bouts of childishness and irresponsibility. Children, teenagers and
    young adults have a huge advantage over their parents and guardians in the information
    age.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>New technology guru Nicholas Negroponte summed it up when he said: &quot;For
    them (children), computing is like air; they don't notice it until it's missing. They
    manage without reading manuals. We used to depend on kids to program our VCRs. Now we must
    turn to them for help in understanding our digital future.&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston spoke last year of the Net
    Generation: the six million Australians aged between two and 22. Their mastery of what to
    older people is still referred to as new technology &quot;signals the absolute
    inevitability of digital technology in our life&quot;, he said.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>However, it can be exasperating watching those experienced with computers, but
    inexperienced in life.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Example one -- my 10-year-old son was using the Web to find some information
    about the Aboriginal Dreamtime for a school project (a hard task, by the way, because
    search engines return dozens of commercial sites selling Dreamtime paintings before any
    with hard facts are looked at). I asked him how it had gone. &quot;Not bad, but the best
    bit was getting on a chat line and pretending to be a 29-year-old nuclear physicist from
    Houston,&quot; he said. Ah well, we used to pretend to be Texas Rangers and romp around
    the bush on pretend horses, I guess.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Example two -- Someone, and by the nature of the content you have to assume
    they may not shave yet, has been posting to hundreds of Usenet newsgroups with astounding
    news about a revolutionary program. Their message: &quot;Skin Reveal 0.9 beta is here.
    This is the only software on the Net which is capable of revealing human skin by removing
    the FF0cA1A2 code line in JPG images. You can scan your friend's image, and use this until
    you expose his (or her's) covered body parts.&quot; A Web address where the free program
    could be downloaded was given, but the page did not exist. In an earlier age, this person
    would have been flogging X-ray spectacles no doubt.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Example three -- An 11-year-old English boy has made some useful pocket money
    -- $27,000 to be exact -- because of his ability to handle CD-Roms and CD burners. Trouble
    is, his endeavours were illegal. The BBC reported last week that the boy from Sunderland
    was the brains behind a computer game piracy operation. He copied CDs of popular games
    such as Tomb Raider in the privacy of his bedroom. His parents had no idea what was going
    on, presuming he was just playing games and getting to know his PC. But the European
    Leisure Software Publishers Association smelt a rat when it was called in after bootlegged
    copies of top PC titles began appearing in big quantities at the boy's school in
    north-east England. ELSPA will not be pressing charges, despite software piracy becoming a
    &quot;very huge problem&quot; and increasingly the target of professional criminals.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The 11-year-old's operation was pretty small fry. The BBC said the average
    piracy bust was usually valued between $50,000 to $70,000.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The boy's father said: &quot;He'll not be doing that again.&quot;</strong><br>
