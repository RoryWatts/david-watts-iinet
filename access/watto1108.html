    <td valign="top" width="450"><strong>IT MUST be tough being the world's richest man. As
    hard as that is to believe, consider what is happening to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.</strong><p><strong>Everyone
    wants a part of him, not just his money but his time as well. Earlier this year Fortune
    magazine estimated Mr Gates's personal wealth at more than $80 billion (Australian
    dollars). With rises in Microsoft's share price, this amount has undoubtedly grown.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This amount of wealth led US consumer advocate <a
    href="http://www.essential.org/antitrust/ms/rn2bg7-27.html">Ralph Nader</a> late last
    month to suggest to Mr Gates that he and fellow billionaire Warren Buffet should be doing
    more to help their fellow man. Letters on the World Wide Web between Mr Nader and Mr Gates
    spell out the situation.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On July 27, Mr Nader told Mr Gates that the Seattle software king's income was
    greater than the combined net worth of the poorest 40 per cent of Americans -- 106 million
    people. Their wealth -- or lack of it -- was calculated by including their home equity,
    pensions and mutual funds.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;As might be expected, on a worldwide plane, wealth disparities are
    staggering. According to the United Nations Development Program, the assets of the world's
    358 billionaires were greater than the combined incomes of countries with 45 per cent of
    the world's people (about 3 billion human beings),&quot; Mr Nader wrote.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;Let me suggest that you team up with (Warren Buffet) . . . to sponsor,
    plan and lead a conference of billionaires and multi-billionaires on the subject of
    National and Global Wealth Disparities and What to Do About It. With the dual sweep of the
    Gates-Buffett hands, the serious and consequential plight of humanity would become a
    matter of high alert for those business colleagues and acquaintances of yours who aspire
    to move from success to significance,&quot; Mr Nader's challenge went on.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Last Tuesday, <a href="http://www.essential.org/antitrust/ms/bg2rn-8-4.htm">Mr
    Gates replied</a> that he was delighted Mr Nader shared his personal interest in
    philanthropy and emphasised a well-publicised statement that he (Mr Gates) intended to
    give away the bulk of his wealth during his working life.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>As an example of his philanthropy, Mr Gates pointed out that he had endowed two
    foundations with more than $1.5 billion (Australian) already. He also cited his <a
    href="http://www.glf.org">Gates Library Foundation</a> which aims to allow all Americans,
    regardless of income or social status, free Internet access at public libraries.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;I do encourage everyone I know to participate in philanthropy. However,
    philanthropy is very personal. I think people should give because they want to give, and
    not because of pressure from a conference or anyone who claims they have all the answers
    in this area,&quot; Mr Gates said.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Mr Nader responded last week that Mr Gates had missed the point about convening
    a conference of the wealthy to address the issue of fairer distribution. There is bound to
    be more, but the score seems locked at 15-all for the moment.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This argument about what to do with the Gates fortune is not restricted to the
    powerful like Mr Nader.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>At the resourceful <a href="http://www.zpub.com/un/bill/">Unofficial Bill Gates
    Page</a>, a link leads to a <a
    href="http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=0002l7">forum</a> where
    the subject is open for discussion among average Netizens. The suggestions are many,
    varied and colourful. One says Mr Gates should form an army and take over a Third World
    country &quot;like any dictator&quot;.</strong><ul>
      <li><strong>Others include:<br>
        * &quot;I think that Bill Gates should give me $10,000 for my 17th birthday in July so I
        can buy a car.&quot;<br>
        * &quot;Share it with struggling individuals like myself. I'm not asking for much. $50,000
        would help me to get out of debt and start my own business.&quot;<br>
        * &quot;Bill Gates should help out with training for single mothers who find it impossible
        to pay for a Microsoft training.&quot;<br>
        * &quot;Give it all to me, you (expletive deleted).&quot;<br>
        * &quot;Maybe he could buy a football team or two. Heck why not buy the NFL.&quot;<br>
        Actually there are many sensible, thoughtful suggestions too. All in all a wonderful
        example of how the Net can focus energies on a problem.<br>
        . . . as long as it is to do with someone else's money. </strong></li>
