    <p><strong>IN THE spirit of Ebenezer Scrooge, I would like to report there is a fair bit
    of baah-humbug around this festive season. Two things I hope do not turn up in my
    Christmas stocking are an America OnLine subscription and an iMac.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I took advantage of <a href="http://www.aol.com.au">AOL's free 100-hour trial</a>
    last month, and cannot see much to recommend it to WA people who want to get online. Many
    local ISPs like iiNet and Wantree, and the big Australians at Telstra Big Pond and
    OzEmail, offer better value for money with much less fuss. (see <a
    href="http://www.cynosure.com.au/isp/">list of ISPs</a>).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>AOL can be very cheap at $9.95 a month. This gives the user only 15 hours
    unfortunately. It is $4 an hour after that. There are other pricing plans, but better
    value for people who want to use the Net is provided by local companies, several of whom
    offer unlimited use for a flat rate of between $35 and $40 a month.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>If you connected for even 50 hours (or about 80 minutes a day) with AOL, it
    would cost nearly $150. Fine then for a light user. But the heavy-handed, hand-holding and
    focus on AOL content and channels through its proprietary interface is a turn-off.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Logging on to AOL is easy, but then the user is presented with more multiple
    choices than a TEE exam. You can go to your e-mail box. That takes two screens. Or you can
    find answers to frequently asked questions. I wanted to know how to terminate my account.
    It meant opening six screens (and then closing them) to discover there is no answer and
    you have to make a phone call.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A simple browse of the Web would have been good, but the proprietary browser
    which uses Internet Explorer as its engine often failed to deliver, even when AOL's
    channels were firing up nicely, indicating connections were okay. I started using my
    Netscape browser with far greater success, and with a feeling of being freed from AOL's
    big brother presence that, even though it is trying to help the less experienced, gives an
    oppressive feeling of being made into a passive consumer of AOL-approved goodies.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Obviously these comments are from an experienced Net user and therefore not the
    newbie AOL is targeting. But all I can say is there are faster, less complicated and
    cheaper ways to get connected.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Now I know <a href="http://www.apple.com.au">iMacs</a> are all the rage, the
    hope of the company and look pretty on the desktop. The feeling I got when I first saw one
    last week was of terrible deja vu, however. Even in all its transparent, designer-colour
    glory, the iMac reminds me of the first computer terminals I had anything to do with back
    in 1981.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>They, too, were just one solid, bubble-shaped unit with a keyboard. You could
    never hope to upgrade them, nor add new components. You can add lots of peripherals easily
    to an iMac, but its one-piece design gives the appearance that you cannot do much to boost
    its inner workings.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And it has no floppy drive. That seems remarkably short-sighted. A floppy is a
    super way to transfer small files and get PC-using recalcitrants on to a Mac To me, an
    iMac looks as trendy as the Bay City Rollers . . . with similar longevity.</strong></p>
