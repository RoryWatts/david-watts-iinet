    <p align="left"><em><strong>* Australians should go <a href="http://www.download.net.au/">here</a>
    and search for Star Wars for faster, local downloads.</strong></em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>FIRST an apology. My browser survey is not ready for public
    release. For a start I am not totally happy with the sample size. There have been 75
    responses from readers to the six questions about browser use posed on <a
    href="watto1011.html">November 10</a>.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Thanks to all those who e-mailed responses so quickly, and for the comments
    attached. I would like a few more reactions, however; perhaps getting the number up to an
    even 100 for a broader assessment.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>By the way, a cursory browse of responses shows Netscape the overwhelming
    favourite.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>One of the other reasons for the lateness in providing results is that I got
    distracted. This is so easy to do on the Web. One minute you are saying &quot;I must have
    a look at the survey&quot;, the next there is this site that you just must see . . .
    linked to another, even better and so on. Even if you are new to the Web, you will know
    what I mean.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>So, when I should have been calculating survey results I was watching the
    preview of the new <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/trailer/">Star Wars
    prequel</a>. As were millions of others. The BBC reported last week that the launch on the
    Web of the &quot;rushes&quot; for Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace has created
    on-line congestion not witnessed since the publication of the Starr Report.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This may surprise serious types because the two-minute Star Wars preview
    contains only fleeting jerky images and pretentious text. The &quot;Starr Wars&quot;
    report into President Bill Clinton's sexual activities, by comparison, contains material
    that threatens a presidency. But never under-estimate the power of George Lucas's films,
    particularly with the Internet community who consistently vote Star Wars the best film of
    all time.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Star Wars, made in 1977, may have been the first of the blockbusters, but it is
    actually only episode four of a series. The Web preview -- and the trailer being shown to
    huge American audiences in cinemas -- is of episode one. The official Star Wars site was
    the only place outside selected North American cinemas that people could see the trailer
    early last week. Dozens of unofficial sites have since sprung up.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>At the sites you can watch the trailer in RealPlayer, Quicktime or .avi
    formats. Episode one, which features stars such as Samuel L Jackson and Ewan McGregor,
    tells the story of the young Anakin Skywalker at the start of his journey to becoming
    arch-villain Darth Vader. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>The hype for the film is such that two-thirds of the 500-strong audience for
    Denzel Washington's The Siege at a Los Angeles cinema walked out after the Star Wars
    trailer had finished. The BBC reports that film distributors have sought to encourage
    cinema-goers to stay by repeating the trailer at the end of films as well.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This is just the trailer. Imagine what will happen when the whole film is
    released next May. </strong></p>
