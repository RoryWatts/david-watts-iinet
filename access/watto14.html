    <td><font face="Arial">LAST week I learnt about the fax of life. As the spelling suggests
    this education was not at somewhere like the tasteful Sexuality Bytes site run by Channel
    9 on the Web. This was a less sensuous lesson and, like much in home computing these days,
    directly linked to Microsoft.</font><p><font face="Arial">It was all to do with Windows
    98, the operating system now three weeks old and still causing great discussion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The most asked question, judging by observations of threads in
    newsgroups and the chatter in email discussion groups, is whether it is worth upgrading
    to. As we know the hype for 98 has barely been hype at all, especially when compared with
    the fits Microsoft had with Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">As many also know by now, that lack of hype is justified because 98
    is far from revolutionary, offering instead a more reliable platform than 95 and
    occasionally a faster one . . . provided you have at least 32Mb of RAM and a Pentium 133.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Following the progress of these questions on whether to upgrade
    inevitably leads to disgruntled users letting off steam. One such thread last week
    concentrated on the subject of fax. At first sight, that does not look touchy at all, yet
    it generated far more heat than any other 98-related discussion I have seen. By the way,
    it is certainly a good sign for Microsoft that a utility like fax, and not system
    integrity, is causing waves. It means that perhaps the Seattle giant has a reasonable if
    unremarkable OS on its hands.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Back to the fax. The initial query that started all the discussion
    about whether 98 is worth getting was in a Perth newsgroup and went roughly like this:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Okay, I give in . . . for the life of me I couldn't find the
    fax components . . . I tried to send a fax from Word only to get an error saying Mail not
    installed. Mail for fax? Of course, how logical. <br>
    &quot;Nonetheless, I couldn't find any reference to that in the Windows Setup section of
    the Add/Remove Programs control panel either. Windows Help was less than helpful, saying
    how to view and edit faxes, but not how to send and receive them.<br>
    &quot;As for Win98 support on the Microsoft site -- on clicking on the Support button on
    the Win98 home page, one gets: HTTP Error 404.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">There followed many responses with suggestions ranging from
    &quot;read the manual&quot; (RTFM in email-speak) to &quot;stick to Linux&quot;. At one
    stage there was nearly a virtual brawl with one correspondent threatening to punch another
    in the nose (down the phone line presumably).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">But eventually it was discovered that the new 98 does have the old
    Microsoft fax, but it is buried deep on the installation CD-ROM in a file called
    Tools/Oldwin95/Message/US/Awfax.exe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Very simple really. But if you have the Outlook 98 email and general
    organisation program, it also has fax capabilities. To get them you have to connect to the
    Windows Update site on the Web and request the Symantec WinFax Starter Edition. This then
    downloads and installs itself automatically and allows users to send faxes as if they were
    sending emails. But they work best if fax numbers are in the email address book.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">When a fax number is typed in the To: field of an email form, the
    address must be in the form fax@phone number.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">It is all so simple . . . not.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Users might be better advised to install a fully functional
    third-party fax program. And those are the facts of life.<br>
