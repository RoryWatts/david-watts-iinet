    <td><font face="Arial">BE AFRAID, be very afraid. Just when you thought you were coming to
    grips with this still new medium of the Internet, the goalposts are shifted . . . again.</font><p><font
    face="Arial">I speak here of those of us who have learnt some basic HTML (Hyper Text Makup
    Language); maybe got as far as tables or frames, and have made some simple Web pages. Or
    those who are about to embark on this quest which can help them join the millions of
    vanity publishers out there.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><a
    href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/01/xml.idg/index.html">CNN reported</a> with
    relish last week that HTML is all but dead. It is shuffling off to join Mosaic browsers,
    blinking headlines, rainbow gifs and the surprising number of objects the Web has managed
    to make irrelevant or redundant in its short, but exciting life. Soon we will have to
    learn XML (Extensible Markup Language) to keep abreast of the trendies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Before I try to explain what XML is, it might be educational to look
    at the state of the average Internet user. There are 1.5 million of us in Australia. On
    average we are likely to be professional males aged between 25 and 35.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">But statistics are cold things. It is what is in the average Net
    user's head that is really interesting. Given that most grew up when computers still
    required a warehouse for 300Mb to reside in, many still have certain phobias about the
    brave new world. I, for one, believe little green men run around inside controlling
    everything. The technical term for this is hardware-challenged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Others might find the following -- passed on by a discussion group
    correspondent -- more accurate portrayals of their state of computer-literacy:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>If you are a man, then computers can be just like your
    better half:<br>
    </strong>1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.<br>
    2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to
    everyone else.<br>
    3. The message &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; is about as informative as, &quot;If
    you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell you.&quot;<br>
    4. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br>
    5. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your money on
    accessories for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>On the other hand, women might associate certain bloke
    characteristics with their PCs:<br>
    </strong>1. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br>
    2. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br>
    3. As soon as you commit to one you realise that, if you had waited a little longer, you
    could have obtained a better model.<br>
    4. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br>
    5. Big power surges knock them out for the rest of the night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">As for XML . . . I am not going to tell you much because that would
    be far too nerdy in the context of this column. Suffice it to say that XML will require
    far more disciplined writing than HTML, particularly in regard to syntax and strictness in
    observing upper-case, lower-case regimes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The resultant Web pages promise to be far more flexible and
    informative, overcoming the vaguaries that different systems and different browsers
    produce. The XML writer will regain control of his pages which will look exactly as he or
    she intended on all platforms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">For a lot more information -- and despite the levity of this column,
    XML will be an important subject in the next 12 months -- see the Help Desk.</font></p>
