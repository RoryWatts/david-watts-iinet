    goes on<br>
    despite warnings<br>
    </font><font face="arial"></font></strong></h1>
    <h5><strong><font face="Arial">By David Watts</font></strong></h5>
    <p><strong>WARNINGS flew last week, but they did nothing to slow the booming trade in
    Internet-related stocks.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On the one hand:<br>
    * The world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan,
    warned that the lure of Net stocks was creating a lottery mentality among investors who
    were piling their money into companies destined to go bust.<br>
    * Wall Street's top regulator, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    Arthur Levitt, urged investors to take a breath and remember traditional rules.<br>
    * Charles Schwab, chief executive of the popular online traders, told clients that his
    company would be limiting access &quot;at times&quot; to Web trading in certain stocks
    because the Net-related market was so hot that demand for trading was exceeding the number
    of shares available.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>But on the other hand:<br>
    * News Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch shrugged off earlier much-quoted reticence about
    the Net to put his company into a partnership with the Web's main search engine site,
    Yahoo!. The promotional deal between the two companies was launched during the Superbowl
    -- shown by Murdoch's Fox television. Yahoo! will be advertised during Fox's televised
    sporting events, while Yahoo! will promote a variety of Fox properties, including Fox's
    cable stations and Internet sites like Sports Net and FX, Fox TV and news, Fox Music, and
    the Twentieth Century Fox film studio.<br>
    * Yahoo! announced it was buying GeoCities Inc for $US4.6 billion. The deal creates the
    biggest Web gateway. Geocities, with a history of losses, reportedly has 53 million visits
    to its site each day, and hosts millions of free Web pages created by average users.<br>
    * Compaq Computer triggered another round of alliances in Net business by hiving off its
    AltaVista search site as a separate company, leading to a public offering that could be
    worth $US2 billion. Microsoft, a long-standing Compaq ally, endorsed the deal and said it
    would adopt AltaVista as the primary search engine of the Microsoft Network.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Guardian in London reported that the DOT index of leading companies
    involved in Net commerce has risen 34 per cent so far this year. By comparison, the Dow
    Jones Industrial Average is unchanged and the Nasdaq composite index is up 11 per cent.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In Australia, Net-related prospects also kept the market buoyant. This level of
    activity -- described by Mr Schwab as a hot market -- is reflected in visits to financial
    Web sites.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Where Did We Go list of 100 most-visited Australian sites had 17 finance
    URLs in its rankings for January. Commonwealth Securities Share Direct, an offshoot from
    the Commonwealth Bank site and which allows online trading, was ranked fourth in a list
    topped by the Australian Open site.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>One of the stronger finance performers was Perth online broking firm Sanford
    Securities, which was the 38th most visited site. Sanford deputy managing director Steven
    Goh says the firm is the country's second biggest Net broker.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>It rated well ahead of both Macquarie and E*Trade in the January list.
    &quot;Unlike any other stockbroking firm in Australia, we've developed all the code
    ourselves,&quot; Mr Goh said. &quot;In this regard, we're unique and for this, we were a
    finalist in the E-commerce category of the AFR awards, and a finalist in the 1997 AIIA
    awards for technical excellence.&quot; </strong></p>
