    <h1 align="left"><strong><font face="Arial">Clinton's moment of truth</font></strong></h1>
    <h4><font face="Arial">By David Watts</font></h4>
    <p><strong>INTERNET users will not be surprised to learn they can virtually bury
    themselves in Web coverage of the Clinton impeachment trial. What might surprise, however,
    is that the best coverage is at British sites.<br>
    <br>
    President Clinton's moment of truth for his indiscretions with Monica Lewinsky and
    subsequent actions has been propelled on to the world stage mainly by the Net. First, the <a
    href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> dragged up the dirt on the affair.
    Then millions of people were able to read every salacious word of the Starr Report on
    their screens. This was followed by online video of the President's testimony to the Grand
    Jury.<br>
    <br>
    Naturally with a user base and sheer volume of sites dominated by Americans, news about
    the impeachment trial is unavoidable. Every US news organisation has a special site. But,
    with few exceptions, the deluge of stories and analyses is hard to wade through.<br>
    <br>
    The more dispassionate UK heavyweights at the <a
    href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/clinton_under_fire/latest_news/default.htm">BBC</a>
    and the <a href="http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/Clinton_in_crisis/0,2759,14780,00.html">Guardian</a>
    have far easier Clinton specials to follow. Their ability to go to the important issues,
    rather than to cover every word uttered about the case, makes them ideal places for
    non-Americans.<br>
    <br>
    The BBC complements its coverage in words with video snippets of the case that can be
    played with RealPlayer. It also offers the now mandatory feedback page where surfers can
    have their say about the trial's progress.<br>
    <br>
    The Guardian's new newsUnlimited site requires users to register, but that is free. The
    Clinton special can be found under the Documentaries link, and one of its highlights is a
    comprehensive list of jokes about the affair.<br>
    <br>
    None of this is to say that American sites should be ignored. The <a
    href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/clinton.htm">Washington
    Post's</a> exhaustive coverage is a must, considering the trial is in the paper's
    backyard. And <a href="http://cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/index.html">CNN's AllPolitics</a> site
    will provide news and video footage as it breaks. It also offers a searchable video
    database of Mr Clinton's Grand Jury testimony.<br>
    <br>
    The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> is Net savvy and the President was
    quick to make his official views on the impeachment available online as soon as they were
    ready. There is bound to be more at the White House site as the trial continues.<br>
    <br>
    The better US sites to watch are perhaps those that offer distractions.<br>
    <br>
    The <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> fits this description. Matt
    Drudge, the sleazy character who offers gossip as news, actually has an excellent site for
    those who want to be informed. His Clinton special links to the Washington Post, but he
    has a myriad of links to other news organisations. Drudge's own stories can be
    entertaining to say the least. Last week he wrote that an online video re-enactment of Mr
    Clinton's trysts with Ms Lewinsky is planned for release later this month. <br>
    <br>
    For those who receive good streaming video on fast connections, <a
    href="http://www.real.com/realguide/special/impeach/">RealPlayer's guide</a> to the trial
    is worth watching. This site links to a wide variety of different organisations showing
    RealPlayer coverage in video or audio.<br>
    <br>
    One site that cannot be ignored is <a
    href="http://www.zdnet.com/yil/content/specials/washscandal/clinton.html">ZDNet's Y-Life</a>.
    Not only has it got access to the Starr Report, Clinton video, Ms Lewinsky's evidence etc,
    but it also points the way to many sites that might help relieve the feeling of stress and
    seriousness that such an important trial brings on. Y-Life lets surfers branch out to the
    I Love Monica Lewinsky page, Linda Tripp's official site, Create-a-Clinton Story, I Had
    Sex With Clinton, Too, the Right Wing Conspirator and a few other slightly off-centre
    sites.<br>
    <br>
    The ultimate distraction is offered at the <a href="http://www.realchange.org">Skeletons
    in the Closet</a> site where dirt is dumped on American politicians. It has its own
    version of the Lewinsky affair of course. But far better is the link to Severe Scandals.
    Here you can read about the politician who murdered his opponent or the one who sent an
    old mafia message by mailing dead fish. </strong></p>
