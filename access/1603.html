    Netizens </font></strong></h1>
    <p><strong>NUA Internet Surveys in Dublin estimates that more than 150 million people are
    connected to the Internet. Evidence suggests those people use the medium for about 150
    million different reasons.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>One thing that probably united thousands of Web surfers in a common use at the
    weekend, though, was the release of the second trailer to the much-anticipated new film,
    Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. The <a
    href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/trailer/">trailer</a> is available in the
    QuickTime video format and runs for two minutes 30 seconds. To download it, users have to
    be able to cope with a bandwidth-busting 20Mb-plus file.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>But the hour to two-hour equivalent of watching grass grow while the file
    downloads ends up revealing a fantastic little video, full of action and sci-fi adventure.
    It also reveals the power of cyber-marketing which the movie's makers, Lucas Films, has
    decided is the best use it can find for the medium.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The makers of South Park have also decided that Lucas Films' use of the Net is
    a good one. They have ridden in Star Wars' slipstream and made a funny spoof called Park
    Wars, which is a 14Mb file download and is available at the <a
    href="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/starwars/">Aarnet Australian mirror site</a> right in
    with the real Star Wars trailer.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The real Star Wars trailer was released on the Web the day before it was shown
    in US cinemas, another first for the medium. Lucas Films has hit on a formula that is
    bound to make the Phantom Menace one of the box office successes of the year when it is
    finally shown. Net users consistently make the original 1977 Star Wars film one of the
    most popular releases at the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/top_250_films">Internet Movie
    Database</a>. At the weekend it was number three behind the Shawshank Redemption and the
    Godfather, with an average score of 8.4 out of 10. But it had attracted by far the biggest
    number of voters; evidence for Lucas Films of potential massive drawing power.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The global newsgatherers at the Associated Press inadvertently found a new use
    for the Net last Friday. The General Electric communications satellite which AP uses to
    direct its news to thousands of customers spun out of control, briefly disrupting
    transmission. There was no news blackout in the 50 minutes that followed the spin-out
    though. Service to member newspapers and radio and TV stations was provided via the Web
    while the satellite problem was being fixed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Not everyone can find such great uses for the Net as Lucas Films and AP,
    however. Take the case of Germaine Greer. The author of the Female Eunuch and now Whole
    Woman was asked to write about her Net experiences by the Guardian newspaper in London to
    help promote its redesigned sites in January.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Instead of waxing lyrical about what a wonderful, helpful medium it was, Dr
    Greer had this to say:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;I have to be in favour of the Internet because I'm in favour of the free
    exchange of information, but 95 per cent of what is on it is wrong, three per cent is
    criminal and the other two per cent is useful, if of course you can find it.&quot;</strong></p>
