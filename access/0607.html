    <p><strong>THE Web has not taken long to lose its gloss. In less than two years the
    biggest up-front sites have opted to become ugly, text-filled pages that ape telephone
    directories.<br>
    <br>
    Go to <a href="http://www.bigpond.com">Telstra BigPond's home</a>, or <a
    href="http://www.excite.com.au">Excite Australia</a>, <a href="http://www.ninemsn.com.au">ninemsn</a>,
    certainly <a href="http://www.yahoo.com.au">Yahoo</a>. They all have that dull but worthy
    look. It is the look of the portal site. Depending on how you want to view things, portals
    are either the greatest form of mind control invented, or the handiest help at navigating
    the Web possible. On any given day I am prepared to accept either argument, as well as the
    many shades of grey in between. The Web is too diverse and explosive a medium to allow a
    fixed state of mind.<br>
    <br>
    For example, I could easily decry portal sites as a way for big companies -- such as
    Channel 9 and Microsoft through ninemsn -- to confine the entire surfing experience to
    sites run by them and their associates. Ninemsn will direct me to Microsoft Hotmail, Dolly
    magazine, and Channel 9 shows such as Sixty Minutes or the Footy Show. But no one dictates
    that I have to follow these navigation paths. If I was watching TV and did not like what
    was on Nine I would simply change channels. On the Web it is even easier plus there are
    millions of choices.<br>
    <br>
    Internet expert Jesse Berst of Ziff Davis Publishing recently raised the fear that portal
    sites were taking over home pages and thereby robbing users of their surfing freedom. He
    opened the subject up for feedback and was told, quite forcefully, by dozens of his
    readers that he was wrong.<br>
    <br>
    Even if portal home pages were trying to direct users down set paths that would result in
    commercial gain for the proprietors, users had a very easy way out -- they could simply
    change their home page. Quite right too. While arguments such as Berst's look plausible,
    they ignore one basic that the Internet is teaching us every day -- it is a medium where
    the user can reign.<br>
    <br>
    This point was hammered home last week at the Netmedia conference in London which featured
    an online media roundtable of European journalists, a cyberlaw lecture, a digital TV
    roundtable, and the presentation of the UK's first online journalism awards.<br>
    <br>
    The message from the conference was that the medium was controlled by its users.
    Traditional media had to learn from the Internet experience where &quot;people's
    journalism&quot; was becoming popular. As one speaker noted: &quot;We don't control our
    users, they'll go where they want, when they want, and it's now our job to take them
    there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Far from always being big, bad thought controllers, portal sites can even be helpful.
    Lately I have been experimenting with Excite Australia's version which allows a great deal
    of user customisation. At the click of the mouse I can read my horoscope, check the
    weather forecasts in nominated cities, display the top five news stories in four different
    categories, view my evening TV program guide, and have constantly updated displays of
    selected share prices.<br>
    <br>
    That's great, but a whiff of paranoia persists. Is Excite trying to make me happy so I
    will be easier to control?<br>
    <br>
    If it is, the remedy is simple -- build <a href="../index.html">my own home page</a> with
    basic HTML. Then I can foist it on others and control what they see . . . <br>
