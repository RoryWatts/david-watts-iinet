    <b><p>CNN carpet-bombed the world with its coverage of the 1991 Gulf war. It was as if
    death and destruction were spectator sports to be watched from the comfort of an armchair.</p>
    <p>The Internet adds a human dimension to massive coverage of the Iraq crisis, offering
    much more than officially-sanctioned views.</p>
    <p>That is not to say the traditional media outlets don't get a look-in. They have some of
    the best Web sites on the crisis. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1998/iraq/">CNN:
    Standoff with Iraq</a>, as you might expect, packs the latest developments along with a
    historical perspective. It offers surfers a discussion forum as well. Another US cable
    news organisation <a href="http://www.c-span.org/iraq.htm">C-SPAN</a> has coverage in
    RealVideo and Audio to complement a good array of links.</p>
    <p>The <a
    href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/iraq/newsid_54000/54261.stm">BBC</a>
    has an impressive page of up-to-the-minute reports and links. And our own <a
    href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/gulf/links.htm">ABC</a> offers similar treatment. Both
    have tried for a balanced approach, presenting Iraqi views as well as US, British and
    Australian ones.</p>
    <p>But the most mind-boggling set of resources comes, not surprisingly, from one of the
    true warriors of the Net. <a
    href="http://headlines.yahoo.com/Full_Coverage/World/Iraq_U_S_/">Yahoo</a> has several
    pages of links to major headlines, Web sites (possibly 100 or more) and discussion groups.</p>
    <p>For official political and diplomatic news and views, the <a
    href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/hot/iraq.html">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and
    Trade</a> site has an Australian perspective with a lot from the minister, Alexander
    Downer -- it is an official Government site after all.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> site is full of the latest press
    releases, plus full text of the resolutions that Iraq is in breach of.</p>
    <p>An official Iraqi view of the crisis is available at the <a
    href="http://www.undp.org/missions/iraq/">Permanent Mission of Iraq to UN</a>. It includes
    speeches by Saddam Hussein.</p>
    <p>Military buffs and those who just crave information should be fulfilled in their quest
    for knowledge about troop numbers, arsenals and chemical weapon types at both <a
    href="http://jdw.janes.com">Jane's Defence Weekly</a> and <a
    href="http://www.onestep.com/milnet/iraq.htm">MILNET</a> (Military Net).</p>
    <p>Good summaries of the politics, history and demographics of the Middle East are on show
    at <a href="http://www.arab.net/">Arab Net</a>.</p>
    <p>An interesting display of diverse views is available at <a
    href="http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/burke/iraq.html">The Differences Between US and Iraq</a>.
    Anti-war views and resources for peace activists are well presented at <a
    href="http://www.nonviolence.org/campaigns/iraq.htm">Iraq Crisis Anti-war Homepage</a>, a
    product of the Nonviolence Web organisation.</p>
    <p>Israelis claim they have the most to fear from Iraq's weapons, but that does not stop
    them having a bit of a wry look at the situation at the Virtual Jerusalem site where a <a
    href="http://www.virtual.co.il/city_services/news/specialreports/saddam/index.htm">Saddam-O-Meter</a>
    is in operation. </p>
    <p>Surfers let the site know how they feel -- the scale goes from &quot;complete
    calm&quot; to &quot;all-out panic&quot; -- and responses are mapped to a meter. The needle
    has been flickering at the panic end for a few weeks now.</p>
    <p>What looks like a very sensationalist view of the crisis, <a
    href="http://www.megastories.com/iraq/">Saddam's Republic of Fear</a> from Out There News,
    offers some excellent resources, including interactive military and political maps of the
    Gulf region.</p>
