    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#95B4EC"><h1><strong><font face="Arial">Expect the unexpected </font></strong></h1>
    <p><strong>ALWAYS expect the unexpected when surfing the Web. The other day I was finding
    addresses of reputable cricket statistics sites for a colleague.<br>
    <br>
    Okay, so we devotees of aggregates, averages and seagulls are probably in the
    trainspotting class of trivia buffs, but the Web serves us well. I had landed at the <a
    href="http://www.interprop.com.au/baggygreen/">Baggy Green Cap</a> site that promises
    statistics for every one who has played for Australia. And a jolly good site it is too.<br>
    <br>
    To check similar sites, I pushed the What's Related button on my Netscape browser. This
    function searches Netscape's archives for pages which deal with a subject similar to the
    one displayed on your screen. It is a fast way to establish links . . . maybe.<br>
    <br>
    The results presented said more about a love of trivia than a love of cricket. There was a
    mention of <a href="http://www-aus.cricket.org">CricInfo</a>, the cricket lover's Bible on
    the Web, and World Cup cricket records. But there were also some fascinating titles that
    just had to be followed . . . and forget the task at hand.<br>
    <br>
    One was to a page that asked the surfer to submit a lie. On further investigation, this
    forked back to the main page of a site called <a
    href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hancockd/dwol.htm">Dave's Web of Lies</a>, which was of
    course far more interesting than doing real work.<br>
    <br>
    The Web of Lies allows users to subscribe via e-mail to a Lie of the Day list. Recipients
    are guaranteed that nothing they read will be true. The creators of the site, disturbed at
    the amount of out-of-date information, popular misconceptions, and mistruths presented as
    fact on the Web, have vowed &quot;to trawl the world's information nets seeking out
    falsehoods&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    They then promise to e-mail subscribers or present on their site &quot;the latest
    lies&quot; so that surfers can be assured what they read is definitely untrue.<br>
    <br>
    Last Sunday's lie of the day, for example, was: Cinnamon is imported from another planet.
    Well that is a pretty obvious lie. But other features at the site can leave you scratching
    your head.<br>
    <br>
    This week's celebrity liar was comedian Stephen Fry -- and who are we to doubt the truth
    that Fry actually wrote the section? Among his gems:<br>
    * Welshmen are allergic to pyjamas.<br>
    * William Shakespeare's middle name was Colin.<br>
    * Belgian males remove their trousers while driving.<br>
    <br>
    The site also has a guest liar, who as far as one can tell is simply a Web surfer who has
    submitted a good set of lies. You never know, though, it could easily be Stephen Fry
    again.<br>
    <br>
    One other site, presented by Netscape as being related to cricket statistics -- what a lie
    -- was called <a href="http://members.aol.com/JuliannaA/4-triv.html">Trivial Facts About
    Famous People.</a> For all I know it could be as full of untruths as the Web of Lies, but
    among its offerings were these:<br>
    * Mel Blanc -- the voice of Bugs Bunny -- was allergic to carrots. <br>
    * Jimmy Carter was the first US president to have been born in a hospital.<br>
    * Winston Churchill was a skilled bricklayer and for many years carried a union card.<br>
    * Charles Dickens always faced north when writing and sleeping.<br>
    * Luciano Pavarotti carries a bent nail in his pocket for good luck whenever he sings.<br>
    <br>
    There is much, much more. It left me with the impression you can certainly learn something
    new every day . . . whether you believe it is a different matter entirely. </strong></p>
