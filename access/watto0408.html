    <td valign="top" width="450"><strong>IF YOU want to be politically correct, a lot of
    material on the Internet is beyond the threshhold of belief. It would be unparliamentary
    to say there were lies and unprincipled liars peddling them in cyberspace. But that is the
    sad truth.</strong><p><strong>If you connected only recently chances are you have received
    your first virus alert email already. I receive a lot of worried correspondence from new
    users, asking whether the warning they have received not to touch email on penalty of a
    hard drive crash, could possibly be true.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In 99 per cent of the cases, the unfortunate newbies have been the subject of a
    hoax. The latest warning going around tells of dire consequences if you download a
    screensaver called Budsaver. &quot;If you download this file someone from the internet
    will get your screen name and password,&quot; says the virus alert.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Maybe, maybe not. It seems unlikely. But in any case, no one should open an
    email attachment containing a program sent by someone they do not know. It is not the
    email that will contaminate their computer, it is the attached program. When in doubt,
    delete the message. Even if you know the sender, run a virus-checking program.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Hoax virus alerts seem to be some ritual initiation ceremony for Net users.
    That is not to say that anyone can be complacent once they've gained some experience on
    the super highway, however. In the past fortnight both Microsoft and Netscape have
    revealed that some of their email packages are in danger of contamination from malicious
    users who send extremely long filenames (more than 200 characters).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The program bug can be exploited on the Communicator Messenger package from
    Netscape and both Outlook Express and Outlook98 from Microsoft. <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/default.asp">Microsoft has posted a patch</a> to
    try to fix the loophole.<br>
    But email contamination is rare. An excellent resource for checking hoaxes and a humorous
    history of their life on the Net can be found at the <a
    href="http://www.nonprofit.net/hoax/hoax.html">Don't Spread that Hoax</a> site.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>More malicious than hoax email are the thousands of pages of blatantly
    unreliable information dressed up at respectable-looking Web sites. Veteran US
    correspondent Pierre Salinger caused a sensation last year when he announced that he had
    discovered documents on the Internet proving that TWA's flight 770 to Paris (which
    exploded minutes after taking off from New York) was the victim of friendly fire from a US
    missile test. The document was an Internet forgery.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Much of the earlier reporting on President Clinton's alleged affair with Monica
    Lewinsky was driven by a cyclone of gossip on the Web. The notorious online
    &quot;journalist&quot; Matt Drudge has become a celebrity for presenting the unreliable to
    a growing gullible audience at his Drudge Report site.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Millennium Bug is causing barely controlled hysteria, which in a great deal
    of cases, particularly for home users, is unwarranted. One Web creator called Uncle Dave
    is dispensing outrageous advice at his <a href="http://www.survival-center.com">Survival
    Center</a>, including warning Net users to move to the country with full emergency
    supplies at the turn of the century. He also calls on the National Guard to be on full
    alert and for all heavy machinery to be shut down.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Medical hoaxes are everywhere too. Chances are you have heard of the boy with
    cancer who needs postcards and email from around the world.<br>
    He doesn't. As many of these medi-hoaxes as possible are exposed at an excellent site
    called <a href="http://www.quackwatch.com">Quackwatch</a>.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The big problem is the sheer quantity of information. The thousands of hits
    produced by search engines offer an illusion of authority which is undeserved. Tools to
    sift out the good information are crude at best. The product of these searches is
    frequently an almost random selection of references that often do not include the sources
    that really matter.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The people who take advantage of this are liars, conspiracy theorists,
    political extremists, financial con-men and pornographers.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>More than the real world, the message to the average Internet user has to be
    Buyer Beware. And you just have to believe it. </strong></td>
