    wars: who cares?</font></strong></h1>
    <p><strong>WHO is winning the browser war between Microsoft and Netscape? Does anyone
    really care?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The hype surrounding this battle stepped up again last week when Microsoft
    unleashed the public beta of <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie5/?/windows/ie/ie5/main.htm">Internet Explorer
    5.0</a>, just two weeks after Netscape unveiled the official version 4.5 of <a
    href="http://www.netscape.com.au">Communicator</a>. Both are very good, with MSIE, despite
    being only a beta, points ahead in speed and reliability. Great for the software
    companies, but what of we users?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Computer industry analysts at the likes of ZDNet, c|net, Wired and PC World say
    that most people use the browser that either came with their computer or with their
    provider's software when they connected to the Net. They are reluctant to download and
    install newer versions either because they are not sure how to, or they are not convinced
    a newer version will improve their Web experiences.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Yet the impression given by sites like <a href="http://www.browserwatch.com">Browserwatch</a>,
    which try to measure the browser market, is that the majority of users have newer browsers
    like MSIE 4.0 and Netscape Communicator 4.0. Last week Browserwatch had 50.7 per cent of
    its visits from people using Netscape and 36.5 per cent by MSIE users.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Overall, 15 per cent were using Netscape 4.0 or better on Windows 95, 9 per
    cent version 4.0 on Windows NT, 6 per cent version 4.0 on Windows 98, the same for Macs;
    with just 2.2 per cent using Netscape 3.0. Neglible numbers were using Netscape 2.0 or
    lower. Nine per cent of visitors had MSIE 4.0 or better on Win 98, 7 per cent on Win 95
    and 6 per cent on NT. Only 2.6 per cent used MSIE 3.0. A handful had older versions.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>These figures could indicate one of two things:<br>
    a) Visitors to Browserwatch are committed browser users and knowledgable about software
    and thus more likely to upgrade to newer versions; b) The site reflects the rapidly
    expanding nature of the medium with newer users armed with newer computers -- and
    therefore newer browsers -- accounting for the hits.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What the statistics do not reveal is what users want from their browsers, or
    whether they are interested in upgrading every few months. The rush by the companies to
    change versions several times a year -- that includes public betas -- has done nothing to
    define a simple standard of accessibility on the Web. Older browsers simply will not read
    sites created with the types of toys that newer browsers make possible.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The <a href="../indexa.html">JavaScript trial page</a> I started building last
    week worked beautifully in MSIE 4.0, then 5.0. MSIE 3.0, however, would not have a bar of
    it. Only half of it worked in Netscape's latest 4.5. Opera did not want to know about it.
    So many permutations for just one page.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Somebody is making a lot of work for Web page authors, and the buck stops at
    the doorsteps of MS and Netscape as they battle to out-do each other. A global medium
    should have global standards.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I have compiled a short survey to try to find out some browser facts among
    readers. You can e-mail <a href="mailto:watto@iinet.net.au">watto@iinet.net.au</a> with
    replies to the following:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* Which Web browser do you use regularly?<br>
    * Do you use another? If so, which one?<br>
    * Have you upgraded a browser? <br>
    * If so, did you download it from the Net?<br>
    * Was your present browser already on your computer when you bought it?<br>
    * Was your browser supplied with your Internet Service Provider's software?<br>
