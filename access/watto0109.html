    no doubt evidence of a conspiracy to make users stay connected longer so that they lose
    touch with real life and become easy prey for mind control.</strong><p><strong>Precious
    gems of the human imagination are running wild out there in cyberspace. Take these two
    postings last weekend from the alt.conspiracy newsgroup:</strong><ul>
      <li><strong> &quot;The powers that be are orchestrating a world wide depression. The goal is
        to bring back slavery.&quot;</strong></li>
      <li><strong> &quot;The entire Clinton sex scandal was a distraction, and did it work good.
        Just as good as the OJ trials. The Clinton apology was even more of a distraction. It was
        meant to distract the media from real actions by OA (Omega Agency, a New World Order group
        who controls Clinton like a puppet) while they set up for their attempt at take-over in
        2000.&quot;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>It is hard to get away from an American view of life because of the weight of
    domination of US users. But just by typing the words &quot;Harold Holt&quot; in the window
    of the Australian <a href="http://www.anzwers.com.au">Anzwers</a> search engine, it is
    possible to get a local conspiracy feel.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>About 1500 results are returned, but it is number 13 before you find a site
    that is not a spoof or conspiracy-related. The 20th match is a highly informative fact
    sheet about the former Liberal prime minister who drowned off Portsea, Victoria, while
    skindiving in December 1967.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Or did he . . . ? Before the factual site, the results are dominated by
    articles from a Queensland alternative paper called <a href="http://www.thebug.com.au">The
    Bug</a> that appears to delight in taking the micky. Under the headline &quot;Grisly find
    debunks 'Holt did a bolt' theory&quot;, The Bug &quot;reports&quot; that:<br>
    &quot;The discovery in Cambodia of the remains of former Australian prime minister Harold
    Holt would finally lay to rest the disgraceful rumours that the Liberal leader had fled
    the country willingly, committed suicide or drowned, Australia's foremost political
    analyst said this week.&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This, by the way, is the number one result returned by Anzwers. Further down is
    a more serious attempt at discussing the alleged Holt conspiracy by <a
    href="http://sunday.ninemsn.com.au/inv_sleuth7.htm">Channel 9's Sunday show</a>. Sunday
    uses the Web to showcase its television show and has its more sober Holt story in a
    section called Sleuth's Corner which invites Netizens to e-mail their opinions.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This morning (WA time), hundreds or perhaps thousands of people around the
    world were involved in a global two-hour chat session discussing the conspiracy theories
    behind the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, a year ago yesterday. Cyber-talk of
    conspiracies about Diana started within two or three hours of her death.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The chat session today was touted as an attempt to draw out some expert and
    hopefully sceptical discussion. The chat has been organised by the <a
    href="http://www.internet-inquirer.com">Conspiracy Theory Discussion Board</a> which uses
    its Web site to pose the many conspiracy theories behind Diana's death. It also links to
    16 sites around the world dedicated to the Diana conspiracy.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And, as they say in the ads, there's more. There are links to <a
    href="http://www.internet-inquirer.com./princess-diana-conspiracy3.htm">20 sites which
    deal entirely with conspiracy theories</a>. They bear titles such as: The Disinformation
    Site; 50 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time Site; Conspiracy Encyclopedia; The Smoking Gun,
    and JFK: The Mother of All Conspiracy Theories.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>It is possible from at least some of these sites to end up in the bilge of
    pro-nazi, anti-semite, racist articles of the Hatewatch site, surely the lowest form of
    cyber-life with its ridiculous conspiracies. But back to the Diana chat. The Conspiracy
    Theory Discussion Board believes her death to be the crime of the century. It claims many
    of the thousands of people who have discussed the death in the past year are
    &quot;typically not individuals who are conspiracy-minded&quot;. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Among their number are said to be doctors from Australia and Denmark who have
    debunked some of the medical reports concerning Princess Diana and Henri Paul; a Nascar
    engineer who explains in technical terms how the Mercedes may have been rigged, and a
    political consultant with experience in public figure safety threats.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This is fertile ground if you are so inclined. </strong></p>
