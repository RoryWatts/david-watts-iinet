    <td><font face="Arial">HOMER SIMPSON receives the dubious achievement award -- again --
    for this line in the Simpsons on Channel 10 last week: &quot;Wow, they've got the Internet
    on computers now.&quot;</font><p><font face="Arial">As we know, Homer is not a bright
    bloke, but perhaps he would be more amazed to know that &quot;they&quot; even have live
    birth on the Internet now.<br>
    Last Tuesday <a href="http://www.ahn.com/livebirth/index.htm"><strong>America's Health
    Network</strong></a> allowed people with RealPlayer to watch a 40-year-old woman give
    birth to baby Sean. The video footage is archived at the site for those who missed it,
    which turned out to be millions because of the line congestion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">At least 30,000 people, almost all from the eastern US, tried to log
    on within the first hour of broadcast but the system would accept only 3000 from the East
    at a time, said J. Tod Fetherling, president of America's Health Network-Interactive. The
    system was set up so about 10,000 people nationwide could watch at one time. Even
    America's Health Network's own technicians had trouble calling up the broadcast in a media
    room at the hospital.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">For those who have seen a live birth, it remains a magical moment.
    For those who have not it is indeed a miracle. But birth on the screen is hardly something
    new. Those who were around in 1968 might remember the first global TV satellite hook-up
    during which different countries contributed small segments of live action to be seen by
    the first truly mass audience. Australia showed a tram leaving a depot in Melbourne.
    Mexico showed a live birth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Sitting and watching -- particularly at a 28.8K RealPlayer broadcast
    that looks like stop-gap animation -- is a passive activity even where a miraculous event
    like birth is concerned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">While baby Sean's welcome to the world captured headlines last week,
    the real interactive nature of the Web bubbled along pretty much as always, satisfying
    millions in the process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">For example, those who were a little surprised or even shocked by
    the One Nation Party's assault on the hearts and minds of Queenslanders at the State
    election were able to read all about Pauline Hanson's policies at the official <a
    href="http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/qldstate/june13/"><strong>One Nation</strong></a>
    page. If they disagreed they could click on the <a
    href="http://www.protest.org/ournat.htm"><strong>Our Nation</strong></a> petition against
    ONP and whiz off a protest e-mail. If still in doubt they could have checked talkback
    radio's <a href="http://www.sattler.com.au/main/archive/"><strong>Howard Sattler Archives</strong></a>
    to see the arguments for and against. While at it they could have participated at his
    Opinion page which allows you to vote on a topic of the day . . . and as many times as you
    like.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Or, with a looming Federal election in mind, you could have seen
    Health Minister <a href="http://www.wooldridge.aust.com"><strong>Michael Wooldridge</strong></a>
    make his debut on the Web with his campaign site, believed to be the first by an
    Australian minister of State.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">If you veered away from politics, <a
    href="http://survey.hotlink.com.au"><strong>www.consult</strong></a> had a terrific survey
    to fill in. It comprises 78 questions about Net use habits and dwells heavily on online
    shopping and banking, which are obviously growing trends. At the <a
    href="http://www.surelink.com.au"><strong>Telstra Surelink</strong></a> page you could see
    just how the Web might become the ideal shopping mall. Assured of secure transactions with
    credit cards you can browse and order goodies including books from Angus &amp; Robertson,
    CDs, software, hardware, flowers and fashion. You might even like to pay your phone bill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">And that amount of interactivity is only the tip of a huge iceberg
    that has the potential to sink the growth of couch potatoism.<br>
