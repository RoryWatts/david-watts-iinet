        <td valign="top" width="450"><strong>THE Australian political cyberscape&nbsp; is a pretty
        dry place.</strong><p><strong>We might have had an interesting federal election just 17
        days ago, but traces of wild debate on the World Wide Web are hard to find. Both major
        combatants, the Liberal and Labor parties, have left their election sites exactly as they
        were on polling day, October 3.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The <a href="http://www.liberal.org.au/">Liberals' official party page</a> --
        as distinct from its <a href="http://www.liberal.org.au/election98/">election page</a> --
        has not changed a jot. It still operates as a place where Net users can find out about the
        party and join it if they wish. <a href="http://www.alp.org.au">Labor's home</a> is under
        construction for a relaunch, possibly incorporating the java and latest technology that
        made<a href="http://www.alp.org.au/campaign/index.html"> its election page</a> the
        snazziest -- visually -- during the campaign. The <a
        href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~npafed/">National Party</a> and the <a
        href="http://www.democrats.org.au/">Democrats</a> continue to use the Web as a
        supplementary information tool.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>And Pauline Hanson's <a href="http://www.gwb.com.au/onenation/federal/">One
        Nation</a> page has come to a virtual halt with the addition of only one press release
        since the party's figurehead was dumped by the people of Blair.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Web does not appear to be a major political weapon in this country. It is
        doubtful we will ever see its use for the mass release of a damming political document
        like the Starr report on Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky in the US, for
        example. Nor are we likely to hear of high-profile hackings such as the one carried out on
        the Indian Army's Kashmir pages last week.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Kashmir pages which log -- from an official Indian point of view -- actions
        against Pakistani insurgents in the region, were replaced by reports of the alleged
        torture of Kashmiris by the Indian security forces. The sabotage happened as India and
        Pakistan began talks in Islamabad to ease tensions. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>We in Australia did see a political hacking during the election campaign. Two
        young ALP staff members lost their jobs for encouraging the hacking of the Liberal site.
        But the alterations were undergraduate in comparison to the Kashmir episode. The Liberals'
        pages were altered to link to pornography sites, or biographies were changed with the
        inclusion of misleading words. Hardly international incident stuff. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>The &quot;highlight&quot; of the Web's contribution to political debate during
        the campaign was fairly undergraduate too.&nbsp; Labor included two games -- one that
        could be played online and the other that could be downloaded -- as part of its
        interactive package. Both games are still available at the campaign site. The online one
        is called Creamfields. Users are invited to try to hit Prime Minister John Howard with as
        many cream pies as possible. The other is Howard's End in which users have to hit various
        targets -- one is a Telstra for sale sign -- that pop up around a cartoon figure of Mr
        Howard.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>While this indicates a lack of high drama in the relationship between the Net
        and politics, it also points to a lack of intervention in the Net by politicians. But what
        might the future hold? It is all fairly quiet and undramatic now, but the Net will
        certainly become more a household necessity than a luxury in the next few years.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Net campaigners <a href="http://www.efa.org.au">Electronic Frontiers Australia</a>
        recently analysed the major parties' policies towards the medium. The Liberal-National
        coalition and One Nation fared worst in the EFA's estimation, scoring only half the
        ratings the free-speech advocates gave to Labor, the Democrats and the Greens.&nbsp; EFA
        board member Danny Yee described coalition policy on offensive and pornographic material
        as &quot;not only impractical, but also wildly overbroad and highly illiberal. John Stuart
        Mill will be turning in his grave.&quot;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Yee also commented that none of the parties had taken a bold stance in
        support of online liberties. &quot;EFA is convinced that this will be an increasingly
        important issue. Trampling on the freedoms of Australians in order to appear tough on porn
        or to curry favour with the United States defence establishment will not be a
        vote-winner,&quot; Mr Yee said.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Do we take note and go on alert, or sit back and watch Mark Taylor? For the
        time-being, a bit of both would not hurt. </strong></p>
