    <p><strong>ON THE last day of 1998 I was hard at work at the interface, doing the usual
    things . . . deleting spam, yawning at flame wars between students who cannot spell,
    finding yet another new portal site acting as a shopfront . . . and so on.<br>
    <br>
    Then, as Banjo Paterson would say, an answer (to my tedium) came directed in a writing
    unexpected. Not quite, but a package containing a CD with the <a
    href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat Linux</a> operating system and the <a
    href="http://apcmag.com/shop/">Pocketbook</a> manual, ordered online three weeks earlier,
    was certainly a tonic.<br>
    <br>
    As I have been technology-free on Rottnest for the past week, I have not installed Linux
    to sit side-by-side with Windows yet. But I have had time to RTFM, as they say on the Net
    (that is Read the Flippin' Manual, or something similar, for the uninitiated).<br>
    <br>
    I am both fascinated and a little scared. Linux's exacting commands are a challenge. It is
    said the OS is user-friendly, but it is very choosy about its friends. However, it appears
    to promise a return to the days when users were put in control of their computers rather
    than vice-versa.<br>
    <br>
    It also appears to promise fewer crashes -- one user is on record as reporting more than
    320 trouble-free days of non-stop operation -- and a bit more speed with optimum use of
    the hardware.<br>
    <br>
    The biggest plus is that it is considerably cheaper than the $159 that a Windows upgrade
    will cost. In fact it is free. Users pay for documentation and shipping, not for the
    operating system.<br>
    <br>
    Linux is free because it was developed collectively across the Net by skilled programmers
    working in the open source tradition which holds that software should be freely accessible
    to the community.<br>
    <br>
    Experienced computer users know all this already. Linux has been developed co-operatively
    since its invention in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. A lot of newer users may not be aware of
    it, however. And companies like Microsoft, which control so much of what a typical new
    user does, would not mind if it stayed that way.<br>
    <br>
    Linux -- enjoying a surge in popularity because of its endorsement by Netscape last
    January -- rose to even more prominence in November when a memo by a Microsoft engineer
    was leaked on the Net.<br>
    <br>
    The so-called <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html">Halloween Documents</a>
    explain to Microsoft bosses the threat posed by a free Linux and the open source software
    development community that built it. Linux threatens Microsoft's ambitions for the
    much-postponed new NT system, now renamed Windows 2000.<br>
    <br>
    Interest in Linux is increasing steadily. Salon magazine claims more than five million
    people have it installed. An International Data Corporation analyst also told Salon that
    between 2 million and 6 million copies of Linux were installed in 1997 alone (compared
    with 3.8 million new installations of the Macintosh OS in 1997).<br>
    <br>
    Microsoft is probably not quaking in its boots . . . yet. And at the moment, Linux is not
    for the faint-hearted. You need to know DOS and understand directory structures at least.
    Its strength still is in running network servers under the guidance of computer-savvy
    staff.<br>
    <br>
    But at the rate the co-operative nature of the Net works, an attractive, reliable -- and
    very cheap -- operating system with an easy-to-use shell is sure to emerge soon for home
    users. </strong></p>
