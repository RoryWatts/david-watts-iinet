    <td valign="top" width="450"><font face="Arial">NORMALLY I will champion the Internet as
    the most marvellous medium of our age. Sometimes I wonder why I bother.</font><p><font
    face="Arial">In the past week the Net has been the focus of the most tawdry scenes. An
    American, calling himself Oscar Wells, announced he had a Web site on which two
    18-year-old Californians -- honours students and pillars of the church -- would lose their
    virginity to each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The couple, Mike and Diane, were pictured on the Web with black
    masking their faces. They showed two gorgeously healthy bodies, however, which made one
    cynical to say the least. Mike and Diane had the bodies of actors or models.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Investigations by <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com">Salon
    Magazine</a> revealed that people behind Oscar Wells's site -- called Our First Time --
    had connections to movie-making sites, mostly of a dubious nature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Further investigations by the Washington Post alleged that Oscar
    Wells was a pseudonym for Ken Tipton, an actor and aspiring filmmaker. The Oscar Wells tag
    stemmed from Orson Wells, the legendary actor-writer who 60 years ago just happened to
    perpetrate the massive &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; hoax.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The Post also reported that the IEG organisation which had taken
    over the running of Our First Time had withdrawn from the whole Mike and Diane show when
    the site's designer said he planned to renege on his promise not to charge for access and
    institute a $5 fee on August 4 -- the designated date for Mike and Diane's very public
    first love.<br>
    IEG alleged the couple said they would not have sex on the Web, deciding that they weren't
    ready to take that step. IEG, by the way, is home to dozens of hard and softcore porn
    sites, and lists the Pamela Anderson-Tommy Lee video as one of its triumphs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">All in all a desperate charade which had millions crashing Our First
    Time, and countless others wondering what good such a public display of a very private
    moment could bring. </font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">If claims that the love-making was to be tastefully
    presented, then it was little more than soft porn being promoted.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">If claims that the love-making would be good sex education
    for adolescents, why choose the possible fumblings and embarrassments of two virgins to
    show?</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The questions go on, but foremost is the concern that such public
    stupidity is so easy to promote on the Net. Its near-anarchical freedom can be such a good
    weapon for openness and free speech. And such a bludgeon in the hands of people like Mike,
    Diane and Oscar Wells.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">It is refreshing to remember that all such popular media have messy
    beginnings. Indeed, it was on the very modern medium of the Web that I was reading Thomas
    Mallory's <a href="http://www.celtic-twilight.com/malory/lemorte_menu.htm">Morte D'Arthur</a>
    the day after Channel 9's Merlin mini-series, when I stumbled on the news that William
    Caxton -- who printed the first edition -- was a messy and disorganised publisher who
    liked to meddle with the works he printed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Thus he played around with some of Mallory's text and even had
    chapters beginning in the middle of sentences. Caxton was a pioneer. Without him, English
    literature would not have become public as early as it did. Books would have remained much
    longer in the domain of the privileged few. The Dark Ages would have been darker.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Maybe we can forgive Mike and Diane their cyber-fumblings in the
    name of progress.</font></p>
