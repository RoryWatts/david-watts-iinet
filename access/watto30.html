    <td><font face="Arial">IT'S ALL too much. The pace of the new technological world has
    finally caught up.</font><p><font face="Arial">Last week I subscribed to <strong><a
    href="http://www.foxtel.com.au">Foxtel</a></strong> (cable TV for non-Australians), thus
    adding pay-TV on one set to normal TV on two others, Nintendo64 on one of them, the
    Internet on the PC and goodness knows how many CD players, digital alarm-clock-radios,
    microwaves and VCRs . . . all with different time settings and personalities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Foxtel tipped the scale from disorganised chaos to the anarchy of
    information overload.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Take last Thursday for example . . . please. I connected to the Net,
    read 27 e-mails (three abusive, two trying to sell me something), read the Age, the
    Guardian, the Times, checked Reuters, the ABC, BBC and CNN (all available at <strong><a
    href="http://www.iinet.net.au/~watto/index1.html">my news index</a></strong>); then,
    because of Foxtel, searched the channels until I found when Bonanza was on and asked the
    network to send me an e-mail reminder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">A quick check of my Microsoft Outlook calendar revealed I had missed
    an important meeting. But not to worry I faxed, then e-mailed the possibly disappointed
    other party. Obligation fulfilled, I cruised the Foxtel channels on TV, all 28 of them,
    and spent an average of one minute on each. This figure was distorted because I watched Dr
    Who for 10 minutes, trying to work out whether Sylvester McCoy was a better time lord than
    Tom Baker, William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton or even John Pertwee.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Case unresolved, I cruised to watch some live <strong><a
    href="http://www.wimbledon.org">Wimbledon</a></strong>, then realised that Fox Sports was
    showing only one match and I had no idea how anyone but Carlos Moya was doing. Back to the
    Net and the Wimbledon site for constantly updated scores. A few more e-mails, read the
    Washington Post and an article by Bill Gates in the <strong><a
    href="http://www.economist.com">Economist</a></strong>, basically saying no one has the
    right to interfere with Microsoft's plans for world domination.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Maybe it wasn't about that, but the exact recollection was erased
    when I tapped into the <strong><a href="news:microsoft.public.win98.pre-release">Windows98
    newsgroup</a></strong> and found that someone had sent a list of 25 Web links at which one
    could find news of Win98's release that day.<br>
    Considering it was not even breakfast time in the US, I had the feeling the list was about
    to grow to Godzilla-like proportions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">So to shrug off this growing technolurgy -- a word I found in the
    Sydney Morning Herald's <strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/icon/">Icon</a></strong>
    site -- I rugged up with a familiar, old book, Flying Visits by Clive James. This is a
    collection of his postcards from around the world written in the 70s and 80s for the
    Observer newspaper.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Jolly good too, particularly where he describes flying to LA and
    watching an in-flight movie of Maggie Smith flying to LA for the Oscars in which she is
    watching an in-flight movie about an actress flying to LA for the Oscars.<br>
    Not surprised that that gave James a dose of technolurgy, I put down the book and hopped
    on the Net to see what impact the urbane and literate Australian ex-pat had made on this
    wonderful new medium.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Searches at four different engines revealed hardly any at all. Just
    a TV guide talking about an interview he had with Mel Gibson and an amazingly illiterate <strong><a
    href="http://www.geocities.com/Wellesley/1057/rev20falling.html">review by a fan</a></strong>
    of his book Falling Towards England. Really, these are some of the reviewer's descriptions
    of James: &quot;(he uses) rather alaborate, multisyllabled prose&quot;, &quot;Australian
    expatriot&quot;, &quot;Clive James, the larrican latestarter&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">What the Net has given in the ability to communicate, it would
    appear to have taken in the method of communicating . . . good, grammatical English.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Confounded by the Net, TV and books, I went outside for a blast of
    fresh air.<br>
    But it was midnight. The day had gone and I had achieved nothing.<br>
    Oh, I did get time to write this rubbish . . . now for Bonanza.<br>
