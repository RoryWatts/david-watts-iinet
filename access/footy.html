    <small>By David Watts</small></font></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">You can never have too much footy.&nbsp; And the World Wide
    Web feeds us to bursting point. This is a good thing too. It means we can go from the
    feast of cricket sites to the banquet of Australian Rules ones without skipping a meal.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial"> It only seems like yesterday -- indeed it almost was -- that
    *<a href="http://www-aus.cricket.org">CricInfo</a>* was collecting all my hits. It had
    ball-by-ball coverage one weekend of the second Test between Australia and India, the
    Sheffield Shield final between WA and Tasmania, the final England-West Indies Test,
    Pakistan v Zimbabwe and South Africa against Sri Lanka.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial"> But as the AFL season proper bounced off, CricInfo, and the
    bad vibes sent out as wristy Indian batsmen hammered our &quot;world champions&quot;, was
    deserted in favour of a new -- and hopefully sweeter -- ball game.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">First stop for any footy follower should be the official *<a
    href="http://www.afl.com.au">AFL page</a>*. Last year's ponderous site has been revamped
    hugely now that the AFL has hopped into bed with Channel 7 and News Limited as Net
    partners.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Someone has done their homework because the site is fast, has
    lots of up-to-date news -- rather than official league press releases -- and video footage
    of the highlights of every round in 1997 (this will be added to as this season fires up).
    It also offers free membership with the promise of e-mail news and results tailored to
    your choice of club.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">A further highlight are the live scoreboards on match days
    which not only offer constant score updates, but access to all the team and individual
    stats as well.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">You don't have to tie yourself down to official sites to
    appreciate the inroads footy has made into the Web, however. The *<a
    href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~statware/statlink.html">Footy Links</a>* page promises
    274 sites on tap. This collection of official and unofficial pages was called 160 Footy
    Links only a year ago.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial"> The growing number of Web-savvy fans who have created HTML
    shrines to their clubs and heroes might find the *<a
    href="http://www.eisa.net.au/~ogrady/AFLRing/index.html">AFL Web Ring Homepage</a>* the
    perfect place to hawk their talents. Membership of the ring allows the author to place his
    or her site among a growing army of AFL-related ones -- 90 at last count. Each site
    carries a Web Ring link, which allows surfers to visit either the next site in the ring,
    skip five sites to the next one, or to call for a random site.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial"> The *<a
    href="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=afl;list">list of AFL Web Ring sites</a>*
    reveals there is a great variety of choice. You might fancy Port Adelaide, so there is
    Adrian's Port Power Page to visit; or you might have a fascination for the Osborne Park
    Junior Football Club . . . it's there too. Then again you might be a very traditional
    North Melbourne supporter and opt for the Shinboners' Hall of Fame.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial"> If you are so inclined, you can even enter online tipping
    competitions. One set up less than a fortnight ago is run by the Statewest Credit Society
    in WA and is called *<a href="http://www.statewest.com">Fingertip Footy</a>*. It is a
    sophisticated site that obviously wants to draw attention to its creators and find new
    society members, but does not go for the hard sell, thus allowing tipsters to indulge in
    some free fun.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Other free tipping contests like *<a
    href="http://www.footy.com.au/tipping/">The Big Tip</a>* and *<a
    href="http://www.sofcom.com.au/myfooty/">My Footy</a>* are not hard to find. And if you
    just want to whinge about the umpiring or vent your frustrations about the coaching, check
    out the newsgroup *<a href="news:rec.sport.football.australian">rec.sport.football.australian</a>*.
    It's just like a pub after the game -- only drier.</font></small></p>
