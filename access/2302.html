    village </font></strong></h1>
    <p><strong>MEDIA guru Marshall McLuhan had people frowning and scratching their heads in
    1967 when he wrote of the global village. This was a place, he said, &quot;created by
    instant electronic information movement. (It) is at once as wide as the planet and as
    small as the little town&quot;.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>What on earth did he mean? Thirty years down the track it is obvious that the
    Internet fits his description that originally stemmed from the increased use of
    telephones, radio and television. Indeed the Y-Life site on the Web has taken the analogy
    another step or two in a feature called the <a
    href="http://www.zdnet.com/yil/content/mag/9901/webville.html">Road to Webville</a>,<br>
    <br>
    It describes cosy communities of students, software developers, shoppers and the like
    beavering away with e-mail and Web sites that link common causes regardless of geography.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Microsoft boss Bill Gates is often quoted as saying the Net is in its very
    early stages; more like an old wild west or frontier town than a sophisticated city. Maybe
    it was when Mr Gates finally decided to squat there several years after the pioneers laid
    the foundations. But now some familiar names from what we may call the real -- or
    non-cyber --world are settling in, and buying up the neighbourhoods.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Names like Packer and Murdoch. Kerry Packer's Publishing &amp; Broadcasting and
    Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation last week decided to inject up to $709 million into
    telephone reseller <a href="http://www.onetel.com.au">One.Tel</a> over the next three
    years. The money will be mainly used to finance One.Tel's marketing efforts on its mobile
    phone, long distance and Net services.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>It gives both companies even more leverage in Australia's increasingly
    important communications industry. Packer and Murdoch companies control much of our TV,
    newspaper and magazine markets already. They began spreading their Web wings seriously
    last year.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A stake in One.Tel reinforces their liking for the Net as a money-maker next
    millennium. One.Tel's emblem, a cartoon surfie known as the Dude, was very much at home
    when the global village was just that, a village. But the suit-wearing, corporate style
    personified by Lachlan Murdoch and James Packer, who brokered the deal for their fathers'
    companies, is bound to catch on as the village grows.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And do not be surprised if village life is soon influenced by a virtual
    stranger, albeit one with a familiar name. James Murdoch, at 26 the youngest of Rupert's
    clan is charged with lifting News Corp's Net presence, seen by some online critics as
    lagging behind other media giants like Time-Pathfinder and the Bertelsmann empire.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And why are the new faces appearing in the global village; a town whose early
    inhabitants moved there to get away from corporate influence and consumerism? An answer
    might be found in <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/">Fortune</a> magazine which
    said last week:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;Global competition and the ever-increasing pressure for productivity
    gains have made new technology investment an absolute necessity for most businesses, not a
    luxury reserved for good times. The growth potential of the companies leading this
    revolution dwarfs that of old-line blue chips.&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The bottom line is that by the end of 2000 there are expected to be 300 million
    people in the global village. And the bulk of them will be well-educated and affluent
    enough to help push new barriers . . . or spend money, whichever comes first.</strong><br>
