    <td valign="top" width="450"><strong>UNLESS you have been on Mars you will know that
    Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is making all the noise in Australian politics.</strong><p><strong>Arguments
    about whether the party's policies are racist and divisive appear to shed more heat than
    light, but they are everywhere. If you doubt the impact One Nation is having, look at the
    Internet.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>One Nation has its own home page which is now mandatory among political
    parties. It also is part of a Web ring, a facility which allows likeminded sites to link
    together. The party is the subject of the majority of discussions -- though flaming rows
    might be a better description -- in the usenet newsgroup aus.politics, the main political
    debating area for Australian Net users.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>But it is outside these now traditional areas of the Net that One Nation is
    pushing the new medium harder than any of its opponents. In the past month the <a
    href="http://www.collective.com.au/~martin/home.htm">Perth branch</a> of the party has
    been deluging a World Wide Web classified advertising site with appeals for support and
    money.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Last Friday the branch had posted 10 of the 41 classifieds at the <a
    href="http://www.aaa.com.au/world/australia/guest/wa_sa/read.shtml">Australia Announce
    Archive (AAA) WA Classifieds</a> site. The ads which have been posted regularly since June
    dominate the list and sit among an invitation to a rave party, a scheme to lose weight and
    a couple of real estate ads.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The man behind this enthusiastic use of the Web is the party's WA liaison
    officer and Perth branch president Martin Lebedinsky. He claims he has resorted to cyber
    advertising because &quot;</strong><em>The West Australian</em><strong> is not prepared to
    print the truth, and the general misrepresentation of facts about One Nation by our
    media&quot;.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Mr Lebedinsky describes response to his use of the Web as reasonable. Asked to
    define this, he said he received on average three email inquiries a day. He was not sure
    whether the responses were to the AAA site ads, or to the Perth branch's home page which
    he runs.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;I have signed 99 per cent of the people who inquired about One
    Nation,&quot; Mr Lebedinsky said last week. But he refused to give details of branch
    membership except to say it had risen 500 per cent in the last five months. There has been
    hate email among genuine inquiries, &quot;but that is life&quot;, he said.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Mr Lebedinsky's modest use of the Internet may seem innocent, even naive, to
    experienced Netizens, but it embarrasses the bigger political parties. The WA branch of
    the Liberal Party, for example, does not appear to have done a thing with its Web site
    since May last year. The home page even touts as a new feature an address by State
    president David Honey. The only problem is that Dr Honey lost that role to David Johnston
    last year.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>State Labor does not appear to have added much to its site since the 1996 WA
    election and still features an election sppech by Leader Geoff Gallop as the only entry on
    the speeches site.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bigger movers in State matters are the <a
    href="http://www.space.net.au/~ylmwa/">Young Liberals</a> who have a vigorous feedback
    area with arguments -- mostly about One Nation -- raging for pages and pages.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Federally, the Liberal Party's site seems to have ground to a halt; not that it
    offered much more than information on how to join the party. Federal Labor has at least
    jazzed up its site with scrolling headlines about policy initiatives, but has had to scrap
    its excellent Soapbox feedback forum because of the amount of hate mail containing bad
    language. The National Party, which offers an email feedback area but no public debating
    area, looks little different to 1996.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And the Democrats arguably have the best site, publishing all current policies
    and email contact addresses for MPs.</strong></p>
    <p><em>* The Net virgins, Mike and Diane, who I wrote about last week, have finally
    revealed all. No they did not make love on the Net. They did admit that their real names
    are not Mike and Diane, and neither is 18 nor a virgin. Their much hyped Our First Time
    site is now run by a condom manufacturer and features a film script of an imagined first
    sexual encounter.</em></p>
