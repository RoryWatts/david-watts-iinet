    <td valign="top" width="450"><strong>THE World Wide Web is a great place to make a stand.
    It costs little to learn and compile enough HTML to push your opinions into cyberspace.
    There are few restrictions about what can be said or who can say it.</strong><p><strong>This
    results in an amazing diversity of views with the power to entertain and enrich lives.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On one hand you could make a stand like Ohio man Jim Kenzig&nbsp; who is <a
    href="http://www.zoner.net/zoned/pres1.html">using the Web to tell President Bill Clinton</a>
    it is time to use the money wasted on the Lewinsky affair for research into finding a cure
    for diseases killing children.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Mr Kenzig lost his 10-year-old daughter Kristen to a rare form of brain tumour
    last year and he corresponds regularly via e-mail with the parents of children with
    similar afflictions. And many of them -- stirred by Mr Kenzig's stand on the Web -- have
    decided to e-mail Mr Clinton in similar vein.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Or consider the case of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. It used its Museum of
    Human Tolerance Web site last week to host a video-conference at which <a
    href="http://events.broadcast.com/events/swc/nanjingmassacre/">former Japanese soldiers
    recounted their role in atrocities</a> committed against Chinese, American and other
    Allied prisoners of war in China and Manchuria during World War 11.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A Japanese activist and crusader on behalf of World War II 'Comfort Women'
    across Asia also participated in the conference based in Tokyo, but able to seen and heard
    with the RealPlayer Web tool all around the world.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia also recently took to the Web in a growing campaign
    against ill-treatment. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/default.htm">BBC world news site</a>
    said last week that reports of looting, violence and rape committed against ethnic Chinese
    during riots in May were originally suppressed by the State media in China, with the
    authorities concerned it might affect ties with Indonesia and provoke demonstrations. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>&quot;But pictures, allegedly showing the burnt bodies of women raped and
    killed in the riots, have been circulating on the World Wide Web and Internet reports on
    the violence have filtered through to the public,&quot; the BBC reported. Indonesian Web
    sites have also come under attack from political hackers. The home page of a site at
    www.bkkbn.go.id was replaced with a message saying &quot;Warning from Chinese. This page
    is hacked for your national day. Please keep this page for 48 hours and punish the
    murderers in May immediately.&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Some use of the Web is a lot less high-minded. In fact one suspects there are
    users who come from the shallow end of the gene pool, as the Footy Show's Sam Newman would
    say. In fact it is Australian football where one new site that takes a stand is causing
    tidal waves of disbelief.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Someone -- no one has been able to unearth the identity yet -- has chosen the
    sharp end of the football season to set up the <a
    href="http://members.tripod.com/~AntiAFL/">Official Anti-Afl Web Site.</a> There is
    nothing intrinsically wrong with opposition to football. In fact anti-football movements
    have existed for years and have been seen as mostly decent and humorous.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>It is the manner in which the creator of the anti-AFL site has chosen to make
    their stand that is causing anger. He (it could be she but this seems unlikely) chose to
    announce that the site existed by posting an e-mail to an Australian football newsgroup.
    The message was entirely in capital letters (the Net equivalent of shouting) and started
    with the words: &quot;YOU STUPID PEOPLE ARE ALL MORONS!!!&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>It became steadily worse and by Saturday had provoked more than 30 replies
    mostly wondering about the author's intentions and state of mind.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The anti-AFL site itself is a curious piece of work with very little content.
    One correspondent to the newsgroup described it as: slow, full of bugs, no news, full of
    &quot;pathetic little messages&quot; and containing links with errors.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The site's creator did attract some traffic at least, which may have been the
    intention all the time. Perhaps after such a rude introduction the anti-AFL site may
    develop into an intelligent and witty spot where people can learn a little more about
    life.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Somehow I doubt it</strong></p>
