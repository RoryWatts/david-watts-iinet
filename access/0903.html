    <p><strong>IT IS not unknown to lose track of all time while using the Internet. The other
    day, or maybe it was night, I was doing the following:<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>* Listening to <a href="http://www.6pr.com.au/live.ram">6PR</a> on RealAudio;<br>
    * Contemplating what pizza to order online at <a href="http://www.pizzanow.com.au">PizzaNow</a>;<br>
    * Firing up a RealVideo trailer of the new <a href="http://www.austinpowers.com">Austin
    Powers</a> movie;<br>
    * Reading the scoreboard and commentary of the first West Indies-Australia Test from
    Trinidad while simultaneously checking the state of play in three Sheffield Shield matches
    at <a href="http://www-aus.cricket.org">CricInfo</a>;<br>
    * Checking out the progress of an online chat about the seriousness of Ben Cousins' knee
    injury.<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>The Net made all these cool pursuits possible for an old sports junkie like me,
    but I had a feeling real life on the outside might be passing me by.<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>To get in touch with nearby geography I decided to check out the state of the
    new artificial reef off Cottesloe. I did not actually leave the screen, get to my feet and
    physically go there, however. I went to the <a
    href="http://www.coastaldata.transport.wa.gov.au">Coastal Data Centre's Coastcam on the
    Web</a>. I clicked on a map and hey presto . . . it was pitch black. The Coastcam was
    working fine, presenting constantly updated pictures of the reef back to my Web browser.
    But it was 11 o'clock at night and the sun had long sizzled into the ocean past Rottnest.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
    Where had the day gone? And did it matter when I could easily hop on a virtual bike and <a
    href="http://www.rottnest.wa.gov.au">&quot;cycle&quot; around Rotto anyway</a>? Or was
    time important with the next edition of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York
    Times</a> due off the cyber presses, particularly now that it had dropped its subscription
    fees and rejoined the land of free information? Besides, I could just as easily be useful
    now and pay some bills through my online bank.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
    Time does not really matter on the Net. And despite the rapid progress of its technology
    -- witness RealAudio and Video or Macromedia Flash tours of Rottnest -- its user base is
    almost stuck in one place, truly timeless.<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>You will find after a couple of years that the majority of other people out
    there have only hopped on recently. The take-up rate is phenomenal. In the UK alone, more
    than 10,000 new users a day are signing up mainly through free ISPs which have decided to
    drop all fees and take a percentage of the income generated by British Telecom's timed
    local calls.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
    This flurry of new Netizens causes the wheel to be re-invented constantly. Just as you
    work up the courage to repartition your hard drive to install Linux, you will be asked why
    Yahoo gives so many different answers to a simple question. Or someone will demand to know
    why a site no longer exists or takes so long to load. Perhaps you will be stuck in a
    discussion group forever reminding new members not to post big attachments. Or certainly
    not to open them in case of nasty viruses.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
    Such timelessness deserves some sort of solution. The people at Swatch watches in
    Switzerland believe they have the answer with <a
    href="http://www.swatch.com/internettime/beatnik_fs_time.html">Internet Time</a> which
    they describe as revolutionary and based on a totally new unit of time, the beat of a
    Swatch, or 1 minute 26.4 seconds. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to find out more.
    Someone wants to know why their online bank won't send money through his fax machine.<br>
