    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#95B4EC"><h1><strong><font face="Arial">Democracy rules . . . a
    bit</font></strong></h1>
    <p><strong>ON THE surface, the Internet appears to be a wildly democratic medium. It all
    depends what you want to know though.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Even if the events of the past few days had not been as dramatic as the <a
    href="http://reports.guardian.co.uk/sp_reports/clinton/1379.html">impeachment of a US
    president</a> and a full-scale attack on Iraq, millions of people would have been well
    served by the latest pronouncements both official and unofficial.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In the US, the <a
    href="http://www.pub.whitehouse.gov/WH/Publications/html/Publications.html">White House</a>
    Web site maintains a very open page of press releases. President Clinton's address
    explaining the attack on Iraq was available to Web surfers almost immediately it was
    delivered.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In Australia, Prime Minister <a
    href="http://www.pm.gov.au/media/pressrel/index.htm">John Howard's site</a> displays all
    his public releases. His reaction to the Iraq attack was in cyberspace within hours of him
    making it.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>People wanting to digest the words of British Prime Minister Tony Blair about
    the Iraq conflict, or any other subject, possibly would have had a harder time finding
    them on the Web. The UK Parliament is the Mother of Parliaments, I know. However, I had a
    mother of a time tracking down a site similar to the White House's press releases or John
    Howard's official desk. To some people, the UK is a democracy in name only. This
    impression is emphasised when you discover the repository of official releases is held at
    the <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/coi/depts/today.html">Central Office of Information</a>
    (a name that the Kremlin would have been proud of) and that Mr Blair's statements do not
    seem to be there. Oh well, the BBC, the Guardian, the Times et al, cover the big events
    well enough to get Mr Blair's drift luckily.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/7days.html">United Nations</a> also
    serves up its public announcements on the Web. People who want to make sense of the Iraq
    attack can not only read all the UN resolutions, but also the reports of UNSCOM, the
    agency responsible for checking weapons.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Iraqi people have few of the above luxuries when trying to find reasons why
    they are dodging cruise missiles. The nation's <a
    href="http://www.iraqi-mission.org/current.html">Permanent Mission to the UN</a> in New
    York is the country's only official Internet presence. It carries a page brimming with
    Iraq's official stance on weapons inspection. But on Sunday there did not appear to be
    anything related to the most recent conflagration.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The only Iraqis likely to see the mission site are expatriates, however. The
    BBC reported last week that not only are computers prohibited in the country by UN
    sanctions, but phone lines damaged in the 1991 Gulf War have never been replaced. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>You may spare a thought for this technological wilderness, but such lack of
    information also exists much closer to home . . . at the <a href="http://www.acb.com.au">Australian
    Cricket Board</a> site. Considering the amount of flak the ACB has copped by its secrecy
    over the Waugh-Warne bookie scandal, you might have thought it would now be more up-front
    about the matter. Its official site has a section called Newsline where, according to the
    blurb on the page: &quot;. . . you will find out all the latest news about the Australian
    team and its matches, including the official news releases from the ACB.&quot;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The latest announcement -- checked on Sunday -- was dated October 21 and
    concerned changes to the domestic season schedule. Not a peep about Mark Waugh and Shane
    Warne.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I have e-mailed the ACB twice via the feedback page about what appears to be a
    major omission. But so far, silence has been the stern reply.</strong></p>
