I am a dull and simple lad<br>
Can not tell water from champagne<br>
And I have never met the queen<br>
And I wish I could have all that he has got<br>
I wish I could be like David Watts<br>
<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
<br>
And when I lie on my pillow at night<br>
I dream I could fight like David Watts<br>
Lead the school team to victory<br>
And take my exams and pass the lot<br>
<br>
(Wish I could be)<br>
Wish I could be like David Watts<br>
(Wish I could be)<br>
Wish I could be like David Watts<br>
(Wish I could be)<br>
Conduct my life like David Watts<br>
(Wish I could be)<br>
I wish I could be like David Watts<br>
<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
<br>
He is the head boy at the school<br>
He is the captain of the team<br>
He is so gay and fancy free<br>
And I wish all his money belonged to me<br>
I wish I could be like David Watts<br>
<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
<br>
And all the girls in the neighborhood<br>
Try to go out with David Watts<br>
They try their best but can't succeed<br>
For he is of pure and noble breed<br>
<br>
Wish I could be like<br>
Wish I could be like<br>
Wish I could be like<br>
<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa<br>
