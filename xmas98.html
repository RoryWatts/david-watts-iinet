    <p><u><strong>David:</strong></u> Surprisingly little change. Started going to the gym in
    August and now looks like Superman (you can always dream)<br>
    <u><strong>Chris:</strong></u> Pat Rafter, playing tennis, lots of sleep and more Pat
    Rafter . . . she can dream too. As lovely and busy as always.<br>
    <u><strong>Alana:</strong></u> Super first year at high school. Lots of new friends,
    playing sax in school band, doing jazz ballet. For her 13th birthday, had 13 girls to
    sleep over (it was a failure . . . they didn't sleep).<br>
    <u><strong>Rory:</strong></u> Tough transition to his new school. But has taken up
    skateboarding with a passion. No one understands a word he says now, except other
    10-year-old boys. So what is an acid-drop, ollie 360 flip kick?<br>
    <u><strong>Gizmo</strong></u> (dog): Hoping he won't mark the Christmas tree as his
    territory again this year.</td>
