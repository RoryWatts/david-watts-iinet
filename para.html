  <h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">The Paradox of Our Age </h1>
  <hr>
  <b><p>We have taller buildings, but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower
  viewpoints;<br>
  we spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy it less. <br>
  We have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences, but less time;<br>
  we have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but less judgment;<br>
  more experts, but more problems; more medicine, but less wellness. <br>
  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little,<br>
  drive too fast, get too angry too quickly, stay up too late, get up too tired,<br>
  read too seldom, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.</p>
  <p>We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. <br>
  We talk too much, love too seldom and lie too often. <br>
  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; <br>
  We've added years to life, not life to years. <br>
  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet
  the new neighbor. <br>
  We've conquered outer space, but not inner space; <br>
  We've done larger things, but not better things; <br>
  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul; <br>
  We've split the atom, but not our prejudice; <br>
  We write more, but learn less; plan more, but accomplish less. </p>
  <p>We've learned to rush, but not to wait; we have higher incomes, but lower morals;<br>
  more food, but less appeasement; more acquaintances, but fewer friends;<br>
  more effort, but less success. <br>
  We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but
  have less communication;<br>
  We've become long on quantity, but short on quality. <br>
  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; <br>
  tall men, and short character; steep profits, and shallow relationships. <br>
  These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare; more leisure and less fun; more
  kinds of food, but less nutrition. <br>
  These are days of two incomes, but more divorce; of fancier houses, but broken homes. <br>
  </p>
  <p>These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one-night
  stands, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.</p>
  <p>It is a time when there is much in the show window <br>
  and nothing in the stockroom.</p>
