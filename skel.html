<h5><strong>BY DAVID WATTS <br>
</strong><br>
ALMOST every candidate for the US presidential election is crooked or has some 
other nasty skeleton in the closet. </h5>
<p>A Californian political watchdog committee, Real People for Real 
Change, has chosen the Internet to dump dirt on not only the presidential 
frontrunners like Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, but also the never-wases like 
Morry Taylor and Bob Dorman. </p>
<p>The campaign on the World Wide Web is designed to make the more 
than 20 million US Net users see past traditional media coverage which is 
said to be controlled by vested interests and lacking courage. </p>
<p>In the world of Watergate that is a big statement. </p>
<p>Real People for Real Change have listed an incredible number of foibles 
for presidential candidates. </p>
<p>Republican frontrunner Bob Dole is guilty of giving numerous political 
favours to big money campaign contributors. </p>
<p>He is taken to task for his temper, ruthlessness and for being a divorcee 
who champions family values. </p>
<p>President Bill Clinton gets by far the worst treatment. </p>
<p>He is accused (as he always is) of being a dope smoker, draft dodger, 
shady dealer through Whitewater and of being the ultimate baby boomer 
who just wants to go along with the crowd. </p>
<p>Even worse he is blasted for his musical tastes --- the President is a fan 
of Hootie and the Blowfish which the Net site describes as a lame band. </p>
<p>Some of the other skeletons brought out of the closet include: </p>
<p><b>Pat Buchanan </b>hypocrite who has lived off the Government and media 
all his life while constantly attacking them. </p>
<p><b>Lamar Alexander </b>Guilty of dozens of sweetheart deals with business 
cronies and financial supporters &quot;that make Hillary Clinton's $100,000 
commodities trade look puny&quot;. </p>
<p><b>Steve Forbes </b>branded a rich kid with little real world experience; also a 
bad manager and draft dodger guilty of sleazy land deals and hiding his 
tax return. </p>
<p>The only candidate who escapes Real People's wrath is Republican 
Richard Lugar &quot;actually a pretty upstanding guy&quot;. </p>
<p>Real People was registered with the Federal Election Commission in 
1992 as a non-affiliated, independent political action committee. </p>
<p>The Real People say on the Net that they are not pouring vitriol on 
candidates for any purpose other than to show Americans the truth about 
politicians. </p>
<p>They claim all members are unpaid, they have no political affiliations and 
they want to do something about the state of politics and truth other than 
sit in a bar and moan about it. </p>
<p>Which is exactly how the organisation was created. A group of friends 
got together in a bar during the 1992 presidential race to whinge, and 
Real People was born. </p>
<p>During the last election they ran advertisements on TV in two States to 
voice their opinions, but this time have found the Net easier and cheaper. </p>
<p>Real People attacks the US media and entertainment business for 
devaluing politics and failing to investigate on the public's behalf. </p>
<p>They say, with a few notable exceptions like the Wall Street Journal, the 
media simply puts a Republican statement and balances it with a 
Democrat statement, allowing politicians to lie, cheat and distort with 
ease. </p>
<p>The Skeleton Closet site is one of hundreds on the presidential race. </p>
