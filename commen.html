<h1><font size=6><tt>ABA report stresses<br>
family values</tt></font></h1>
<h4><tt>By David Watts</tt></h4>
<b>THE Australian Broadcasting Authority's recommendations yesterday to go easy on Internet censorship --- and Senator Richard Alston's acceptance of them --- represent a return to family values and individual  responsibility.<p>
The ABA's call for parental supervision, self-censorship and an industry code of practice puts the regulatory ball at the feet of Australia's one million Net users.<p>
It is a move away from Government intervention and sends a message to politicians to tread cautiously in areas they know little about and which have the potential to change society for good.<p>
ABA chairman Peter Webb has led a probe that has put much thought into the rapidly changing world of technology and its influence on the public.<p>
Mr Webb telegraphed the ABA findings in two speeches earlier this year in which he emphasised the global power of the Net as a place for the free exchange of ideas.<p>
But he also observed the need for the community to have standards and try to minimise the harmful effects of some of material on the Net.<p>
The ABA appears not to have bowed to hysterical outcries that would have us believe the Net is just a sewer of pornography.<p>
Its report acknowledges that bad things happen in the best places. The exponential growth of the Internet means more and more prying eyes will see things they do not like.
There is pornography on the Net, and bad language, and racist rubbish.<p>
There is also The Bible, The Koran, Shakespeare and Leonardo da Vinci.<p>
Overall the good things outnumber the bad about 9-1, a figure one US survey says is changing  rapidly as the Net becomes a source of information for more women and families.<p>
The thing to understand about the Net is that is as unlike traditional media as television was unlike cave drawing.<p>
No one person or organisation controls it. Anyone with a computer, a modem and some basic formatting knowledge can publish a document and lodge it in cyberspace.<p>
What they convey is primarily their business but the fact they have put it on the Net means it can become the business of many others. And whether those others choose to accept it is their business.<p>
It is known as freedom of expression and it is being practised in a way unknown on Earth before.<p>
Adults started the Net to exchange information and they are continuing to do so in increasing numbers and with increasing sophistication.<p>
Children are learning that the Net is a powerful place for education and entertainment. Unlike TV, they can interact.<p>
A Government putting its spoke in to determine what all these people see is not following the spirit of freedom of exchange of information.<p>
Adults setting standards for children, that is parents regulating the Net, is a return to family values of the most fundamental and far-reaching kind.<p>
And it can be done without disrupting anyone else's access to the information they want to see.<p>
