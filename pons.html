A <b>glioma</b> is disruption to the cells of the glial, the supporting tissue in the brain.<P>
The<b> brainstem</b> is the connection between the brain and spinal cord.<BR>
It is made up of three sections:<b> midbrain, pons and medulla.</b><P>
The <b>pons</b> is the site of the roots of nerves controlling facial movement and sensation and eye movement, among other important functions. It is also like a highway where many nerves -- controlling body movement -- pass and switch over en route to the spine.<P>
The <b>medulla</b> is a critical area with the roots of nerves controlling lung movement and heartbeat.<P>
A <b>tumour</b> in the brainstem pressures or destroys vital nerves, leading to possible paralysis, nausea, headaches, swallowing difficulties, double vision and slurred speech, among other things.<P>
