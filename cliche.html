        <h4><i>Friday March 15 1996</i><br>
        BY DAVID WATTS</h4>
        <h5>STOP me if you've seen this film. It goes like this.</h5>
        <p>The hero is a divorced, macho detective ... the best
        on the force. But despite always solving cases
        brilliantly, the gruff, temperamental captain explodes
        every time he sees him and suspends him from duty.<br>
        The hero then tracks down the villain, a well-dressed
        foreigner with perfect teeth and even better English
        accent whose henchmen carry briefcases with either
        weapons or perfect rows of fresh banknotes.<br>
        The hero teams up with a feisty shoulder-pad wearing
        smart woman journalist, not a hair out of place, who
        initially can't stand the dinosaur-like machismo of the
        hero who drinks his whisky from a shot glass and always
        gets in a fight the minute he goes into a bar. What she
        doesn't understand is that his best friend died in
        Vietnam just seconds after showing the hero a picture of
        his sweetheart.<br>
        The hero and the woman journalist fight continuously ...
        she even socks him one ... until one night they are
        pursued by the bad guys and she trips and sprains her
        ankle. He has to guide her to safety.<br>
        They fall rapturously in love, hit the bed together and
        make the most amazing love straight away, reaching mutual
        and simultaneous climax.<br>
        After, they lie with the sheets pulled up to her chin and
        his waist. Their cigarettes come from a packet whose
        brand name stares the camera right in the lens.<br>
        Then the bad guys capture the pair and tie them together
        in an abandoned building. The main villain sets a time
        bomb and we all know just how much time the hero has to
        defuse it, because, despite being thrown together in a
        hurry in a creepy warehouse, the bomb has a perfect LCD
        display showing the audience exactly how much time the
        hero has to untie himself and his girlfriend.<br>
        Fortunately their captors have botched the rope-tying and
        left a big enough gap between the hero's hands that he
        can reach a mirror out of the journalist's handbag and
        deflect the only rays of sunlight creeping into the
        building on to the rope and burn through it.<br>
        Having escaped, the pair catch a conveniently-located and
        available lift (the only one that works), hop into a taxi
        that just happens to cruise past, pay the driver the
        exact fare, despite their ordeal and still looking a
        million dollars engage the baddies in gun play.<br>
        In the battle, the hero is outnumbered 50 to one but
        shoots everyone except the chief villain.<br>
        Bullets expended, the pair resort to swords. Just as the
        villain takes the upper hand, the hero pushes him down
        stairs, previously unseen, and the villain dies at the
        bottom a twisted wreck.<br>
        The hard hero and now doting journalist buy a dream
        house, somehow affording five bedrooms and Vogue
        furnishings despite the fact they are both out of work,
        make more perfect love, crack witty one-liners and live
        happily ever after.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Oh you've seen it, well bits of it.<br>
        It's the ultimate film, built on some of the ripest
        cliches around. But in terms of predictability it doesn't
        even scrape the surface.<br>
        All those cliches are on display on the Internet's World
        Wide Web at a site called <b><i>The Movie Cliche List</i></b>.
        The site is run by an American, Giancarlo Cairella, who
        invites Net users to send in their favourite, or least
        liked ... in fact any ... cliches that they see on
        screen.<br>
        He has arranged collected cliches under 72 headings, but
        warns he is still assembling them from a huge backlog.<br>
        Categories include alcohol, aliens, helicopters, kids,
        middle ages (the evil king always has all his gold in a
        cart when he rides through the bandit-infested forest and
        that cart will be the only one that gets stuck in the
        gentle stream), pregnancy, prison, teenagers (they have
        every square centimetre of their messy but elegantly
        trendy bedroom covered in the latest posters), villains,
        war and wood (it never hurts when it is smashed over a
        hero's head).<br>
        This being the Internet the biggest section of cliches is
        reserved for computers. In films, computers always have
        the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitors always display inch-high letters; </li>
            <li>Commands are in plain English (eg: get the secret
                files); </li>
            <li>No one ever makes a typing mistake or
                paradoxically uses the space bar when typing at
                high speed; </li>
            <li>When the power plant or mission control is the
                scene of a battle, all the computers will
                explode; </li>
            <li>When a computer malfunctions you can tell by the
                puff of smoke coming from the screen. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The list goes on and it's addictive as are all the
        sections. Consider these random selections:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Animals --- the snake will always bite the
                heroine first even if she is surrounded by 30
                men; </li>
            <li>Environment --- thunder and lightning always
                happen at the same time; </li>
            <li>Helicopters --- bad guys' helicopters explode in
                flames when they malfunction. Good guys' copters
                drift to the ground where the hero emerges
                slightly scratched but without a hair out of
                place; </li>
            <li><b>Heroes -- go without food or sleep for 72
                hours straight. The only injuries they get in
                fights are small cuts at the corner of the mouth
                which they wipe with the back of the hand; </b></li>
            <li>Houses --- all Paris apartments have a view of
                the Eiffel Tower; </li>
            <li>Phones --- all numbers begin with 555; </li>
            <li>Radio --- the radio will be turned on just as a
                special announcement about escaped lunatics is
                made; </li>
            <li>Shopping ---- bags of groceries are always made
                of brown paper and have celery sticking out the
                top. Something always falls out of them when
                they're brought home; </li>
            <li>Smoking --- Smokers only light up a cigarette at
                dramatic or romantic moments, otherwise they have
                no craving for nicotine; </li>
        </ul>

        users can e-mail their favourites to the site at this
        address</a>:<br>
        I'm going to add --- all animated dogs always steal
        perfect strings of sausages from street butchers who are
        always big, hairy and possibly Italian.</p>
