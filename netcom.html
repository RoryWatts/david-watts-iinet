</u></b><font size=4><b>By David Watts</b></font><p><font size=4>THE Labor and Liberal parties have failed to take advantage 
of arguably the most democratic medium available in this 
campaign --- the Internet.</font> </p>
<p>The Liberal Party is by far the worst offender, shrinking into an old-fash 
ioned comfortable hole apparently safe from public gaze while pretending it 
is up with the times and accountable to the people. </p>
<p>The Internet is accessed by possibly one million Australians and probably 
95 per cent of them would be voters. </p>
<p>It is an unparalleled medium for exchange of views and ideas. It is argued 
that the Net is in its infancy, but millions of people throughout the world 
know they can say what they believe publicly and have a global audience. </p>
<p>Yet the powerhouses driving our political parties are inept at doing the same 
thing as their constituents. Worse, they firmly believe they are doing okay on 
this new frontier. </p>
<p>The Liberals are prime examples. Until last week end the party presented its 
policies, its philosophies, how to become a member, latest Press releases 
and miscellaneous information at an unofficial but party- authorised site on 
the World Wide Web. </p>
<p>At the weekend the party launched an official site with less, not more 
information, and less pub lic accountability. </p>
<p>The man who main tained the old site and helped prepare the new, 
Canberra technical officer and party follower David Moss, claims that the 
inclusion of e-mail addres ses for all Liberal candi dates is a major demo 
cratic triumph. </p>
<p>The bulk of any e-mail sent to the addresses sup plied would actually go to 
a central sorting office for distribution ... or not ... to the candidate. </p>
<p>It is surface democracy, a clumsy attempt to look accountable. Nowhere 
does the aver age voter have a place to put his thoughts in the open, and 
most impor tantly, have his questions, fears or doubts publicly replied to by 
a politician. </p>
<p><font size=4><u>A public meeting in a sweltering town hall in the suburbs is 
far more democratic than this high-technology excuse for an 
election husting.</u></font> </p>
<p>The positive side is that all Liberal policies are in the open. Mr Moss claims 
more than 700 people a day are reading them. </p>
<p>Labor was first on the Web of the two with an official site more than a year 
ago. It is full of party history, educational resources, international links and 
philosophy. </p>
<p>And it has a powerful section called Soapbox where any person can say 
what they like about poli tics and be published. </p>
<p>This has led to a lot of anti-Labor anti-Paul Keat ing mail. But the party has 
at least had the guts to admit this is the price of democ racy. </p>
<p>But like the Liberal site there is no feedback from the politicians themselves. 
In the US, admittedly into cyberspace well before Australia, presidential 
candidates have virtually been nailed to the wall and told to respond to 
questions from the public. </p>
<p>All answers are open to public gaze. Labor says it has not made the site a 
major campaign tool, preferring to use it as an information source. </p>
<p>Dennis Perry, a spokes man for the Labor site, said yesterday that by 1999 
he expected the scene would be far differ ent. </p>
<p>More candidates would have e-mail addresses and the potential of the Web 
would be used to more telling effect. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=4><u>To do that our political parties should first 
realise that the Net is a two-way street.<br>
If they don't become more accountable, then 
just like in any office or town, the rest of the 
peo ple, in this case the voters, will set their 
own agenda and put it on the Net. And let 
the world know about it.</u></font></p>
