NOTHING separates Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator in the war of the World Wide Web browsers. 
But the important qualification is that they can be compared only on Windows95 or NT 4.0 platforms. Explorer has not been built to work on the other 14 operating platforms that Navigator dominates.<P>
Microsoft claims that five of those platforms are similar Unix-based ones which account for just one per cent of the browser market.
Maybe so. But among the others are Windows 3.1 and Macintosh which still are used by a majority of Internet surfers.<P>
The fact that Windows95 is now the standard for new PCs, and the Net population is still doubling every year, mean that Win95 --- which will have the new Explorer bundled in it --- will be the number one platform soon.
That means Explorer will be more than a serious threat to Navigator. It has the potential to beat it.<P>
WestWeb loaded the new version 3.0 releases of both browsers last week and subjected them to three days of tests covering ease of installation, download speed, speed and stability in accessing Web pages, ability to handle Java, video and audio and mail and news-reading operation.<P>
Both had as many good points as bad, but overall there was nothing to split them.
Net users looking for a definitive answer as to which browser to use with Windows95 are best advised to work out what their main requirements on the Web are, then seek the browser that handles them best.<P>
For example, if the amount of hard disk space used by a program is a consideration, then Navigator would be the choice.
Netscape has bundled its applications into a 5.7MB package which can be downloaded in 31 minutes compared with Microsoft's 7.8MB that takes 43 minutes.<P>
Installation of Navigator can be twice as fast and offers users the choice of where to put the software. Bookmark files, initialisation file and cache directory -- where the products of a surfing session are stored automatically for quick retrieval -- are also easy to find and manipulate.<P>
Explorer on the other hand chooses where it will go, steals Netscape bookmarks for itself -- handy if you knew what the file was called --- and has four cache directories, hidden in the Windows folder, which WestWeb's ACDSee graphics viewer could not access.<P>
The Netscape cache is set at a manageable 5MB and can be cleared quickly, but the Explorer cache is set on a sliding scale that is accessed by going to options and advanced and clicking on a small folder dealing with temporary files. That is, it is not readily apparent nor user friendly to manipulate.<P>
After three days using both browsers, WestWeb's test computer, with a 540MB hard drive, was more than 20MB worse off.<P>
However, if speed of accessing pages, stability on the network and ease of operation are the priorities, Explorer heads Navigator.
Explorer takes an average 18 seconds to call to screen; Navigator takes 30 with much more hard disk activity.<P>
Both access Web pages in similar times, but WestWeb with 8MB of RAM, found Explorer far more stable and less hard-drive intensive.
The system crashed totally twice and threw up three fatal exception errors when Navigator was trying to access Web pages with Java enhancements.
It also threw a fatal error immediately after Navigator took 10 minutes to print four pages off the Web. Explorer did the same job in eight minutes with little hard disk activity. Offline, Explorer again outperformed Navigator in printing, though both accessed the hard drive for stored pages in about the same time.<P>
Remarkably, Explorer mastered Java pages far better than Navigator, which brought the program to the Web in the first place.<P>
Both were so similar in reproduction of Real Audio that it was impossible to split, but Navigator's inline video was a treat compared with Explorer's.<P>
Navigator required only a mouse click to stop or start a seamless video while Explorer took nearly as long to finally play its video as it would to actually download and replay offline.<P>
Mail and news are similarly easy to configure and friendly to use on both browsers, but Navigator's ability to display image files in the same document window as mail or new is superior to Explorer.<P>
Explorer needs the user to click on a paper clip icon, then a file name before it decodes then displays an image file on the browser screen.<P>

THE WestWeb browser war tests were performed on equipment and under conditions meant to resemble the average user's environment.<P>
A 486 DX4/100 PC with 8MB of RAM and a 540MB hard drive were hooked up via a NetComm Roadster 28.8kbps modem to Perth Internet provider iiNet Technologies using a normal dial-up account which restricts use to 80 minutes when there is heavy demand on the network.
As far as possible comparisons in downloading material from the Web were made at the same time of day or night. <P>
The main difference between the test environment and a real one was that WestWeb had both browsers loaded on the system at all times.<P>
Here is a summary of the 10 tests:<P>
<b>Size:</b> winner <b>Navigator</b><br>
Navigator is 5772KB, Explorer 7869KB<P>
<b>Download</b> time: <b>Navigator</b><br>
Both were downloaded from Australian sites. Explorer was downloaded using Navigator 3.0 beta 5; Navigator was downloaded using Explorer 3.0. Navigator took 31min10secs, Explorer 43mins30secs.<P>
<b>Installation: Navigator</b><br>
Navigator took three minutes to install and offered a choice of directories in which to put it. Explorer took five minutes after twice refusing to install. It finally went in, offering no choices, when the "custom install" yes button was clicked.<P>
<b>Access: Explorer</b><br>
Explorer took an average 18 seconds to call to screen. Navigator took 30 with hard disk activity continuing for another three to four seconds after.<P>
<b>Surfing: Explorer</b><br>
Access to five Web pages was timed, as was the reload time from cache. Stability and hard disk activity were also important factors.<br>
<b>Explorer access times:</b> Yahoo 32 seconds (5 to reload); Disney 53 seconds (45 reload); CNN (minimal Java content) 75 seconds (21 reload); part one of ABA report (text only) 38 seconds (9 reload); West Coast Eagles (graphic intensive) 1min12s (24 reload).<P>
<b>Navigator times:</b> Yahoo 30s (13 reload); Disney 33s (7); CNN no figure; fatal error after 1min15s caused system reset; ABA 1min (10); Eagles first attempt crashed after 1min, then took 1min10s (30).<P>
<b>Mail/News: Navigator:</b><br>
Both are easily configured and friendly to use. Navigator warns when new mail has arrived and decodes and displays image attachment files or newsgroup articles in the same window as e-mail.<P>
<b>Java: Explorer</b><br>
Explorer accessed all Java-enhanced pages smoothly with few pauses to load the applets. Unfortunately Navigator caused the system to crash while trying to access the main test page, c|net, and constantly accessed the hard disk and paused on others.<P>
<b>Audio: tie</b><br>
No real difference.<P>
<b>Video: Navigator</b><br>
Simple one-click use and minimal waiting on a Netscape video demonstration. Explorer took 10 times as long to start playing a demonstration video on the Microsoft demonstration page.<P>
<b>Print: Explorer</b><br>
Explorer took 8min to print a four-page Web site online; Navigator took 10 with continual hard disk activity. Offline, Explorer was one minute faster and less intensive again.<P>
<b>Overall: tie</b><br>
WestWeb's conclusion is that there should be a merged product --- either Netsoft Explorigator or Microscape Naviplorer --- that takes the best of both.
There probably won't.<P>

        <B> 
USERS appear evenly split in the browser war while computer reviewers are more inclined to praise Microsoft Internet Explorer.
The praise is for Microsoft's achievement in catching up to Netscape in one year, matching and in some cases beating the technology that has revolutionised Internet use.<P>
A troll through Perth newsgroups and the global alt.windows95 found these two user statements to be fairly representative of the pros and cons of the browsers.<P>
"I find the (MS Internet Explorer) mail and news clients far too basic and I'm still unconvinced that it is a better browser than Netscape - especially in the Gold version which allows editing of Web pages."<P>
In the Explorer corner: "I just wanted everyone to know that IE 3.0  is way better than Netscape. Netscape always gives me a bunch of illegal operations. With IE, you can specify fonts in your Web page, turn the underline off links, change the size of the font while browsing, see ActiveX and Visual Basic programs, as well as Java, Frames, Floating Frames, and much more."<P>
At the prominent Internet site run by c|net, reviewer Rex Baldazo waxed lyrical about Internet Explorer.<P>
"Microsoft did it. Internet Explorer 3.0 matches nearly all the features you've grown to love in Netscape Navigator. By adding some interesting new technologies of its own--and a promotional offer that delivers $400 worth of free access to Net content--Microsoft has made Internet Explorer 3.0 a great choice for people running Windows 95 or Windows NT," he wrote.<P>
 "Nobody runs Java better.  IE 3.0 remains the fastest Windows Java engine we've tested. IE 3.0 supports more of the HTML 3.2 standard than Netscape does, including style sheets."<P>
 Baldazo appeared less enthusiastic about Netscape Navigator.
"Not much has changed since our first look at what was then code-named Netscape Navigator Atlas. Navigator 3.0 is a good upgrade to a great product."<P>
He rightly praised Navigator's improved mail and news features, which are a highlight of the program.<P>
PC Week magazine said Explorer was equal to or better than Navigator in almost every respect. InfoWorld Electric Review said Explorer was easier and more enjoyable to use than any browser tested.<P>
