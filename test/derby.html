<b>FREMANTLE came as close as they ever have yesterday to knocking over Perth`s home-town bullies the West Coast Eagles, but only after they all-but wrote themselves out of contention in the first half.<p>

In a gripping last 15 minutes at Subiaco before a packed house, Fremantle`s star recruit Tony Modra emerged as both hero and villain. He raised the prospect of an unlikely Dockers` win with a deft tap back to team-mate Craig Callaghan, then missed two set shots to let the Eagles hold on by four points.<p>

Modra was hardly the lone culprit in front of goal in the last quarter as Fremantle posted a wayward five goals nine to finish a straight kick in arrears.<p>

But as new coach Damian Drum will no doubt have pointed out, the Dockers wouldn`t have needed to rely on such a miraculous comeback had they not let the Eagles skip out to a 47-point lead.<p>

Drum said he felt `sick in the guts` at the result, the Dockers` ninth straight derby defeat. He said Fremantle failed to `show up` for the first quarter, before squandering several chances to steal the game.<p>

`It is like losing a final and you`re out of it,` he said. `We had an opportunity to win four points and we just blew it.` Eagles coach Michael Malthouse said the final quarter should serve as a `wake-up` call to his side, who scraped home without the services of veterans Peter Matera and Chris Mainwaring and with an underdone Glen Jakovich and Brett Heady.<p>

Malthouse said he felt his runners losing steam 10 minutes before halftime.<p>

Any pre-season hopes of an overnight Fremantle renaissance were scotched within the first 20 minutes as the Eagles powered to a six-goal lead through Chad Morrison, Scott Cummings, Ben Cousins, Fraser Gehrig and Phillip Matera.<p>

Drum has set about drilling a new, direct brand of football into his club but the result yesterday was plenty of high, long kicks forward easily rebounded by the taller, more experienced Eagles defenders.<p>

If Modra was to have any chance against Ashley McIntosh he had to have it delivered out in front and into space.<p>

Instead, the Fremantle ball carriers sent them low, high, wobbly and wide.<p>

Only a well-deserved goal from first-gamer Trent Carroll, who had an intriguing duel with teenager David Wirrpunda, and a timely snap from ruckman Matthew Burton kept Fremantle vaguely in touch at the first change.<p>

The Eagles built on their 38-point, quarter-time lead when Cummings marked out in front, popped it over to Michael Braun, who in turn found Jason Ball lumbering into the square.<p>

Fremantle answered through Brodie Holland and it was his remonstration with Ben Cousins after the kick that led to a near all-in push-and-shove in the Dockers` forward pocket. No doubt the AFL will be tallying up the fines from the tag-team te * te-a * -te * te. Docker Jess Sinclair for one was booked for a charge on Cousins.<p>

The Eagles unveiled their new forward structure built around the straight-leading work of Port Power recruit Scott Cummings, who finished with four goals.<p>

Cummings` team-mates relished the new-found focal point, swooping into the space created in the wake of the burly full-forward.<p>

Dean Kemp was back to his ball-getting best, picking up 25 possessions despite the attention of former Tiger Ashley Prescott, Brad Wira and Dodd and new skipper Chris Bond.<p>

Like derbies past, the Eagles` superior body strength came to the fore with several Dockers failing to keep their feet in the clinches. And Jakovich rucked virtually unopposed while Matthew Burton and Michael Gardiner rested.<p></b>
